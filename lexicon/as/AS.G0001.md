<span class="asitalic">alpha</span>, the first letter of the Greek alphabet. As a numeral, <span class="asgreek">αʹ</span> = 1, <span class="asgreek">α͵</span> = 1000. As a prefix, it appears to have at least two and perhaps three distinct senses:
<span class="asbullet"><span class="asbold">1.</span> <span class="asgreek">ἀ-</span> (before a vowel, <span class="asgreek">ἀν-</span>) <span class="asitalic">negative</span>, as in <span class="asgreek">ἄ-γνωστος</span>, <span class="asgreek">ἄ-δικος</span>.</span>
<span class="asbullet"><span class="asbold">2.</span> <span class="asgreek">ἀ-</span>, <span class="asgreek">ἁ-</span> <span class="asitalic">copulative</span>, indicating community and fellowship, as in <span class="asgreek">ἁ-πλοῦς</span>, <span class="asgreek">ἀ-κολουθέω</span>, <span class="asgreek">ἀ-δελφός</span>.</span>
<span class="asbullet"><span class="asbold">3.</span> An <span class="asitalic">intensive</span> force (LS, s. <span class="asgreek">α</span>), as in <span class="asgreek">ἀ-τενίζω</span> is sometimes assumed (but v. Boisacq, s.v.).</span>
