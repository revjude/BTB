Lexicons for the tagged texts used by STEPBible, based on BHS for OT and LSJ for NT, backwardly compatible for any tagging based on Strong numbers. 

Extended Strongs for Greek is backwardly compatible with original Strong and NASB, and extended to include all NT variants and LXX + variants.

The Brief lexicon is based on the Abbott-Smith definitions, and is edited to conform with the extended Strongs. For a few words where Abbott-Smith lacks a definition, one is supplied  from MiddleLiddel \(MD\) or STEPBible scholars

The Full lexicon is edited from the Full LSJ by Tyndale House scholars, formatted to make it easy to read, with expansion of abbreviations and revealing examples from Greek literature on hover over dates of the earliest source \(added by Tyndale House\)

### Fields: 

**EStrong\#** = Extended Strong's Numbers: 
- **G0001** - **G5624** Strongs numbers from original set made by Strong for Greek behind the KJV  
$\quad$ \(**G3203**-**G3302** which aren't used for some reason\)
- **G5627** - **G5799** = Greek morphology codes  \(these numbers aren't used in this lexicon\) 
- **G5800** - **G5893** = Greek Synonyms - see http://studybible.info/strongs/G5800  \(these numbers aren't used in this lexicon\) 
- **G6000** - **G6090** = Extra Strongs Numbers in NASB mainly for variants not known to Strong. \(they remain the same so it is backward-compatible with NASB\) 
- **G6100** - **G9979** = Extra Greek from Apostolic Bible Project mainly for LXX words not found in NT \(including Greek names that don't occur in the Hebrew\) 
- **G6091** - **G6099**, **G9980** - **G9999** = Extra Greek for variants which are not included in NASB or Apostolic Bible  
- **G10000** - **19999** = Greek equivalent of Strongs Hebrew numbers for names and transliterated words eg  Abagtha \(H0005\) = G10005. When there is a NT equivalent, this is the STEP\_LexicalTag
- **G20000** - **G20199** = Words where  the Full LSJ entry refers to the LXX, but they are not referred to in the AB tagging because they only occur in non-Protestant canons or in MSS other than Vaticanus \(used by AB\)

**Strong numbers**	Three sets of numbers are included: eStrong, dStrong & uStrong. A lexicon or tagging system will normally use only one set, depending on its purpose, though it may be useful to keep both dStrong & uStrong. 

Any record can be deleted if it does not have  a number for the system that is to be used. Each system has different advantages: 

- **eStrong**	This is the standard Extended Strongs which conforms with the subdivisions of words in BDB \(Brown Driver Brigg's lexicon, largely followed by later lexicons\). This was done by OS \(OpenScriptures.org\)
- **dStrong**	This is STEPBible's Disambiguated Strongs which has separate numbers when a  name is used for different people or places, and when a word has significantly different sub-meanings. See TinyURL.com/DisambiguatedStrongs. 
- **uStrong**	This is STEPBible's Unified Strongs  which has a single number for an individual's various  names, and a single number for a word that has different forms or spellings or that has a Hebrew and Aramaic versions. 
For example: 	Strong used G2264 for all three people in the NT named Herod \(the Great, Anitipas and Agrippa I\), and a different number for "Herodian" which describes Herod Anitipas. 

* **eStrong** doesn't divide up any names in the NT \(like it does in the OT\) because eStrong was created to map Strongs to the Hebrew lexicon BDB. 

- **dStrong** has a unique number for each person: G2264G, G2264H, G2264I. As in the OT, letters start at G when there is no "a" or "b" etc in eStrongs \(which never happens in Greek\) 

* **uStrong** has only one unique number for each individual, so a search for that number finds all the places where that person is mentioned however their name is spelled.

**Greek** = unicode lexical form. Based on LSJ but conforming to BADG when the difference may be confusing. 

**Transliteration** - The closest English representation of the word.

**Morph** = simple gramatical value of the main word represented as Language:Type-Gender-Extra. 
$\quad$ **Language:Type-Gender-Extra.**
- **Language** is A=Aramaic, H=Hebrew, G=Greek and N=Name \(which is not language specific\). 
- **Type** is A=Adjective, Adv=Adverb, Art=Article, Cond=Conditional, Conj=Conjunction, Cor=Correlative, DemP=Demonstrative Pn, ImpP=Impersonal Pn, Intg=Interogative, Intj=Interjection, N=Noun, Neg=Negative, Part=Particle, Prep=Preposition, PerP=Personal Pn, PosP=Possessive Pn, RefP=Reflexive Pn, RelP=Relative Pn, V=Verb. 
- **Gender** is F=Female, M=Male, N=Neuter, C=Common and P or S is optionally added for Plural Singular
- **Extra** for Names is L=Location, P=Person, LG/PG=Gentilic, T=Title \(i.e. any other capitalised nouns such as titles, months, gods, planets etc\)

**Gloss** = a meaning in one word or as few as possible \(by Tyndale scholars\)

**Meaning** = lexical entry. The Brief lexicon uses Abbot-Smith or MiddleLiddel. The LJS lexicon uses the Full LSJ formatted by Tyndale House, Cambridge. Those without attribution have been added by STEPBible. 

**\(AS\)** = Abbott Smith - from https://github.com/translatable-exegetical-tools/Abbott-Smith, with corrections and adapted by Tyndale Scholars. 

**\(ML\)** = Middle Liddell - from Perseus - used for Meaning in the Brief lexicon when there is no entry by \(AS\)

Full LSJ - Liddell-Scott-Jones -  from Perseus, with additional features and corrections by Tyndale House, Cambridge:
- most abbreviations have been expanded, usually in accordance with the introductions to the lexicons but occasionally made clearer. 
- dates have been added to authors by Tyndale House, using standard reference works. 
- coding is added to hide bibliographic data under a link stating the earliest date included in that data. \(Note, not all devices work well with tooltips, so consider implementing a clickable option such as http://jsfiddle.net/xaAN3/\)
