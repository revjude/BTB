**1.** the living chariot of the theophanic God; possibly identified with the storm-wind [[Ps.18.11|Ps 18:11]] = [[2Sam.22.11|2Sam 22:11]] <span class="bdbLangHebrew">‎וַיִּדְכַּב עַלכְּֿרוּב‎</span> ***and he rode upon a cherub*** (\|\| flew swiftly on the wings of the wind).


**2.** as the guards of the garden of Eden [[Gen.3.24|Gen 3:24]] ([[BDB#J|J]]).


**3.** as the throne of Yahweh Sabaoth, in phrase <span class="bdbLangHebrew">‎(צְבָאוֺת) ישֵׁב הַכְּרוּבִים‎</span> <span class="bdbLangHebrew">‎׳‎</span><span class="bdbLangHebrew">‎י‎</span> ***Yahweh Sabaoth throned on the cherubim*** [[1Sam.4.4|1Sam 4:4]]; [[2Sam.6.2|2Sam 6:2]] = [[1Chr.13.6|1Chr 13:6]] the context shews that the cherubim of the ark of the covenant are referred to, and it is probable that the same reference to, and it is probable that the same reference is in [[2Kgs.19.15|2Kgs 19:15]] = [[Isa.37.16|Isa 37:16]]; [[Ps.80.2|Ps 80:2]]; [[Ps.99.1|Ps 99:1]]. 

**4.** P gives an account of: 
$\quad$ $\quad$ **a.** two cherubim of solid gold upon the slab of gold of the <span class="bdbLangHebrew">‎כַּפֹּרֶת‎</span> facing each other with wings outstretched above, so as to constitute a basis or throne on which the glory of Yahweh appeared, and from whence He spake <ref ref="Exod 25:18-22" b="2" cBegin="25" vBegin="18" cEnd="25" vEnd="22" onclick="bcv(2,25,18)">Exod 25:18-22</ref>; <ref ref="Exod 37:7-9" b="2" cBegin="37" vBegin="7" cEnd="37" vEnd="9" onclick="bcv(2,37,7)">Exod 37:7-9</ref>; [[Num.7.89|Num 7:89]] 
$\quad$ $\quad$ **b.** numerous cherubim woven into the texture of the inner curtains of the tabernacle and the veils [[Exod.26.1|Exod 26:1]]; [[Exod.26.31|Exod 26:31]]; [[Exod.36.8|Exod 36:8]]; [[Exod.36.35|Exod 36:35]] 

**5.** Kings and Chronicles describe ==the cherubim of the temple==: 
$\quad$ $\quad$ **a.** two gigantic images of olive wood plated with gold, ten cubits high, standing in the <span class="bdbLangHebrew">‎דְּבִיר‎</span> facing the door, whose wings five cubits each, extended, two of them meeting in the middle of the room to constitute the throne, two of them extending to the walls [[1Kgs.6.23|1Kgs 6:23]]-28; [[1Kgs.8.6|1Kgs 8:6]];  [[2Chr.3.10|2Chr 3:10]]-13; [[2Chr.5.7|2Chr 5:7]];  Chronicles (doubtless influenced by Ezekiel) represents them as the chariot of Yahweh [[1Chr.28.18|1Chr 28:18]] 
$\quad$ $\quad$ **b.** images of cherubim were carved on the gold plated cedar planks which constituted the inner walls of the temple, and upon the olive wood doors [[1Kgs.6.29|1Kgs 6:29]]-35 [[2Chr.3.7|2Chr 3:7]] and on the bases of the portable lavers, interchanging with lions and oxen [[1Kgs.7.29|1Kgs 7:29]]-36; Chronicles also represents that they were woven in the veil of the <span class="bdbLangHebrew">‎דְּבִיר‎</span> [[2Chr.3.14|2Chr 3:14]]. 

**6.** Ezekiel describes the cherubim: 
$\quad$ $\quad$ **a.** as four living creatures, each with four faces, lion, ox, eagle, and man, having the figure and hands of men, and the feet of calves. Each has four wings, two of which are stretched upward, meeting above and sustaining the throne of Yahweh; two of them stretched downwards so as to cover the creatures themselves. The cherubim never turn but go straight forward, as do the wheels of the cherubic chariot, and they are full of eyes and are like burning coals of fire, [[Ezek.1.5|Ezek 1:5]]-28; [[Ezek.9.3|Ezek 9:3]]; [[Ezek.10.1|Ezek 10:1]];  [[Ezek.11.22|Ezek 11:22]] the king of Tyre is scornfully compared with one of these, and is assigned a residence in Eden and the mountain of God [[Ezek.28.14|Ezek 28:14]]-16; 
$\quad$ $\quad$ **b.** Ezekiel knows of no cherubic statues in the new temple, but represents the inner walls of the temple as carved with alternating palm trees and cherubim, each with two faces, the lion looking on one side, the man on the other. It is evident that the number and the form of the cherubim vary in the representations (compare <ref ref="Ezek 41:18-25" b="26" cBegin="41" vBegin="18" cEnd="41" vEnd="25" onclick="bcv(26,41,18)">Ezek 41:18-25</ref>). It is probable that the <span class="bdbLangHebrew">‎שְׂרָפִים‎</span> of [[Isa.6.2|Isa 6:2]]-6 are another form of the cherubim. The Apocalypse of the seals Rev 4-6 combines them in four <span class="bdbLangGreek">ζῷα.</span>
