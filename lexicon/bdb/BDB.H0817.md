 <span class="bdbLangHebrew">‎אָשָׁם‎</span> **noun masculine** ==offence, guilt== — <span class="bdbLangHebrew">‎׳‎</span><span class="bdbLangHebrew">‎א‎</span> [[Gen.26.10|Gen 26:10]] + 37 t., suffix <span class="bdbLangHebrew">‎אֲשָׁמוֺ‎</span> [[Num.5.7|Num 5:7]] + 7 t.; — 

**1.** ***offence, trespass, fault*** [[Ps.68.22|Ps 68:22]] (***guiltiness*** [[BDB#RV|RV]]). 

**2.** ***guilt*** [[Gen.26.10|Gen 26:10]] ([[BDB#J|J]]) [[Prov.14.9|Prov 14:9]]; [[Jer.51.5|Jer 51:5]]. 

**3.** ***compensation***, <span class="bdbLangHebrew">‎לְהָשִׁיב הָאָשָׁם אֵלָיו‎</span> ***to whom to return the compensation*** (or satisfaction for injury) [[Num.5.7|Num 5:7]]; [[Num.5.8|Num 5:8]] ([[BDB#P|P]]; ***restitution for guilt*** [[BDB#RV|RV]]). 

**4.** ***trespass-offering*** ([[BDB#AV|AV]], but ***guilt-offering*** [[BDB#RV|RV]]) used only in [[Lev.5|Lev 5]]; [[Lev.6.10|Lev 6:10]]; [[Lev.7.1|Lev 7:1]]; [[Lev.14.1|Lev 14:1]]; [[Lev.19.21|Lev 19:21]]; [[Lev.19.22|Lev 19:22]];  [[Lev.6.12|Lev 6:12]]; [[Lev.18.9|Lev 18:9]] ([[BDB#P|P]]), &amp; [[Ezek.40.39|Ezek 40:39]]; [[Ezek.42.13|Ezek 42:13]]; [[Ezek.44.29|Ezek 44:29]]; [[Ezek.46.20|Ezek 46:20]], compare [[Ezra.10.19|Ezra 10:19]]. This offering seems to have been confined to offences against God or man that could be estimated and so covered by compensation. The ordinary trespass-offering was a ram, together with restitution and a penalty of a fifth of its value. The trespass-offerings of the leper and Nazirite were he-lambs [[Lev.14|Lev 14]]; [[Num.6.12|Num 6:12]] if the person who suffered wrong or his kinsmen were not living the fine went to the priests. The victims were offered, the blood and fat pieces going to the altar, the skin and flesh to the priests. There seems to have been no application of the blood to the horns of the altar (the chief ceremony of the sin-offering) because the guilt was not expiated at the altar but by compensation to the wronged person or his representative. A part of the blood of the leper's trespass-offering was applied to his person to consecrate him (as in the case of the ram of consecration to consecrate the priests [[Lev.8.23|Lev 8:23]]). The trespass-offering is unknown to [[BDB#J|J]] [[BDB#E|E]] [[BDB#D|D]] and the older Hebrew literature. However, the Philistines send an <span class="bdbLangHebrew">‎אשׁם‎</span> of golden mice and tumours [[1Sam.6.3|1Sam 6:3]]; [[1Sam.6.4|1Sam 6:4]]; [[1Sam.6.8|1Sam 6:8]]; [[1Sam.6.17|1Sam 6:17]], and an <span class="bdbLangHebrew">‎אשׁם‎</span> of money was given to the priests [[2Kgs.12.17|2Kgs 12:17]], but these are entirely different from the trespass-offering of [[BDB#P|P]]. The Messianic servant offers himself as an <span class="bdbLangHebrew">‎אשׁם‎</span> in compensation for the sins of the people, interposing for them as their substitute [[Isa.53.10|Isa 53:10]] (incorrectly, ***sin-offering*** [[BDB#AV|AV]] [[BDB#RV|RV]]). See further [[BDB#Oehl|Oehler]]<sup>OT Theol. § 137</sup> [[BDB#Di|Di]] [[Lev.5.14|Lev 5:14]].
