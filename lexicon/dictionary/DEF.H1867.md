$\quad$ Darius.
- § Darius = *"lord"*
- ***Darejavesh***, a title (rather than name) of several Persian kings

**1)** Darius the Mede, the son of Ahasuerus, king of the Chaldeans, who succeeded to the Babylonian kingdom on the death of Belshazzar; probably the same as "Astyages" the last king of the Medes (538 BC)
**2)** Darius, the son of Hystaspes, the founder of the Perso-Arian dynasty (521 BC)
**3)** Darius II or Darius III
$\quad$ **3a)** Darius II, Nothus (Ochus) was king of Persia during the time of Nehemiah (424/3-405/4 BC). Darius II is the most probable because he is mentioned by Nehemiah and ruled during the time of Nehemiah
$\quad$ **3b)** Darius III, Codomannus was king of Persia during its last years at the time of Alexander the Great and was his opponent (336-330 BC)
