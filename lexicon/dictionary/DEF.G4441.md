$\quad$ ask, demand, enquire, understand.
- to question, i.e. ascertain by inquiry (as a matter of information merely
-  and thus differing from **<big>[[G2065|‎ἐρωτάω‎]]</big>**, which properly means a request as a favor
-  and from **<big>[[G0154|‎αἰτέω‎]]</big>**, which is strictly a demand for something due
-  as well as from **<big>[[G2212|‎ζητέω‎]]</big>**, which implies a search for something hidden
-  and from **<big>[[G1189|‎δέομαι‎]]</big>**, which involves the idea of urgent need)
-  by implication, to learn (by casual intelligence)
