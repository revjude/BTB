- to place (in the widest application, literally and figuratively
-  properly, in a passive or horizontal posture, and thus different from **<big>[[G2476|‎ἵστημι‎]]</big>**, which properly denotes an upright and active position, while **<big>[[G2749|‎κεῖμαι‎]]</big>** is properly reflexive and utterly  prostrate)
