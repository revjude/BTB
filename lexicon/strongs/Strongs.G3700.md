$\quad$ appear, look, see, shew self.
- to gaze (i.e. with wide-open eyes, as at something remarkable
-  and thus differing from <span class="asgreek">βλέπω</span><sup><small>[[G0991]]</small></sup>, which denotes simply voluntary observation
-  and from <span class="asgreek">εἴδω</span><sup><small>[[G1492]]</small></sup>, which expresses merely mechanical, passive or casual vision
-  while <span class="asgreek">θεάομαι</span><sup><small>[[G2300]]</small></sup>, and still more emphatically its intensive <span class="asgreek">θεωρέω</span><sup><small>[[G2334]]</small></sup>, signifies an earnest but more continued inspection
-  and <span class="asgreek">σκοπέω</span><sup><small>[[G4648]]</small></sup> a watching from a distance)
