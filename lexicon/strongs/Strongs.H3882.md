$\quad$ leviathan, mourning.
- ***a wreathed animal***, i.e. ***a serpent*** (especially the crocodile or some other large sea-monster)
-  figuratively, the constellation of the ***dragon***
-  also as a symbol of ***Babylon***

**1)** leviathan, sea monster, dragon
$\quad$ **1a)** large aquatic animal
$\quad$ **1b)** perhaps the extinct dinosaur, plesiosaurus, exact meaning unknown
++++
Some think this to be a crocodile but from the description in Job 41:1-34 this is patently absurd. It appears to ba a large fire breathing animal of some sort. Just as the bomardier beetle has an explosion producing mechanism, so the great sea dragon may have an explosive producing mechanism to enable it to be a real fire breathing dragon.
