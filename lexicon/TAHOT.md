TAHOT - Translators Amalgamated Hebrew OT - STEPBible.org CC BY

This data is based on the exact Leningrad codex. Divergences from other important Hebrew manuscripts are recorded as variants. (see the list of abbreviations below). Each verse is displayed as word-per-line and also in  interlinear format. 

This data aims to represents the text actually used by Bible translators, which is occasionally is different to that found in the Leningrad codex. Therefore this text deviates from Leningrad when it:

1) Follows the Qere, 
2) Restores missing text and 
3) Adds words preserved in the LXX if they are used by translators.

The Qere ('spoken') is the scribal marginal corrections which are generally followed by the KJV and all subsequent translators. The Ketiv (i.e. the text that  the Qere replaces) is recorded as a variant.  These are recorded as "**Q**" & "**K**", with "**L**" recording the actual text of Leningrad which consists of the letters of **K** with the pointing of **Q**																

The Qere recorded here are all those in the Leningrad codex plus some from others manuscripts that are listed in the BHS apparatus

Restoration of text is necessary at [[Josh.21.36]]-[[Josh.21.37|37]] & [[Neh.7.67|Neh.7.67b]] because these are missing in the Leningrad codex. They are restored from the text of [[1Chr.6.63]]-[[1Chr.6.64|64]] and [[Ezra.2.66]]. They are marked as "**R**". 

Additional words or phrases preserved in the LXX are converted back to Hebrew as in the apparatus of BHS & BHK. These are marked as "X". They occur at [[Gen.4.8]]; [[Num.26.40]]; [[Deut.30.16]]; [[Judg.16.13]],[[Judg.16.14|14]]; [[1Sam.10.1]]; [[1Sam.13.1|13.1]]; [[1Sam.13.15|13.15]]; [[1Sam.14.41]]; [[2Sam.12.16]]; [[2Sam.13.34|13.34]]; [[2Sam.15.8]]; [[2Sam.23.33|23.33]]; [[2Sam.24.17]]; [[2Kgs.25.3]]; [[1Chr.4.13]]; [[1Chr.6.27|6.27]]; [[1Chr.6.28]],[[1Chr.6.59|59]]; [[1Chr.6.60]],[[1Chr.6.77]]; [[1Chr.7.25]]; [[1Chr.8.29|8.29]]; [[1Chr.8.30]]; [[1Chr.9.41|9.41]]; [[1Chr.21.17]]; [[1Chr.25.9|25.9]]; [[2Chr.15.8]]; [[Ezra.8.5]],[[Ezra.8.10|10]]; [[Esth.3.7]]; [[Ps.25.21]]; [[Ps.56.7|56.7]]; [[Ps.145.13]]; [[Eccl.9.2]];
