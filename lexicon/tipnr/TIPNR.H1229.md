Bakbukiah was a Levite who served in various roles in Jerusalem after the return from Babylonian exile. In [[Neh.11.17|Nehemiah 11:17]], he is described as the second among his brothers and one who gave thanks in prayer. This suggests he had a leadership role in worship. In [[Neh.12.9|Nehemiah 12:9]], Bakbukiah is listed along with other Levites who had responsibilities over the thanksgiving choirs. Later, in [[Neh.12.25|Nehemiah 12:25]], he is mentioned as one of the gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms at the gates. These references indicate that Bakbukiah was a prominent Levite who held multiple positions related to temple service and worship in the post-exilic community.
