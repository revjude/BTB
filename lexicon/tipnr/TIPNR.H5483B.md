The Horse Gate was one of the gates in the wall of Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah \([[Neh.3.28|Nehemiah 3:28]]\). It was located in the eastern part of the city, near the temple area. The gate's name suggests that it may have been used for horses to enter and exit the city, possibly in connection with the king's stables. In Nehemiah's account of rebuilding the wall, the priests made repairs to the wall near the Horse Gate, indicating its proximity to the temple. The Horse Gate is also mentioned in [[Jer.31.40|Jeremiah 31:40]] as a landmark describing the future expansion and consecration of Jerusalem.
