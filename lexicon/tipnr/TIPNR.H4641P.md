Maaseiah was an Israelite who participated in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's wall during the time of Nehemiah \([[Neh.3.23|Neh.3.23]]\). After the return of the Jewish exiles from Babylon, Nehemiah led the effort to reconstruct the city's walls and gates \(Neh.1-7\). Maaseiah is mentioned as one of the individuals who repaired a section of the wall near his house, working alongside Baruch the son of Zabbai \([[Neh.3.23|Neh.3.23]]\). The rebuilding of the wall was a significant event in the restoration of Jerusalem and the reestablishment of the Jewish community in the post-exilic period. The participation of Maaseiah and others in this project demonstrates their commitment to the physical and spiritual renewal of their homeland.
