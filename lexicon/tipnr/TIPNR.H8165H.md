Mount Seir, mentioned in [[Josh.15.10|Joshua 15:10]], is a landmark on the boundary of the tribe of Judah, located near Kiriath-jearim and Chesalon. This Mount Seir is distinct from the more well-known Mount Seir in Edom, which is associated with Esau and his descendants. The name "Seir" means "shaggy" or "wooded," suggesting that this mountain was likely a wooded height. Its exact location is uncertain, but it may be part of the range that runs northeast from Saris by Karyat el-'Anab and Biddu to the plateau of el-Jib. Traces of an ancient forest can still be seen in this area.
