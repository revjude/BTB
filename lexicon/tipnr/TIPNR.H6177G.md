Aroer was a city located in the territory allotted to the tribe of Gad, east of the Jordan River. According to [[Num.32.34|Numbers 32:34]], the Gadites built Aroer, along with other cities in the region, after the conquest of the land under Moses' leadership. 

Aroer is mentioned in [[Josh.13.25|Joshua 13:25]] as part of the description of Gad's territory, situated near the border with the Ammonites. The city is also noted in the account of Jephthah's victory over the Ammonites, where he is said to have struck them from Aroer to Minnith \([[Judg.11.33|Judges 11:33]]\). 

During King David's reign, Aroer is mentioned in the context of the census he conducted, which began at Aroer and continued throughout the regions east of the Jordan \([[2Sam.24.5|2 Samuel 24:5]]\). The city was also the hometown of Shamgar, one of David's mighty men \([[1Chr.11.44|1 Chronicles 11:44]]\). 

The prophet Isaiah mentions Aroer in his prophecy concerning Damascus, stating that the cities of Aroer will be forsaken \([[Isa.17.2|Isaiah 17:2]]\). This suggests that Aroer, along with other cities in the region, would face judgment and desolation. 

Aroer's significance in the Bible lies in its association with the tribe of Gad and its location in the Transjordan region. The city's mention in various contexts, from the initial settlement of the land to the reigns of David and the prophetic messages, highlights its enduring presence throughout Israel's history.
