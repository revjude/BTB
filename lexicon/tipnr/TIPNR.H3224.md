Jemimah is mentioned in the book of Job as one of the three daughters born to him after God restored his fortunes. She was the first daughter, followed by Keziah and Keren-happuch. The name Jemimah means "dove" or "warm," possibly signifying the peace and comfort that came to Job's life after his trials. The Bible notes that Job's daughters were the most beautiful women in all the land, and he granted them an inheritance along with their brothers, which was unusual in that culture. Jemimah's presence in the story emphasizes the completeness of Job's restoration and the blessings he received after his period of suffering.
