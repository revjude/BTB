Genesis 19:30-38 recounts the story of Lot's two unnamed daughters after the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The elder daughter, believing that they were the only survivors and that there were no men to father their children, devised a plan to sleep with their father. She got Lot drunk and lay with him, conceiving a son named Moab. Moab became the ancestor of the Moabite people. The Bible does not provide further details about the elder daughter's life or character, but her actions reflect the desperation and moral decay of the time.
