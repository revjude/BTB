Ashkenaz is mentioned in the genealogies of Genesis 10 and 1 Chronicles 1, known as the Table of Nations. He was a son of Gomer and grandson of Japheth, one of the three sons of Noah. The Table of Nations records the spreading out of Noah's descendants after the flood, indicating the origins of various people groups. Ashkenaz and his brothers, Riphath and Togarmah, are associated with the peoples who settled in the region of Asia Minor and the Black Sea. Some scholars have connected the name Ashkenaz with the Scythians, a nomadic people who lived in the area north of the Black Sea.
