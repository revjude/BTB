Mishael was a Levite who lived during the time of Ezra and Nehemiah. He is mentioned in [[Neh.8.4|Nehemiah 8:4]] as one of the Levites who stood beside Ezra on a high wooden platform when Ezra read the Book of the Law to the assembled people of Israel. This significant event took place after the Israelites had returned from Babylonian exile and were reestablishing their community and religious practices in Jerusalem. 

Mishael's presence alongside Ezra during this important public reading of the Law highlights his role as a Levite and his involvement in the religious life of the community. The Levites were responsible for assisting the priests and teaching the people about God's laws and commandments. By standing with Ezra, Mishael demonstrated his support for the restoration of the Torah as the central guide for the nation's life and faith.
