Gatam is mentioned in [[Gen.36.11|Genesis 36:11]], 16, and [[1Chr.1.36|1 Chronicles 1:36]] as one of the sons of Eliphaz and a grandson of Esau. Esau, also known as Edom, was the twin brother of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and the ancestor of the Edomites \(Genesis 25:30; 36:1\). Gatam is listed among the chiefs of Edom, indicating that he held a position of authority and leadership within the Edomite tribal structure \([[Gen.36.16|Genesis 36:16]]\). The Edomites were the descendants of Esau who settled in the region of Seir, south of the Dead Sea \(Genesis 36:8-9\). They became a significant political and military power in the region, often in conflict with the Israelites \(Numbers 20:14-21; 1 Samuel 14:47; 2 Samuel 8:13-14\). The mention of Gatam and the other chiefs of Edom in the genealogical records emphasizes the importance of family lineage and tribal organization in the ancient Near East.
