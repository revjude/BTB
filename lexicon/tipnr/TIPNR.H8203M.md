<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Shephatiah</span>, whose descendants were among Solomon's servants who returned to Jerusalem from Babylon.
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.57|Ezr.2.57]]; 
- only referred to as Shephatiah<[[H8203M]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ש</span>ְׁ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>פ</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ט</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>הו</span>ּ\).

Shephatiah is mentioned in [[Ezra.2.57|Ezra 2:57]] and [[Neh.7.59|Nehemiah 7:59]] as an ancestor of some of Solomon's servants who returned to Jerusalem from the Babylonian exile. The descendants of these servants are listed among the people who came back to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own town. The presence of Shephatiah's descendants among Solomon's servants suggests that his family line had been employed in the service of the royal household during the time of King Solomon and continued this role even after the exile.
