There are two places named Ophrah mentioned in the Bible: 

Ophrah of Benjamin: This Ophrah was a town located in the territory of Benjamin \(Josh. 18:23\). It is listed among the towns allotted to the tribe during the division of the Promised Land. No further details about this Ophrah are provided in the Bible. 

Ophrah of Manasseh: This Ophrah was a place associated with Gideon, one of the judges of Israel. It was the hometown of Gideon and the site where he built an altar to the Lord and destroyed the altar of Baal \(Judg. 6:11, 24\). Gideon's son, Abimelech, was born in Ophrah \(Judg. 8:31\). The Philistines raided Ophrah during the time of Saul \(1 Sam. 13:17\). The prophet Micah mentions an Ophrah in his prophecy, possibly referring to this location, using the name Beth-le-aphrah \(Mic. 1:10\). The exact location of this Ophrah is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the region of Manasseh, west of the Jordan River.
