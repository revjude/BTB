Maacah was the sister of Huppim and Shuppim, who were descendants of Benjamin \([[1Chr.7.15|1Ch.7.15]]\). She married Machir, the son of Manasseh, and gave birth to two sons, Peresh and Sheresh \([[1Chr.7.16|1Ch.7.16]]\). Machir was known for being the father of Gilead, a region east of the Jordan River \(Num.26.29; 1Ch.7.14\). The marriage of Maacah to Machir represents an intermarriage between the tribes of Benjamin and Manasseh. No further details are provided about Maacah or her sons in the biblical narrative. Her mention in the genealogy underscores the interconnectedness of the Israelite tribes and the significance of marriage alliances in the early history of Israel.
