The mighty warriors, also known as David's "mighty men" or "heroes," were an elite group of soldiers who played a crucial role in establishing and maintaining David's kingdom. They were known for their bravery, strength, and military prowess, often accomplishing remarkable feats in battle. 

Naarai's inclusion in this list indicates that he was recognized for his exceptional abilities as a warrior and his dedication to serving King David.
