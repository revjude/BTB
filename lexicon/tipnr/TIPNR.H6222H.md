Asaiah was a leader from the tribe of Simeon during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. He is mentioned in a genealogy of Simeon in 1 Chronicles 4. The passage describes how some of the Simeonites, including Asaiah, sought new pasture lands for their flocks and migrated to Gedor, where they found rich, good pasture. They also destroyed the Hamites and Meunites who lived there and settled in their place. Asaiah's mention as a leader suggests he played a significant role in this expansion of Simeonite territory.
