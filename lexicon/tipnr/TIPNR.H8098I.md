He is mentioned in [[1Chr.26.4|1 Chronicles 26:4]],6-7 as one of the sons of Obed-Edom, a Gittite who was blessed by God for housing the ark of the covenant \(2 Samuel 6:11\). Shemaiah had brothers who were able men with strength for the service, totaling 62 from the family of Obed-Edom \(1 Chronicles 26:8\). Among Shemaiah's sons were Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad, along with their brothers Elihu and Semachiah, who are described as able men. As gatekeepers, Shemaiah and his family would have been responsible for guarding the entrances to the temple and maintaining order within its precincts.
