Hali was a town mentioned in the list of cities and towns allotted to the tribe of Asher during the division of the Promised Land. It is listed along with other towns such as Helkath, Beten, and Achshaph \([[Josh.19.25|Joshua 19:25]]\). The territory of Asher was located in the western part of the Galilee region, bordering the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali to the east. Apart from this single mention in the book of Joshua, no further information about Hali is provided in the Bible. Its exact location and history remain uncertain, as the town is not mentioned in any other biblical accounts or in known extra-biblical sources. The inclusion of Hali in the list of Asher's towns suggests that it was a settlement of some significance during the time of Joshua and the initial allocation of the land to the Israelite tribes. However, due to the limited information available, the specific details about Hali's size, population, or role in the region cannot be determined with certainty.
