- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Gal.2.14|Act.5.37]]; 
- only referred to as Judas **<big>[[G2455|Ἰούδας]]</big>**.

Judas, also known as Judas the Galilean, is mentioned in Acts 5:37 as a Jewish rebel leader who led a revolt against the Roman census. The context of the passage is Gamaliel's speech to the Sanhedrin, where he advises caution in dealing with the apostles and their teaching \(Acts 5:34-39\). 

According to Gamaliel, Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away some people after him. This census likely refers to the one conducted by Quirinius, the governor of Syria, around 6-7 AD \(Luke 2:2\).
