- only referred to as Jebusites<[[H2983G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>בו</span>ּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ס</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>\); 
- descended from Canaan<[[H3667G]]> along with Sidon<[[H6721G]]>, Heth<[[H2845]]>, Amorites<[[H0567]]>, Girgashites<[[H1622]]>, Hivites<[[H2340]]>, Arkites<[[H6208]]>, Sinites<[[H5513]]>, Arvadites<[[H0721]]>, Zemarites<[[H6786]]> and Hamathites<[[H2577]]>.

The Jebusites were one of the Canaanite tribes that inhabited the land promised to the Israelites by God. They are first mentioned in [[Gen.10.16|Genesis 10:16]] and 15:21 as descendants of Canaan, the grandson of Noah. When the Israelites left Egypt, God promised to drive out the Jebusites and other Canaanite tribes from the land \([[Exod.3.8|Exodus 3:8]], 17; 13:5; 23:23; 33:2; 34:11\). During the conquest of Canaan under Joshua, the Jebusites were among the tribes that the Israelites were commanded to utterly destroy \(Deuteronomy 7:1; 20:17\). However, the Jebusites proved to be formidable opponents, and the Israelites were unable to completely drive them out of Jerusalem \(Joshua 15:63; Judges 1:21\). The Jebusites continued to live among the Israelites during the time of the judges \([[Judg.3.5|Judges 3:5]]; 19:11\). It was not until the reign of King David that the Jebusites were finally defeated, and Jerusalem was captured and made the capital of Israel \([[2Sam.5.6|2 Samuel 5:6]]-8; [[1Chr.11.4|1 Chronicles 11:4]]-6\). After their defeat, some Jebusites remained in the land and were subjected to forced labor by Solomon \([[1Kgs.9.20|1 Kings 9:20]]; [[2Chr.8.7|2 Chronicles 8:7]]\). The site where the temple was built, Mount Moriah, was purchased by David from Araunah the Jebusite \([[2Sam.24.16|2 Samuel 24:16]]-18; [[1Chr.21.15|1 Chronicles 21:15]]-28; [[2Chr.3.1|2 Chronicles 3:1]]\). The Jebusites are mentioned among the foreign peoples with whom the Israelites intermarried, contrary to God's command \([[Ezra.9.1|Ezra 9:1]]\). In [[Zech.9.7|Zechariah 9:7]], there is a prophetic promise that the Jebusites will be incorporated into God's people, symbolizing the inclusion of Gentiles in the future messianic kingdom.
