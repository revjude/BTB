Zimmah was a Levite who lived during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. He was a descendant of Asaph, one of the principal musicians appointed by David to lead worship in the temple. In 2 Chronicles 29, Zimmah is mentioned as one of the Levites who participated in the purification and rededication of the temple, which had been neglected during the reign of the previous king, Ahaz. Hezekiah initiated a series of religious reforms, including the cleansing of the temple and the restoration of proper worship practices. Zimmah, along with other Levites from the families of Kohath and Merari, played a role in this important process of spiritual renewal. The participation of the Levites in the temple purification demonstrates their continued significance in maintaining the religious life of Judah, even during times of religious decline.
