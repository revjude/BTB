Zemaraim refers to two distinct places in the Bible. One is a town in the territory of Benjamin, listed among the cities allotted to that tribe during the division of the Promised Land under Joshua \([[Josh.18.22|Jos.18.22]]\). Its exact location is unknown. The other is Mount Zemaraim, a hill located in the hill country of Ephraim \([[2Chr.13.4|2Ch.13.4]]\). It was here that King Abijah of Judah stood to address the army of Jeroboam I of Israel before a battle. In his speech, Abijah denounced Jeroboam's rebellion against the house of David and called on Israel to not fight against the Lord. Abijah and Judah prevailed in the battle that followed.
