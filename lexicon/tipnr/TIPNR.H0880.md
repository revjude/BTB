Beerah is mentioned in [[1Chr.5.6|1 Chronicles 5:6]] as a leader from the tribe of Reuben who was taken into exile by Tiglath-Pileser, the king of Assyria. The context of the passage is the genealogy and history of the tribe of Reuben, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. Beerah is described as the son of Baal, indicating his lineage within the tribe. The Assyrian conquest and deportation of the Reubenites, along with the tribes of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, occurred during the reign of Tiglath-Pileser \(also known as Pul\) in the 8th century BC. This event marked the beginning of the exile and dispersion of the northern tribes of Israel. The mention of Beerah's exile highlights the political and spiritual challenges faced by the Israelites during this period and the consequences of their disobedience to God.
