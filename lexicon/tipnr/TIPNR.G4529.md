Salamis was a city located on the eastern coast of the island of Cyprus. It was one of the first places visited by Paul and Barnabas during their missionary journey, as recorded in the book of Acts. After being sent out by the church in Antioch, they arrived in Salamis and proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues \(Acts 13:4-5\). Salamis was a significant port city and a center of commerce, with a sizeable Jewish population. The city was destroyed by an earthquake in the 4th century AD and was later rebuilt as Constantia. Today, the ruins of ancient Salamis can be found near the modern city of Famagusta, in the Turkish-controlled part of Cyprus.
