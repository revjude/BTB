The Bible does not directly name the husband of Zeruiah, who was the sister of King David. However, [[1Sam.26.6|1 Samuel 26:6]] mentions Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, suggesting that she was married and had children. 2 Samuel 2:18 also mentions Joab and Asahel as sons of Zeruiah. The fact that Zeruiah's sons are consistently referred to as "sons of Zeruiah" rather than by their father's name suggests that he may have died before they rose to prominence or that Zeruiah herself was a notable figure. Although the Bible does not provide further details about Zeruiah's husband, his marriage to David's sister and the military prowess of his sons indicate that he was likely a member of a prominent family in Judah.
