Zorah was a town located in the Shephelah, the foothills between the coastal plain and the hill country of Judah. It was originally allotted to the tribe of Judah \([[Josh.15.33|Jos.15.33]]\) but later became part of the territory of Dan \([[Josh.19.41|Jos.19.41]]\). Zorah was the hometown of Samson, the judge of Israel \([[Judg.13.2|Jdg.13.2]]\). The Spirit of the Lord began to stir Samson in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol \([[Judg.13.2|Jdg.13.2]]5\). Men from Zorah and Eshtaol were involved in the Danite migration \([[Judg.18.2|Jdg.18.2]],8,11\). Samson was buried between Zorah and Eshtaol \([[Judg.16.31|Jdg.16.31]]\). During the reign of Rehoboam, Zorah was fortified as a defensive city \([[2Chr.11.10|2Ch.11.10]]\). In the time of Nehemiah, the people of Zorah helped rebuild Jerusalem \([[Neh.11.29|Neh.11.29]]\). Zorah is identified with the modern-day village of Sar'a, about 15 miles west of Jerusalem.
