Rimmon was a Beerothite, from the town of Beeroth, which was located in the territory of Benjamin \([[2Sam.4.2|2 Samuel 4:2]]\). He was the father of Rechab and Baanah, two of Ish-bosheth's captains \([[2Sam.4.2|2 Samuel 4:2]], 5\). After the death of King Saul and his sons, Ish-bosheth, Saul's surviving son, was made king over Israel \(2 Samuel 2:8-10\). However, his reign was short-lived, as Rechab and Baanah, seeking to gain favor with David, murdered Ish-bosheth while he was resting in his bed \([[2Sam.4.5|2 Samuel 4:5]]-7\). They brought Ish-bosheth's head to David, believing that he would reward them for eliminating his rival \(2 Samuel 4:8\). However, David condemned their actions and ordered their execution, as they had killed an innocent man in his own house \([[2Sam.4.9|2 Samuel 4:9]]-12\). The mention of Rimmon as the father of Rechab and Baanah provides background information on the assassins and their family origin. The treacherous act committed by Rimmon's sons led to the end of Ish-bosheth's reign and solidified David's position as king over all Israel \(2 Samuel 5:1-3\).
