- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.6.10|Neh.6.10]]; 
- only referred to as Delaiah **<big>[[H1806|דְּלָיָה]]</big>**; 
- a son of Mehetabel **<big>[[H4105|מְהֵיטַבְאֵל]]</big>**; 
-  father of Shemaiah **<big>[[H8098|שְׁמַעְיָה]]</big>**.

Delaiah is mentioned in [[Neh.6.10|Nehemiah 6:10]] as the father of Shemaiah, a man who tried to deceive Nehemiah during the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem. Nehemiah's enemies, Sanballat and Tobiah, had hired Shemaiah to trick Nehemiah into hiding in the temple, claiming that there was a plot to kill him. 

Shemaiah invited Nehemiah to meet with him at the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was confined to his home. The fact that Shemaiah was confined to his home suggests that he may have been a prophet or a man of some religious significance. 

However, Nehemiah perceived that Shemaiah's prophecy was not from God and that he had been hired by Nehemiah's enemies to intimidate him and cause him to sin by entering the temple, which was forbidden for someone in Nehemiah's position \(Nehemiah 6:11-13\). 

The mention of Delaiah in this context serves to identify Shemaiah and to highlight the opposition and deception Nehemiah faced while rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem. It also demonstrates Nehemiah's discernment and faith in God, which enabled him to resist the schemes of his enemies and complete the work of rebuilding the city's defenses.
