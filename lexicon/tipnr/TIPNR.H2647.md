- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.24.13|1Ch.24.13]]; 
- only referred to as Huppah **<big>[[H2647|חֻפָּה]]</big>**.

Huppah is mentioned in [[1Chr.24.13|1 Chronicles 24:13]] as one of the priests who were assigned divisions of service in the temple during the reign of King David. He was the head of the thirteenth division of priestly service. 

In 1 Chronicles 24, David, along with Zadok and Ahimelech, organized the priests into twenty-four divisions for their service in the temple. This organization was done to ensure a systematic and orderly approach to the priestly duties, which included offering sacrifices, maintaining the temple, and teaching the law to the people. 

Each division was assigned a specific period of service, and the order was determined by casting lots. Huppah's division was the thirteenth in the order of service. 

The organization of the priestly divisions by David was a significant step in establishing a structured and efficient system for the temple service. It also ensured that all the priestly families had an opportunity to serve in the temple and that the responsibilities were evenly distributed among them. 

Apart from being mentioned in this context, no other information is provided about Huppah in the Bible. His inclusion in the list of priestly divisions highlights the importance of the priestly role in ancient Israelite worship and the efforts made by David to organize and regulate the temple service.
