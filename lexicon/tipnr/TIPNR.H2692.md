Hazar-addar was a town located on the southern border of Canaan, as described in the book of Numbers. It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Num.34.4|Numbers 34:4]], as part of the delineation of the southern boundary of the Promised Land. 

In the context of Numbers 34, God is giving Moses instructions about the boundaries of the land that the Israelites are to inherit. The southern border is described as running from the end of the Salt Sea \(the Dead Sea\) southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, passing along to Zin, and going south of Kadesh-barnea before proceeding to Hazar-addar and continuing to Azmon. 

The exact location of Hazar-addar is uncertain, as the town is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in other historical sources. Its inclusion in the boundary description suggests that it was a recognized landmark or settlement in the region during the time of Moses. 

As part of the southern border, Hazar-addar would have been situated in the arid wilderness region of the Negev, south of Canaan. The name "Hazar" is derived from the Hebrew word for "enclosure" or "settlement," indicating that it may have been a fortified town or a well-known encampment along the desert route. 

The mention of Hazar-addar in the biblical text serves to define the extent of the Promised Land and to underscore God's specific instructions to Moses regarding the territory that the Israelites were to possess. Its inclusion in the boundary description also highlights the importance of geographical accuracy and attention to detail in the recording of Israel's history and the transmission of God's commands.
