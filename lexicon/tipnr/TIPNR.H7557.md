Tiberias, also known as Rakkath in the Old Testament \(Josh. 19:35\), was a city located on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. It was founded around 20 AD by Herod Antipas, the son of Herod the Great, and named after the Roman emperor Tiberius. Tiberias served as the capital of Galilee during the time of Jesus and is mentioned in the context of the feeding of the five thousand \([[John.6.23|John 6:23]]\). After this miracle, Jesus and his disciples crossed the Sea of Galilee, and boats from Tiberias followed them. Although Tiberias is not directly mentioned in connection with Jesus' ministry, it is likely that he visited the city or passed through the region. In later centuries, Tiberias became a center of Jewish learning and the site where the Mishnah and the Jerusalem Talmud were compiled.
