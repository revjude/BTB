Serah is mentioned in [[Gen.46.17|Genesis 46:17]], [[Num.26.46|Numbers 26:46]], and [[1Chr.7.30|1 Chronicles 7:30]] as the daughter of Asher, one of the sons of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\). In the genealogies of the tribe of Asher, Serah is consistently listed alongside Asher's sons, indicating her significance within the family. The fact that Serah is mentioned by name, while other daughters are not, suggests that she may have played a notable role or had a unique story associated with her. However, the biblical text does not provide any further details about her life or the reason for her inclusion in the genealogies.
