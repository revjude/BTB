Shebuel \(or Shubael\), mentioned in [[1Chr.25.4|1 Chronicles 25:4]] and 25:20, was a Levite musician who served during the reign of King David. He was one of the sons of Heman, the king's seer, and was appointed by David to prophesy with lyres, harps, and cymbals in the temple service. Shebuel's inclusion in the list of musicians highlights the importance of music and worship in the Israelite culture and the role of the Levites in leading the people in praise and thanksgiving to God. In [[1Chr.25.4|1 Chronicles 25:4]], Shebuel is listed among the fourteen sons of Heman who were set apart for the ministry of prophesying with musical instruments. Later, in [[1Chr.25.20|1 Chronicles 25:20]], Shebuel is mentioned as the leader of the thirteenth division of musicians, responsible for serving in the temple on a rotational basis. The text does not provide any further details about Shebuel's life or specific musical abilities. However, his appointment by King David and his inclusion in the lists of musicians emphasize the significance of music in worship and the Levites' dedication to serving God through their artistic talents.
