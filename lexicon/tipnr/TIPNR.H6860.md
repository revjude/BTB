Ziklag was a city located in the Negev region of Judah, initially allotted to the tribe of Judah \([[Josh.15.31|Jos.15.31]]\) and later to Simeon \([[Josh.19.5|Jos.19.5]]; [[1Chr.4.30|1Ch.4.30]]\). The Philistine king Achish of Gath gave the city to David when he fled from King Saul \(1Sa.27:6\). David and his men lived there for over a year, making raids on the Geshurites, Girzites, and Amalekites \(1Sa.27:8-9\). While David and his men were away, the Amalekites attacked and burned Ziklag, taking captive the women and children \(1Sa.30:1-2\). David pursued them, defeated them, and recovered all that was taken \(1Sa.30:18-20\). David sent some of the spoils from this victory to his friends in Judah \([[1Sam.30.26|1Sa.30.26]]\). After Saul's death, David departed from Ziklag to go to Hebron \([[2Sam.1.1|2Sa.1.1]]\). During David's reign, some Benjamites and Manassites defected to him at Ziklag \([[1Chr.12.1|1Ch.12.1]],20\). In the time of Nehemiah, Ziklag was reinhabited by the people of Judah \([[Neh.11.28|Neh.11.28]]\). Its exact location is uncertain.
