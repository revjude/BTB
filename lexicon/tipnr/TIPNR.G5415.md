Fortunatus is mentioned in [[1Cor.16.17|1 Corinthians 16:17]] as one of the Corinthian Christians who visited Paul during his stay in Ephesus. He, along with Stephanas and Achaicus, are described as having refreshed Paul's spirit and supplying what was lacking from the Corinthian church. This suggests that they brought news, encouragement, and possibly financial support from Corinth to Paul. Their presence was a source of joy and comfort to Paul, who was facing challenges in his ministry. The mention of Fortunatus and his companions highlights the importance of fellowship and support among early Christians, even across different cities and regions.
