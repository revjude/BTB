Acco, later known as Ptolemais, was a seaport on the Mediterranean coast allotted to the tribe of Asher \([[Judg.1.31|Judges 1:31]]\). However, Asher failed to drive out the Canaanite inhabitants of Acco, so they continued to live among the Israelites. In the New Testament, the city is called Ptolemais, reflecting its Hellenistic name during the intertestamental period. The apostle Paul visited Ptolemais at the end of his third missionary journey and stayed there one day with the believers \(Acts 21:7\) before continuing on to Caesarea. Acco was an important port city throughout ancient history due to its strategic coastal location in northern Israel.
