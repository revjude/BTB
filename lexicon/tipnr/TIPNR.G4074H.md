- A woman living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Matt.8.14|Mat.8.14]]; 
- only referred to as a\_wife\_of\_Peter **<big>[[G4074|Πέτρος]]</big>**; 
-  unnamed wife of: Peter **<big>[[G4074|Πέτρος]]</big>**.

The New Testament mentions an unnamed woman who was the wife of the apostle Peter. In [[Matt.8.14|Matthew 8:14]], we learn that Jesus healed Peter's mother-in-law, who was suffering from a fever. This incident took place in Peter's house in Capernaum. The fact that Peter was married is confirmed by this passage, although no further details are given about his wife or their relationship. Her presence in the Gospel narrative highlights Jesus' compassion and power to heal, as well as the humanity of His disciples, who had families and responsibilities outside of their ministry.
