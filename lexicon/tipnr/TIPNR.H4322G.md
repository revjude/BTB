Micaiah is mentioned in the book of 2 Chronicles as one of the Levites commissioned by King Jehoshaphat to teach the Book of the Law in the cities of Judah \([[2Chr.17.7|2Ch.17.7]]\). In the third year of his reign, Jehoshaphat sent officials, Levites, and priests to instruct the people in the Law of the Lord. Micaiah is listed among the Levites who participated in this educational mission, along with Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah. This initiative demonstrates Jehoshaphat's commitment to spiritual reform and the importance of teaching God's word to the people. Micaiah's inclusion in this group suggests that he was a trusted Levite, knowledgeable in the Law, and capable of teaching others.
