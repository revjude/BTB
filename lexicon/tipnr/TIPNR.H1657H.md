Goshen was a town and region located in the hill country of Judah, in the southern part of the Promised Land. It is mentioned in the accounts of Joshua's military campaigns against the Canaanite kings. Joshua conquered the region from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza and from Goshen to Gibeon \([[Josh.10.41|Joshua 10:41]]\). The extent of Joshua's conquests is described as covering all the land, including the hill country and the Negev, the lowland and the slopes, and all their kings, including the region of Goshen \([[Josh.11.16|Joshua 11:16]]\). In the tribal allotments, Goshen is listed among the towns in the hill country of Judah \([[Josh.15.51|Joshua 15:51]]\). Apart from these brief references in the book of Joshua, no further details about the town or region of Goshen in Judah are provided in the Bible. Its exact location within the hill country of Judah is uncertain.
