- A man from the tribe of Judah living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at 1Ch.2.37;

Ephlal is mentioned in the genealogy of Judah as the son of Zabad \(1Ch.2.37\). The genealogy traces the descendants of Judah through his son Jerahmeel, and Ephlal is listed as part of this lineage. Zabad, Ephlal's father, is identified as the son of Nathan, who was a descendant of Sheshan \(1Ch.2.36\). No further information is provided about Ephlal's life, his role within the family, or any descendants he may have had. The repetition of Ephlal's name in the same verse \(1Ch.2.37\) is likely for emphasis or clarity in the genealogical record. The inclusion of Ephlal in the genealogy serves to provide a comprehensive account of Judah's descendants and to showcase the continuity of the family line through multiple generations. The mention of Ephlal and his father Zabad demonstrates the importance of documenting even the lesser-known individuals within the genealogies, as they contribute to the overall understanding of the family structure and the relationships between members of the tribe of Judah.
