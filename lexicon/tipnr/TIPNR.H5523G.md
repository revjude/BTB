Succoth was a city located in the territory allocated to the tribe of Gad in Canaan \(Josh. 13:27\). It is first mentioned as the place where Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) built a house for himself and booths \(Succoth\) for his livestock after his meeting with Esau \(Gen. 33:17\). During the time of the judges, Gideon and his men pursued the Midianite kings to Succoth and requested provisions, but the officials of Succoth refused, leading to their punishment after the victory \(Judg. 8:5-16\). In the time of Solomon, Succoth was the location where the bronze works were made for the temple in Jerusalem, as it was situated in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan \(1 Kgs. 7:46; 2 Chr. 4:17\). The city is also mentioned in Psalms 60:6 and 108:7 as part of a poetic description of God's dominion over the land.
