Bigvai was the ancestor of a large group of people who returned to Jerusalem from the Babylonian captivity. According to the records in Ezra and Nehemiah, 2,056 \(Ezr. 2:14\) or 2,067 \(Neh. 7:19\) individuals from Bigvai's family were among the returnees. This significant number suggests that Bigvai's descendants formed an important part of the Jewish community in exile. Additionally, Ezra mentions that Uthai and Zabbud, two leaders from the descendants of Bigvai, led a group of 70 men to Jerusalem during Ezra's own return \(Ezr. 8:14\). The repeated mention of Bigvai's descendants highlights their active role in the restoration of Jerusalem and the Jewish community after the exile.
