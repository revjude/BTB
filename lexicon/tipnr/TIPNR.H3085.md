Jehoaddah, also referred to as Jarah, is mentioned in the genealogies of the tribe of Benjamin in 1 Chronicles 8:36 and 9:42. He is listed as one of the descendants of King Saul, Israel's first king. In both passages, his name appears in the genealogy of Saul's descendants, suggesting that he was a member of the royal family. However, no further information is provided about his life, his role in the family, or his place in the history of Israel. The fact that he is mentioned by two different names, Jehoaddah and Jarah, suggests that one may have been a variant spelling or a nickname. The inclusion of his name in the genealogies serves to trace the lineage of Saul and to highlight the continuing presence of his descendants among the people of Benjamin.
