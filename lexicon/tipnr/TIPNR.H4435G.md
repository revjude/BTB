Milcah is mentioned in the book of Genesis as the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother \(Gen.11.29\). She was the daughter of Haran, who was also the father of Lot \(Gen.11.29\). Milcah and Nahor had eight children together, including Bethuel, who became the father of Rebekah \([[Gen.22.20|Gen.22.20]],23\). When Abraham sent his servant to find a wife for his son Isaac, the servant traveled to the city of Nahor and encountered Rebekah at the well \([[Gen.24.15|Gen.24.15]]\). Upon learning that Rebekah was the granddaughter of Milcah and Nahor, the servant recognized this as a sign of God's guidance and provision \([[Gen.24.24|Gen.24.24]],47\). Milcah's family played a significant role in the continuation of Abraham's lineage, as Rebekah became Isaac's wife and the mother of Jacob and Esau.
