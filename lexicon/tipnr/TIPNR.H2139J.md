Zaccur was one of the sons of Asaph, a prominent Levitical musician during the reigns of King David and King Solomon. Asaph was a leader of the Levitical singers and musicians appointed by David to serve in the tabernacle and later in the temple. Zaccur, along with his brothers, was trained in music and participated in the musical worship services. In the time of Nehemiah, after the Babylonian exile, a descendant of Zaccur named Zacchur is mentioned among the musicians who played at the dedication of the rebuilt wall of Jerusalem. This suggests that Zaccur's family continued to serve as musicians in the temple for generations.
