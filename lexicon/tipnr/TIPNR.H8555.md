Timna is mentioned in [[Gen.36.12|Genesis 36:12]] as a concubine of Eliphaz, the son of Esau. She gave birth to Amalek, who became the ancestor of the Amalekites, a nomadic tribe that lived in the Negev and Sinai desert regions. The Amalekites later became enemies of the Israelites during their wilderness wanderings and the period of the judges and early monarchy. No other details are provided about Timna's life or her relationship with Eliphaz. 

Timna is also mentioned in [[Gen.36.40|Genesis 36:40]] and [[1Chr.1.51|1 Chronicles 1:51]] as one of the chiefs of Edom, a nation descended from Esau. This probably indicates they are descenced from this concubine, though this is not certain.
