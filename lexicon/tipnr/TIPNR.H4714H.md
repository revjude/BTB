Egypt, also known as Mizraim in Hebrew, is mentioned in the Table of Nations in Genesis 10 and 1 Chronicles 1 as one of the descendants of Ham, the son of Noah. Ham's sons, including Egypt, are generally associated with the peoples of Africa. 

In the Genesis account, Egypt is listed alongside his brothers Cush, Put, and Canaan \([[Gen.10.6|Genesis 10:6]]; [[1Chr.1.8|1 Chronicles 1:8]]\). These names correspond to regions and peoples in Africa and the Middle East. 

The descendants of Egypt are further elaborated in [[Gen.10.13|Genesis 10:13]]-14 and [[1Chr.1.11|1 Chronicles 1:11]]-12. The text lists the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites, Pathrusites, Casluhites, and Caphtorites as the peoples descending from Egypt. These names likely represent various tribes or regions within the larger territory of Egypt and its surrounding areas. 

The Pathrusites, for example, are believed to be associated with the region of Pathros in Upper Egypt, while the Caphtorites are often connected with the island of Crete or the Aegean region. 

It is worth noting that the name "Egypt" \(Mizraim\) is a dual form in Hebrew, possibly referring to the two main regions of Egypt: Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt. This dual form may also suggest the idea of Egypt as a powerful and prominent nation. 

In the biblical narrative, Egypt plays a significant role as the place where the Israelites were enslaved for hundreds of years before the Exodus. The land of Egypt is also mentioned in connection with various biblical figures, such as Abraham, Joseph, and Moses. 

The inclusion of Egypt in the Table of Nations serves to trace the origins and spread of the world's populations from the perspective of the ancient Israelites. It also highlights the diversity of nations and peoples that emerged from Noah's descendants after the Flood.
