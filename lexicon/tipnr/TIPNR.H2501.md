Heleph was a town mentioned in [[Josh.19.33|Joshua 19:33]] as part of the border description for the territory allocated to the tribe of Naphtali. The verse states that the border "turned from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim." No further information is provided about the town, and its exact location is unknown. It was likely situated in the northern part of Canaan, within the region assigned to Naphtali. The mention of an oak tree in Zaanannim suggests that Heleph was located near a notable landmark or sacred site.
