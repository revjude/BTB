Romamti-ezer is mentioned in [[1Chr.25.4|1 Chronicles 25:4]] and 31 as one of the sons of Heman, a Levite appointed by King David to lead worship in the temple. Heman, along with Asaph and Jeduthun, was a chief musician and prophet in the service of the tabernacle \(1 Chronicles 25:1, 5\). Romamti-ezer and his brothers were skilled musicians who were trained in singing to the Lord \(1 Chronicles 25:7\). They were divided into twenty-four groups, each responsible for leading worship in the temple for a specific period \(1 Chronicles 25:8-31\). Romamti-ezer was the head of the twenty-fourth division \([[1Chr.25.31|1 Chronicles 25:31]]\). The inclusion of Romamti-ezer and his brothers in the organization of temple worship highlights the importance of music and praise in Israelite worship and the role of the Levites in facilitating this aspect of devotion to God.
