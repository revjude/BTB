Shamgar, mentioned in [[Judg.3.31|Judges 3:31]] and [[Judg.5.6|Judges 5:6]], was a judge of Israel during the period before the monarchy. He is described as the son of Anath, which may refer to his lineage or his place of origin. Shamgar is noted for his remarkable feat of killing 600 Philistines with an oxgoad, a long stick used for driving cattle. This achievement is particularly significant because it occurred during a time when the Philistines were oppressing Israel. Shamgar's victory provided a measure of deliverance for the nation, demonstrating his strength, courage, and leadership. In the Song of Deborah \(Judges 5\), Shamgar is mentioned alongside Jael as a figure who brought relief to Israel during a time of hardship and oppression. Although the text does not provide extensive details about Shamgar's life or the duration of his judgeship, his inclusion in the narrative highlights the role of judges as deliverers and leaders who fought against Israel's enemies and provided temporary respite from oppression.
