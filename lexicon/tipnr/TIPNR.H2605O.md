Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, is mentioned in [[Jer.35.4|Jeremiah 35:4]] in connection with the Rechabites. The Rechabites were a nomadic tribe known for their commitment to abstaining from wine, living in tents, and following the commands of their ancestor, Jonadab son of Rechab. During the reign of King Jehoiakim, Jeremiah was instructed by God to bring the Rechabites to the temple and offer them wine to drink. The Rechabites refused, demonstrating their steadfast obedience to their ancestor's commands. The chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, was used for this encounter. Hanan is described as "the man of God," indicating his prophetic or priestly role. The location of this chamber in the temple suggests that Hanan held a position of importance or respect within the religious community. The association of Hanan with the Rechabites and the use of his chamber for Jeremiah's test highlights the significance of the Rechabites' commitment to their principles and their role as an example of obedience to God.
