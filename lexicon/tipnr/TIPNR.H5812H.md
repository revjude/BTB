The chapter lists the leaders of each tribe who were responsible for overseeing their respective tribes in various administrative and military matters. Azaziah's position as the leader of the half-tribe of Manasseh suggests that he was a prominent figure within his tribe and had the trust of King David. The half-tribe of Manasseh settled on the east side of the Jordan River and played a significant role in the defense of Israel's borders. As the leader, Azaziah would have been responsible for organizing and commanding the warriors of his tribe, as well as representing their interests before the king.
