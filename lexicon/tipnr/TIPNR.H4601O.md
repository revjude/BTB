Maacah was the father of Hanan, who was one of King David's mighty men \([[1Chr.11.43|1Ch.11.43]]\). Hanan is listed among the warriors who joined David during his reign. The mighty men were known for their bravery, loyalty, and military prowess \(2Sa.23.8-39; 1Ch.11.10-47\). They played a significant role in establishing and defending David's kingdom. No further details are provided about Maacah himself in the biblical narrative. His mention as the father of one of David's mighty men suggests that he may have been a person of some influence or status within the tribe of Benjamin. The inclusion of Shephatiah in the list of mighty men highlights the important role that individual warriors played in the success of David's reign and the establishment of the Israelite monarchy.
