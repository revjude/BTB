Philadelphia was a city in the region of Lydia in Asia Minor \(modern-day Turkey\) and was one of the seven churches mentioned in the Book of Revelation \(Rev. 1:11; 3:7\). In the letter to the church in Philadelphia, the risen Christ commends the believers for their faithfulness, despite their limited strength \(Rev. 3:8\). He acknowledges that they have kept His word and have not denied His name \(Rev. 3:8\). Christ also mentions that He has placed before them an open door that no one can shut \(Rev. 3:8\), possibly referring to opportunities for spreading the gospel. The church in Philadelphia is promised protection from the hour of trial that is coming upon the whole world \(Rev. 3:10\) and is encouraged to hold fast to what they have, so that no one may take their crown \(Rev. 3:11\). The faithful in Philadelphia are assured that Christ will make them a pillar in the temple of God, and they will bear the name of God, the New Jerusalem, and Christ's new name \(Rev. 3:12\).
