Chesalon, also referred to as Mount Jearim, was a place mentioned as one of the landmarks on the western part of the northern boundary of Judah \([[Josh.15.10|Joshua 15:10]]\). It was situated beyond Mount Seir and was apparently located on the shoulder or side of Mount Jearim, which means "Mount of Forests." Although Mount Jearim was in close proximity to Kirjath-jearim, the two were not necessarily connected. 

Chesalon was the next landmark after Bethshemesh in the description of Judah's border. The exact location is uncertain, but it has been identified with the modern village of Kesla, located about six miles northeast of Ain Shems \(Bethshemesh\) in the western mountains of Judah. In the 4th century AD, Eusebius and Jerome described Chesalon as a very large village. 

The name Chesalon may be derived from the Hebrew verb "kasal," which can mean "to be confident," often in a foolish or stupid way. However, due to the lack of context, the exact meaning and significance of the name remain unclear.
