Holon was a town located in the hill country of Judah that was assigned to the Levites \([[Josh.15.51|Joshua 15:51]]; 21:15\). In [[1Chr.6.58|1 Chronicles 6:58]], it is referred to as Hilen. The exact location is uncertain, but it may be identified with the ruins of Beit 'Alam. As a Levitical city, Holon would have been inhabited by the priestly tribe of Levi who were responsible for the religious duties in Israel.
