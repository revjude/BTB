Syrtis is mentioned in Acts 27:17 as a dangerous area of shallow waters that sailors feared. As the ship carrying Paul to Rome was caught in a storm, the crew took measures to avoid being driven into the Syrtis. The Syrtis, also known as the Gulf of Sirte, is located off the coast of modern-day Libya in North Africa. It was notorious in ancient times for its shifting sand bars and treacherous currents, which could easily trap and wreck ships. The mention of Syrtis in the context of Paul's journey to Rome highlights the perils faced by sailors in the Mediterranean Sea during that time.
