The Jericho Valley, also known as the Jordan Valley or the Plain of Jericho, is the area surrounding the city of Jericho. It is mentioned in Deuteronomy 34:3 as part of the land shown to Moses by God before his death on Mount Nebo. The valley is located in the Jordan Rift Valley, north of the Dead Sea and west of the Jordan River. It is known for its fertile soil and warm climate, which allows for the cultivation of various crops, including dates and other fruits. The Jericho Valley's strategic location made it an important trade route and a key entry point into Canaan.
