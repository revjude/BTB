- A priest living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Neh.12.11b|Act.4.6]]; called John  **<big>[[G2491|Ἰωάννης]]</big>**

John is mentioned briefly in Acts 4:6 as a member of the high priest's family. He was present when Peter and John were brought before the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council, after healing a lame man and preaching in the temple. The Sanhedrin questioned the apostles about the power and authority by which they had performed the miracle and taught the people. John's presence, along with Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, Alexander, and other members of the high priest's family, underscores the significance of the event and the perceived threat the apostles' actions posed to the religious establishment. However, no further information is provided about John's specific role or his reaction to the apostles' testimony.
