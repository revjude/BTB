Cappadocia was an ancient region located in central Asia Minor, in modern-day Turkey. It is mentioned twice in the New Testament. In Acts 2:9, Cappadocians were among the people present in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles. This suggests that there were Jewish inhabitants from Cappadocia who had come to Jerusalem for the feast. 

In [[1Pet.1.1|1 Peter 1:1]], the apostle Peter addresses his letter to the "pilgrims of the Dispersion," including those in Cappadocia, indicating the presence of Christian believers in the region. These believers were likely converts from the Jewish diaspora and Gentile proselytes. 

Cappadocia was known for its unique geological features, including underground cities and rock-cut churches, many of which were used by early Christians as hiding places during times of persecution. The region played a significant role in the early history of Christianity and was home to several important church fathers, such as Basil the Great and Gregory of Nazianzus.
