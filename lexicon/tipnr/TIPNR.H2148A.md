Zechariah was a Levite who lived during the reign of King David. He held various responsibilities related to the tabernacle and its service. Zechariah is mentioned as one of the gatekeepers who guarded the entrance to the tabernacle. He was also a skilled musician and was appointed by David to play the lyre and harp during the transportation of the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem. 

Zechariah's musical abilities were recognized, and he was among the Levites chosen to lead the music and singing when the ark was brought into the tent David had pitched for it. He also participated in the musical celebration when the ark was finally brought into the temple built by Solomon. 

In addition to his musical duties, Zechariah was entrusted with the responsibility of distributing the offerings and tithes among his fellow Levites. He was known for his integrity and fairness in this role. 

Zechariah's descendants continued to serve as gatekeepers in the temple, with his son Meshelemiah being appointed as the chief gatekeeper during David's reign. The faithful service of Zechariah and his family in the tabernacle and temple highlights the important role the Levites played in maintaining the worship and service of God.
