Azariah is mentioned in [[2Chr.31.10|2 Chronicles 31:10]]-13 as the chief priest from the family of Zadok during the reign of King Hezekiah. He played a significant role in the religious reforms initiated by Hezekiah, which included the restoration of the temple and the reinstitution of the Passover celebration. When Hezekiah called for the people to bring their tithes and contributions to the temple, Azariah testified that the Lord had blessed the people, and there was an abundance of provisions. He oversaw the distribution of the contributions among the priests and Levites, ensuring that they received their portions according to their divisions and duties. Azariah's leadership as chief priest helped to restore proper worship and support for the temple service during Hezekiah's reign.
