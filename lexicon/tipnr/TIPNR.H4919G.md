Meshillemoth was an Ephraimite leader who lived during the reign of Pekah, king of Israel. When Pekah's army defeated Judah and took captives, Meshillemoth, along with other leaders such as Azariah, Berechiah, and Jehizkiah, stood against the army and opposed the enslavement of their fellow Israelites \([[2Chr.28.12|2Ch.28.12]]\). They urged the army to release the captives, clothe them, and return them to Jericho, citing the Lord's fierce wrath against Israel.
