Meroz is a place mentioned only once in the Bible, in the Song of Deborah and Barak \([[Judg.5.23|Judges 5:23]]\). The exact location of Meroz is unknown, but it was likely situated near the Kishon River, close to where the Israelites, led by Deborah and Barak, fought against the Canaanite army commanded by Sisera. In the song, the angel of the Lord pronounces a curse upon Meroz and its inhabitants for not coming to help in the battle against Sisera. The severity of the curse suggests that Meroz may have been in a position to provide significant assistance but chose not to do so. Some scholars propose identifying Meroz with el-Murussus, a village about 5 miles northwest of Beisan, on the slopes north of the Jezreel Valley, but this remains uncertain.
