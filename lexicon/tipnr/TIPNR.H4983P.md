Mattaniah was a Levite who lived during the time of Nehemiah, after the Babylonian exile. He was appointed by Nehemiah as one of the treasurers responsible for distributing the contributions to the Levites \([[Neh.13.13|Nehemiah 13:13]]\). This appointment came as part of Nehemiah's reforms to ensure that the Levites received their proper portions and could focus on their duties in the temple. Mattaniah's role as a treasurer demonstrates the importance of proper administration and support for those serving in the house of God.
