Hephzibah is mentioned in the Bible as the mother of King Manasseh, who ruled over Judah. She was the wife of King Hezekiah \([[2Kgs.21.1|2Ki.21.1]]\). Manasseh, born to Hezekiah and Hephzibah, succeeded his father as king at the age of twelve and reigned for fifty-five years in Jerusalem. Manasseh's reign was marked by idolatry and wickedness, as he undid many of the religious reforms his father had implemented. He even practiced child sacrifice and consulted mediums and spiritists. Despite this, God showed mercy to Manasseh when he humbled himself and prayed for forgiveness. No further details about Hephzibah's life or character are provided in the Bible. \([[2Kgs.21.1|2Ki.21.1]]\).
