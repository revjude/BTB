Shelah was the third and youngest son of Judah, born to him in Chezib \([[Gen.38.5|Genesis 38:5]]\). After the deaths of his older brothers, Er and Onan, Judah promised Tamar, Er's widow, that Shelah would marry her when he grew up. However, Judah did not keep this promise \([[Gen.38.11|Genesis 38:11]],14,26\). 

Shelah's descendants were called Shelanites \([[Num.26.20|Numbers 26:20]]\) and were one of the clans of Judah. They were included in the census of the tribe of Judah in the wilderness \([[Num.26.20|Numbers 26:20]]\) and in the genealogies of Judah \([[1Chr.2.3|1 Chronicles 2:3]]; 4:21\). Shelah's descendants included potters and linen workers who lived in Judah \([[1Chr.4.21|1 Chronicles 4:21]]-23\).
