Mattaniah was a Levite who lived during the time of Nehemiah, after the Babylonian exile. He was a descendant of Asaph, one of the chief musicians appointed by David. Mattaniah served as a singer in the temple \([[Neh.11.22|Nehemiah 11:22]]\). During the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, Mattaniah was among the Levites who led the people in praise and thanksgiving to God \([[Neh.12.35|Nehemiah 12:35]]\). His role as a singer highlights the importance of worship and the role of skilled musicians in the restored community of Israel.
