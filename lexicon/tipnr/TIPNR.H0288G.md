Ahimelech, also known as Ahijah, was the priest at Nob during the reign of King Saul. He was the son of Ahitub and the father of Abiathar. When David was fleeing from Saul, he came to Ahimelech at Nob seeking help. Ahimelech, unaware of the conflict between David and Saul, provided David with the consecrated bread and the sword of Goliath. \(1Sa.21.1-9\) 

Doeg the Edomite, one of Saul's servants, witnessed this interaction and reported it to Saul. Saul summoned Ahimelech and the other priests, accusing them of conspiring with David against him. Despite Ahimelech's defense of his actions, Saul ordered the execution of the priests. Doeg carried out the order, killing Ahimelech and eighty-four other priests. \([[1Sam.22.9|1Sa.22.9]]-19\). 

Abiathar, Ahimelech's son, was the only one who escaped the massacre. He fled to David and brought with him the ephod, a priestly garment used for seeking God's guidance. \([[1Sam.22.20|1Sa.22.20]]-23; 23.6; 30.7\) 

The story of Ahimelech's tragic fate is also referenced in Psalm 52, which is attributed to David when Doeg informed Saul about Ahimelech's assistance to David. The psalm reflects on the consequences of those who trust in evil and contrasts them with those who trust in God's steadfast love. \(Psa.52.1\)
