Jehiel, the son of Shechaniah, is mentioned in [[Ezra.8.9|Ezra 8:9]] as one of the leaders who returned to Jerusalem with Ezra. This chapter lists the heads of families who joined Ezra in his journey from Babylon to Jerusalem, intending to restore worship and obedience to the Law of Moses. Jehiel is listed along with other leaders such as Zechariah, Sherebiah, and Obadiah, each accompanied by a number of men from their respective families. The text does not provide any further details about Jehiel's background or his role in the community. However, his inclusion in this list suggests that he was a prominent figure among the returnees and had a significant number of people under his leadership. Ezra's return to Jerusalem was a crucial event in the history of Israel, as it marked the beginning of a new era of religious and social reform after the Babylonian exile.
