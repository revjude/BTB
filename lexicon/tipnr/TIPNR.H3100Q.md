Joel is mentioned in [[2Chr.29.12|2 Chronicles 29:12]] as one of the Levites who participated in the purification and restoration of the temple during the reign of King Hezekiah. Hezekiah, a righteous king of Judah, initiated a series of religious reforms, which included cleansing the temple and reinstating proper worship practices. Joel, along with other Levites from the clans of Kohath, Merari, and Gershon, responded to the king's command and took part in the temple purification process. The Kohathites, Joel's clan, were traditionally responsible for the care and transportation of the most sacred items in the tabernacle and temple. Joel's participation in this significant event demonstrates the Levites' commitment to restoring and maintaining the proper worship of God in Judah.
