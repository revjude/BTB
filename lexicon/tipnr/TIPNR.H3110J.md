Johanan is mentioned in [[1Chr.6.9|1 Chronicles 6:9]]-10 as part of the genealogy of the Levites, specifically in the lineage of Kohath. He is listed as the son of Elkanah and the father of Azariah, who served as a priest during the reign of Solomon. This genealogy traces the ancestry of Samuel, the prophet and last judge of Israel, back to the time of Moses and Aaron. The mention of Johanan in this context highlights the importance of the Levitical lineage and their role in serving in the tabernacle and, later, the temple. However, no additional information is provided about Johanan's life or his specific responsibilities as a Levite.
