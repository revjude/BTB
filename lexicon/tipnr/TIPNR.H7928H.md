Shechem is listed in [[1Chr.7.19|1 Chronicles 7:19]] as one of the sons of Shemida, who was a descendant of Manasseh. He is mentioned in the genealogical record of Manasseh, but no additional information is given about his life or role within the tribe. This Shechem is likely a different individual from the Shechem who was a son of Gilead, also from Manasseh.
