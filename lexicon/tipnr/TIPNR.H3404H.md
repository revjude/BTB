Jerijah is mentioned in 1 Chronicles as a Levite leader during the reign of King David. He is described as the chief of the Hebronites, a Levitical family descended from Hebron. When David organized the Levites for service, Jerijah and his relatives were appointed to oversee the work outside the tabernacle, which included administrative and judicial duties. This appointment demonstrates the important role that the Levites played in the religious and civil life of ancient Israel, and highlights Jerijah's leadership position within his family and the Levitical community.
