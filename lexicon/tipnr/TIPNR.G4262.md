The Sheep Gate was an important entrance in Jerusalem's walls, first mentioned in Nehemiah's account of the city's reconstruction. The high priest Eliashib and his fellow priests took responsibility for rebuilding this gate \([[Neh.3.1|Nehemiah 3:1]]\), making it the first structure mentioned in Nehemiah's systematic description of the wall's reconstruction. 

 The gate marked a significant point in Jerusalem's defensive walls. It appears at both the beginning and end of Nehemiah's description of the wall repairs \([[Neh.3.1|Nehemiah 3:1]], 32\), suggesting it may have been a starting and ending point for the reconstruction project. During the dedication of the rebuilt walls, one of the thanksgiving processions passed through the Sheep Gate \([[Neh.12.39|Nehemiah 12:39]]\). 

 In the New Testament, the gate is mentioned indirectly in connection with the Pool of Bethesda, which was located near the Sheep Gate \([[John.5.2|John 5:2]]\). This reference helps establish its location in the northeastern section of Jerusalem. 

 The gate probably derived its name from its use as an entrance point for sheep being brought to the nearby Temple for sacrifice, though this is not explicitly stated in Scripture. 

 Probably corresponds to the modern location near the Lion's Gate \(also called St. Stephen's Gate\) in Jerusalem's Old City walls.
