Ahimoth, also referred to as Mahath, is mentioned in the genealogy of the Levites, specifically in the lineage of Kohath. He was the son of Elkanah, who was a descendant of Kohath, one of the three sons of Levi. \([[1Chr.6.25|1Ch.6.25]],35\) 

The Kohathites were one of the three main divisions of the Levites, along with the Gershonites and Merarites. They were responsible for the care and transportation of the most sacred items in the tabernacle, including the Ark of the Covenant, the table of showbread, the lampstand, and the altars. \(Num.3.27-32\) 

Ahimoth's mention in the genealogy highlights the importance of the Levitical lineage and their roles in serving in the tabernacle and later in the temple. However, no specific details about Ahimoth's life or duties are provided in the Bible.
