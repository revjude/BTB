Moresheth, also known as Moresheth-gath, was a town in Judah and the hometown of the prophet Micah \(Mic. 1:1\). It was located near the Philistine city of Gath \(Mic. 1:14\). The prophet Micah, who prophesied during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah \(Mic. 1:1\), was from Moresheth. Jeremiah mentions a prophecy of Micah of Moresheth that was given during the reign of Hezekiah \(Jer. 26:18\).
