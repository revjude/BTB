Azaziah is mentioned in [[2Chr.31.13|2 Chronicles 31:13]] as one of the Levites appointed by King Hezekiah to oversee the distribution of the freewill offerings brought to the temple. During Hezekiah's reign, there was a revival of faith and a restoration of proper worship practices. The people brought an abundance of offerings, and Hezekiah appointed reliable men, including Azaziah, to ensure that these offerings were distributed fairly among the priests and Levites according to their divisions and duties. Azaziah's appointment to this role indicates that he was a trusted and responsible individual who could handle the important task of managing the offerings and ensuring that they were used for their intended purpose of supporting the temple service and personnel.
