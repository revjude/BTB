Beer-elim is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Isa.15.8|Isaiah 15:8]], as part of a prophecy against Moab. The name "Beer-elim" means "well of the mighty ones" or "well of the terebinths" in Hebrew. 

In the prophecy, Isaiah describes the destruction and mourning that would come upon Moab, a nation located east of the Dead Sea. The passage states that "the cry of distress has gone around the territory of Moab; its wailing reaches to Eglaim, its wailing reaches to Beer-elim." 

The exact location of Beer-elim is not specified in the Bible, but based on the context of the prophecy, it was likely a place within the territory of Moab. The mention of Beer-elim alongside Eglaim suggests that it may have been a significant town or landmark in the region. 

The prophecy against Moab in Isaiah 15 is part of a larger series of oracles against various nations, highlighting God's judgment against those who oppose Him and His people. The reference to Beer-elim serves to emphasize the widespread nature of Moab's distress and the extent of the impending destruction.
