Eliphelet is listed among the Israelites who had married foreign women during the Babylonian exile \([[Ezra.10.33|Ezr.10.33]]\). After the return to Jerusalem, Ezra the priest discovered that many of the Israelites, including priests and Levites, had intermarried with the neighboring peoples, which was against God's command. Eliphelet was one of those who had taken a foreign wife. As part of the covenant renewal led by Ezra, Eliphelet and the others agreed to put away their foreign wives to demonstrate their commitment to following God's law. The Bible does not provide any further information about Eliphelet's life, family, or role in the community of the returned exiles.
