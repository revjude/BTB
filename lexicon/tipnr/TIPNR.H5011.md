Nob was a city of priests located near Jerusalem, possibly between the city and Anathoth \(1 Sam. 21:1; 22:9, 11, 19; Neh. 11:32; Isa. 10:32\). It is most notable as the site where King Saul ordered the massacre of the priests who had assisted David when he was fleeing from Saul \(1 Sam. 22:11-19\). Ahimelech, the priest at Nob, had provided David with the sacred bread of the Presence and the sword of Goliath \(1 Sam. 21:1-9\). Nob was also one of the places where the Ark of the Covenant was kept for a time during its travels \(2 Sam. 6:1\). The exact location of Nob is uncertain, but it was likely situated on a hill north of Jerusalem, possibly at Ras el-Mesharif or another nearby site that afforded a view of the city.
