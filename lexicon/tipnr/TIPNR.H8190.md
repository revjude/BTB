Shaashgaz, mentioned in [[Esth.2.14|Esther 2:14]], was a eunuch in the court of King Ahasuerus \(Xerxes I\) of Persia. He was appointed by the king to be in charge of the concubines in the royal harem. After each young woman had completed her twelve months of beauty treatments and had spent the night with the king, she would be placed under the care of Shaashgaz. This procedure was part of the king's search for a new queen after Queen Vashti's dismissal. Shaashgaz's role was to oversee the concubines and ensure their well-being within the harem.
