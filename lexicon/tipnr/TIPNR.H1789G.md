- A man living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.36.21|Gen.36.21]]; 
- referred to as Dishan<[[H1789G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ִּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יש</span>ָׁ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ן</span>\), or Dishan<[[H1787I]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ִּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יש</span>ֹׁ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ן</span>\); 
-  son of Seir<[[H8165B]]>; 
- a brother of Lotan<[[H3877]]>, Shobal<[[H7732G]]>, Zibeon<[[H6649]]>, Dishon<[[H1787G]]>, Ezer<[[H0687]]> and Timna<[[H8555]]>; 
-  father of Uz<[[H5780I]]>, Aran<[[H0765]]>.

Dishan is mentioned in the genealogies of Esau's family in Genesis 36 and 1 Chronicles 1. He is listed as one of the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land of Edom before Esau's descendants settled there \(Genesis 36:20-21; [[1Chr.1.38|1 Chronicles 1:38]]\). 

Dishan's sons are named as Uz and Aran \([[Gen.36.28|Genesis 36:28]]; [[1Chr.1.42|1 Chronicles 1:42]]\). These genealogies demonstrate the intermingling of Esau's descendants with the Horites, as Esau's grandson, Esau's son Eliphaz's son, was named Uz \([[Gen.36.28|Genesis 36:28]]\). 

The Horites were the original inhabitants of Mount Seir, the region south of the Dead Sea, before Esau's descendants displaced them \(Deuteronomy 2:12\). The inclusion of Dishan and other Horite names in Esau's genealogy suggests that there was intermarriage between the two groups. 

Apart from these genealogical references, no further information is provided about Dishan or his specific role in the biblical narrative. His mention serves to trace the origins and relationships of the people living in the region of Edom during the time of the patriarchs.
