Pashhur was a priest, the son of Immer, who opposed the prophet Jeremiah, according to Jeremiah 20. He held the position of chief officer in the temple. When he heard Jeremiah prophesying that Jerusalem would be destroyed, Pashhur had Jeremiah beaten and put in the stocks. The next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah, the prophet told him that God had renamed him Magor-missabib, which means "terror on every side." Jeremiah prophesied that Pashhur and his friends would go into captivity and die in Babylon as punishment for their false prophecies and leading the people astray.
