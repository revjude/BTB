Manahath, also referred to as Nohah, is mentioned in [[1Chr.8.6|1 Chronicles 8:6]] as a place where some Benjamites lived after returning from the Babylonian exile. The verse states that the sons of Ehud, who were heads of fathers' houses of the inhabitants of Geba, were carried into exile to Manahath. No further details about the location or significance of Manahath are provided in the Bible. Some scholars suggest that Manahath may be the same as Menuhoth, a place mentioned in connection with the Benjamite genealogy \(1 Chronicles 2:52, 54\).
