In the time of Ezra, a Jonathan is mentioned as one of the men who opposed Ezra's demand that Jewish men put away their foreign wives \([[Ezra.10.15|Ezra 10:15]]\). After the return from Babylonian exile, some Jewish men had married non-Jewish women, which Ezra saw as a violation of God's law. Ezra called for the people to separate themselves from the peoples around them and from their foreign wives \(Ezra 10:11\). However, Jonathan, along with Jahzeiah and Meshullam, took a stand against this. The text states that only these three men opposed Ezra in this matter, suggesting it was an unpopular minority position.
