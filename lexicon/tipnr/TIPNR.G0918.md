Apostle living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Bartholomew</span> was one of the twelve apostles chosen by Jesus.
- An apostle living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Matt.10.3|Mat.10.3]]; 
- only referred to as Bartholomew **<big>[[G0918|Βαρθολομαῖος]]</big>**.

Bartholomew was one of the twelve apostles selected by Jesus Christ to be part of His inner circle \([[Matt.10.3|Matthew 10:3]]; [[Mark.3.18|Mark 3:18]]; [[Luke.6.14|Luke 6:14]]\). He is always mentioned in the lists of the apostles, indicating his importance within the group. However, beyond his inclusion in these lists, no specific details about his background, life, or ministry are provided in the New Testament. Bartholomew is also named in Acts 1:13 as one of the apostles gathered in the upper room after Jesus' ascension, praying and waiting for the coming of the Holy Spirit. Some scholars suggest that Bartholomew may be the same person as Nathanael, who is mentioned in John's Gospel \(John 1:45-51; 21:2\), but this identification is not conclusively established in the biblical text. Tradition holds that Bartholomew preached the gospel in various regions, including India and Armenia, and suffered martyrdom for his faith, but these accounts are not recorded in the New Testament.
