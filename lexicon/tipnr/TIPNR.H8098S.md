Shemaiah was a false prophet who opposed Nehemiah during the rebuilding of Jerusalem's wall. In [[Neh.6.10|Nehemiah 6:10]], Nehemiah describes an encounter with Shemaiah, who was shut up in his house. Shemaiah claimed to have received a prophecy that Nehemiah should hide in the temple to avoid being killed by his enemies. However, Nehemiah recognized this as a false prophecy intended to intimidate him and discredit his leadership. Nehemiah refused to flee, stating that a man in his position should not enter the temple to save his life. This incident highlights the challenges and opposition Nehemiah faced while trying to restore Jerusalem and the Jewish community.
