Molid is mentioned in [[1Chr.2.29|1 Chronicles 2:29]] as part of the genealogy of the tribe of Judah. He was the son of Abisur and his wife, Abihail. 

The genealogy in this passage traces the descendants of Judah, one of the twelve sons of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) \(Israel\), and provides insight into the family lines within the tribe. Molid is listed as a member of the clan of Jerahmeel, which was one of the major families within Judah. 

Apart from being named as the son of Abisur and Abihail, no additional information is provided about Molid's life, occupation, or role within the tribe. The genealogical record serves primarily to establish the lineage and family connections within Judah, rather than to provide detailed accounts of each individual. 

The inclusion of Molid in this genealogy highlights the importance of family heritage and tribal identity in ancient Israelite society. It also demonstrates the meticulous record-keeping of the chronicler in preserving the names and relationships of even the lesser-known members of the tribe. 

As with many of the individuals mentioned in these genealogies, Molid's contribution to the overall narrative of Israel's history may be limited, but his presence in the record helps to paint a more complete picture of the people and families that made up the nation.
