- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[3John.1.1|3Jn.1.1]]; 
- only referred to as Gaius **<big>[[G1050|Γάϊος]]</big>**.

Gaius is the recipient of John's third epistle, a short letter in which the apostle commends him for his faithfulness and hospitality. John addresses Gaius as a dear friend whom he loves in the truth \([[3John.1.1|3 John 1:1]]\). He expresses his joy upon hearing that Gaius is walking in the truth and supporting the work of the gospel \(3 John 1:3-4\). John specifically praises Gaius for his hospitality towards traveling missionaries, even though they were strangers to him \(3 John 1:5-8\). This hospitality was essential for the spread of the gospel, as these missionaries relied on the support of believers like Gaius. John also mentions a certain Diotrephes who was causing problems in the church and refusing to welcome the missionaries \(3 John 1:9-10\). In contrast, John encourages Gaius to continue doing what is good and not to imitate what is evil \([[3John.1.1|3 John 1:1]]1\). The letter to Gaius provides insight into the challenges and importance of hospitality and support within the early Christian community.
