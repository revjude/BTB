Ephah is mentioned in the genealogy of Judah as a concubine of Caleb, the son of Hezron \([[1Chr.2.46|1Ch.2.46]]\). She bore Caleb three sons: Haran, Moza, and Gazez. The inclusion of Ephah and her sons in the genealogy highlights the importance of recording the various branches of Judah's descendants, even those born to concubines. Concubines were secondary wives who held a lower social status than the primary wife but were still considered part of the family. Ephah's sons are listed alongside Caleb's other children, indicating their recognition within the family line. No further information is provided about Ephah's background, her relationship with Caleb, or the lives of her sons. Her mention in the genealogy serves to provide a comprehensive record of Caleb's descendants and to showcase the diverse family structure within the tribe of Judah.
