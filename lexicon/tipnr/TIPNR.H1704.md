- A man living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, only mentioned at [[Lev.24.11|Lev.24.11]]; 
- only referred to as Dibri **<big>[[H1704|דִּבְרִי]]</big>**; 
-  father of Shelomith **<big>[[H8019|שְׁלֹמִית]]</big>**.

Dibri, a man from the tribe of Dan, is mentioned in [[Lev.24.11|Leviticus 24:11]] as the father of Shelomith, whose son was involved in a blasphemy incident in the Israelite camp. The verse states that Shelomith's son, whose father was an Egyptian, blasphemed the name of God and cursed during a fight with an Israelite man. 

As a result of this incident, God instructed Moses that the man who blasphemed should be brought outside the camp and stoned to death by the congregation \(Leviticus 24:14\). This event also led to the establishment of a law stating that anyone who blasphemes the name of the Lord must be put to death \(Leviticus 24:16\). 

Dibri's mention in this passage serves to identify Shelomith and her son, highlighting the fact that the blasphemer was the offspring of an Israelite woman and an Egyptian man. This detail may suggest that the man's mixed background influenced his actions or that his offense was particularly egregious because he was not a full-blooded Israelite. 

The incident involving Dibri's grandson emphasizes the seriousness of blasphemy in ancient Israelite society and the importance of revering God's name. It also demonstrates that God's laws applied equally to all those living among the Israelites, regardless of their lineage.
