The Potsherd Gate, also known as the Harsith Gate, was one of the gates of Jerusalem mentioned in the book of Jeremiah \(Jer. 19:2\). The Lord instructed Jeremiah to go to the Potsherd Gate, which was near the entrance of the Valley of Ben Hinnom \(or Gehenna\), and proclaim a message of judgment against the people of Judah \(Jer. 19:1-2\). The Valley of Ben Hinnom was notorious for the practice of child sacrifice to the pagan god Molech \(Jer. 32:35\). Jeremiah was told to shatter an earthenware jar in front of the elders and priests as a symbol of the impending destruction of Jerusalem and its people \(Jer. 19:10-11\). The Potsherd Gate likely received its name from the fragments of broken pottery \(potsherds\) that were discarded in the nearby valley. The gate's location near the Valley of Ben Hinnom, a place associated with idolatry and judgment, underscores the severity of Jeremiah's prophetic message and the consequences of Judah's unfaithfulness to God.
