- A woman living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.22.23|Gen.22.23]]; 
- referred to as Rebekah<[[H7259]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ק</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>\), or Rebekah<[[G4479]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ῥεβέκκα</span>\); 
-  daughter of Bethuel<[[H1328A]]>; 
- a sister of Laban<[[H3837A]]>; 
- wife of Isaac<[[H3327]]>; 
-  mother of Esau<[[H6215G]]> and Israel<[[H3478]]>.

Rebekah was the daughter of Bethuel and the granddaughter of Nahor, Abraham's brother \([[Gen.22.23|Genesis 22:23]]\). She became the wife of Isaac after a servant of Abraham was sent to find a suitable bride for him \(Genesis 24\). Rebekah was a beautiful woman and was chosen by God to be Isaac's wife \([[Gen.24.15|Genesis 24:15]]-67\). She was barren for many years, but Isaac prayed for her, and she conceived twins \([[Gen.25.21|Genesis 25:21]]\). During her pregnancy, the Lord revealed to Rebekah that two nations were in her womb and that the older would serve the younger \(Genesis 25:23\). Rebekah gave birth to Esau and Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) \(Genesis 25:24-26\). She favored Jacob over Esau and helped him deceive Isaac into giving him the firstborn's blessing \(Genesis 27\). This led to a conflict between the brothers, and Jacob had to flee to escape Esau's anger \(Genesis 27:41-45\). Rebekah's deception had consequences for the family, but God's plan for Jacob prevailed. Rebekah's nurse, Deborah, died and was buried near Bethel \([[Gen.35.8|Genesis 35:8]]\). Rebekah died and was buried in the cave of Machpelah, where Abraham and Sarah were also buried \([[Gen.49.31|Genesis 49:31]]\). In the New Testament, Paul uses Rebekah's story to illustrate God's sovereignty in election \([[Rom.9.10|Romans 9:10]]-12\).
