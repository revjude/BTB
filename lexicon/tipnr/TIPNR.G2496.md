Jehoram, also known as Joram, was the son of Jehoshaphat and became king of Judah. He reigned for eight years in Jerusalem. Jehoram married Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel. He followed the evil ways of the kings of Israel and did what was wrong in the eyes of the Lord. During his reign, Edom revolted against Judah's rule. Jehoram engaged in battle with Edom but was surrounded. He managed to break through during the night. The Lord struck Jehoram with an incurable disease of the bowels, and he died in great pain. His son Ahaziah succeeded him as king.
