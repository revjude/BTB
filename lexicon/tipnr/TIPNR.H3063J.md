- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Neh.12.8|Neh.12.8]];

Judah is mentioned in [[Neh.12.8|Nehemiah 12:8]] and 12:34 as one of the Levites who participated in the dedication ceremony of the wall of Jerusalem. The context of the passage is the celebration and consecration of the newly rebuilt wall during the time of Nehemiah \(Nehemiah 12:27-43\). 

In verse 8, Judah is listed among the Levites who were leading the thanksgiving choirs during the dedication ceremony. These Levites were praising God with songs of thanksgiving and accompanied by musical instruments \(Nehemiah 12:27\). 

In verse 34, Judah is mentioned again as part of the procession that walked on top of the wall. He was in the group that went toward the right, along with other priests, Levites, and leaders \(Nehemiah 12:31-37\). 

The participation of Judah and the other Levites in the dedication ceremony highlights the importance of worship and thanksgiving in the restoration of Jerusalem and the spiritual renewal of the people.
