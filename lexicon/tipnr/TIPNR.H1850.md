Dophkah was one of the places where the Israelites camped during their wilderness wanderings after leaving Egypt \([[Num.33.12|Numbers 33:12]]-13\). It is mentioned in the list of the stages of Israel's journey, between the locations of Wilderness of Sin and Alush. The exact location of Dophkah is unknown, but it was likely situated in the Sinai Peninsula, along the route the Israelites took toward Mount Sinai. As with many of the other campsites during the wilderness journey, Dophkah would have been a temporary stopping point for the Israelites as they followed God's guidance through the desert.
