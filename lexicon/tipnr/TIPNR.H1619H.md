Gareb is a hill mentioned only once in the Bible, in the book of Jeremiah. In a prophecy concerning the future restoration and expansion of Jerusalem, Jeremiah declares that the city will be rebuilt and that its boundaries will extend "as far as the hill Gareb" \([[Jer.31.39|Jeremiah 31:39]]\). 

The exact location of the hill of Gareb is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated near Jerusalem, possibly to the west or northwest of the city. The name "Gareb" is derived from a Hebrew word meaning "scabby" or "leprous," which may suggest that the hill was associated with a place where people with skin diseases were quarantined. 

Jeremiah's prophecy indicates that, in the future, Jerusalem will be rebuilt and its boundaries will be extended to include the hill of Gareb. This expansion of the city's limits symbolizes the growth and prosperity that will characterize Jerusalem during the time of its restoration. 

Although the hill of Gareb is only mentioned briefly in the Bible, its inclusion in Jeremiah's prophecy highlights the significance of Jerusalem's future restoration and the importance of its expanded boundaries.
