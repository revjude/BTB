Shobek is mentioned in [[Neh.10.24|Nehemiah 10:24]] as one of the Levites who signed the covenant under the leadership of Nehemiah. After the completion of the wall of Jerusalem and the public reading of the Law, the people of Israel made a solemn covenant to follow God's commandments and to separate themselves from the surrounding nations. Shobek, along with other Levites, priests, and leaders, signed this covenant, pledging to uphold the Law of Moses and to support the temple service. The signing of the covenant was a significant event in the spiritual reformation of the Jewish community after their return from Babylonian exile, and Shobek's participation demonstrates his commitment to God and his role as a Levite in the restored community.
