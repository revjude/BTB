Michael is mentioned in the book of Ezra as one of the descendants of Shephatiah who returned to Jerusalem with Ezra \([[Ezra.8.8|Ezr.8.8]]\). In the context of Ezra 8, Ezra gathers a group of exiles to return to Jerusalem from Babylon. He assembles them at the river that flows to Ahava and records the genealogy of those who joined him. Michael is listed among the men of Shephatiah's descendants, along with Zebadiah and eighty other males \([[Ezra.8.8|Ezr.8.8]]\). No further details about Michael's life, family, or role in the return to Jerusalem are provided in the biblical text. His mention serves to document the individuals who participated in this significant event in Israel's history.
