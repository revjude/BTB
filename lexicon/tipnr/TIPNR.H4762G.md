Mareshah was a town located in the Shephelah \(lowlands\) of Judah \([[Josh.15.44|Joshua 15:44]]\). It was one of the cities fortified by King Rehoboam after the division of the kingdom \([[2Chr.11.8|2 Chronicles 11:8]]\). Mareshah is best known as the site of the battle between King Asa of Judah and Zerah the Ethiopian, who came against Judah with a vast army. Asa cried out to the Lord, and God granted him a decisive victory over the Ethiopians \([[2Chr.14.9|2 Chronicles 14:9]]-15\). The prophet Micah, who was from Mareshah \(Micah 1:1\), prophesied judgment against the city, declaring that a conqueror would come against it \([[Mic.1.15|Micah 1:15]]\). King Jehoshaphat of Judah joined with Ahaziah of Israel in a shipping venture at Ezion-geber, but the ships were wrecked, as prophesied by Eliezer of Mareshah \(2 Chronicles 20:35-37\).
