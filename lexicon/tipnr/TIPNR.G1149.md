Dalmatia was a region located on the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea, in what is now Croatia. It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[2Tim.4.10|2 Timothy 4:10]], where Paul writes that Titus has gone to Dalmatia. This suggests that Dalmatia was a place where early Christian missionaries traveled to spread the gospel. Dalmatia was part of the Roman province of Illyricum, which was known for its rugged terrain and fierce tribes. Despite the challenges, Paul and his associates were committed to sharing the message of Christ throughout the region.
