Hazer-hatticon, meaning "the middle village," was a place mentioned in the prophet Ezekiel's vision of the restored land of Israel \(Ezek 47:16\). It was located on the ideal northern border of the land, between the territories of Damascus and Hamath. The context suggests that Hazer-hatticon is another name for Hazar-enan, a town also mentioned in the description of Israel's borders \(Num 34:9-10\). Its exact location is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the region of modern-day Lebanon or Syria.
