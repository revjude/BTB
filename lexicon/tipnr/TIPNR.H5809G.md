Azzur is listed in [[Neh.10.17|Nehemiah 10:17]] as one of the leaders of the people who sealed the covenant made in the time of Nehemiah. After the Israelites had returned from exile in Babylon and rebuilt the wall of Jerusalem, they gathered to confess their sins and commit to obeying God's law. Nehemiah 10 records the names of those who signed this agreement, including leaders, priests, Levites, and others. Azzur's presence on this list indicates he held some position of authority and influence among the people. By sealing the covenant, he was pledging to uphold its commitments.
