Nun was an Israelite from the tribe of Ephraim, best known as the father of Joshua \([[Exod.33.11|Exodus 33:11]]\). His son Joshua was Moses' assistant from his youth \([[Num.11.28|Numbers 11:28]]\) and was chosen by God to succeed Moses as the leader of Israel \([[Num.27.18|Numbers 27:18]]; Deuteronomy 31:23\). Nun's name is often mentioned in connection with Joshua, emphasizing the importance of family lineage and the faithfulness passed down through generations. Joshua is referred to as "Joshua the son of Nun" throughout the Bible \(e.g., [[Num.14.6|Numbers 14:6]], 30; [[Josh.1.1|Joshua 1:1]]; 2:1\). As the father of a prominent leader, Nun's legacy was remembered long after his lifetime \([[1Kgs.16.34|1 Kings 16:34]]; [[Neh.8.17|Nehemiah 8:17]]\).
