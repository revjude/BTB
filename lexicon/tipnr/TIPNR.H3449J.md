Isshiah, also known as Jeshaiah, is mentioned in two passages in 1 Chronicles as a Levite who served during the reign of King David. In [[1Chr.24.21|1 Chronicles 24:21]], he is listed among the descendants of Rehabiah in the context of organizing the Levitical duties. 

In [[1Chr.26.25|1 Chronicles 26:25]], Isshiah \(Jeshaiah\) is mentioned as a relative of Shelomoth, who was in charge of the treasuries. The passage states that Shelomoth's relatives, including Jeshaiah, were also responsible for the treasuries. 

As a Levite, Isshiah \(Jeshaiah\) would have been involved in various aspects of worship and service in the tabernacle and later the temple. The Levites were responsible for assisting the priests, singing, playing musical instruments, and maintaining the sacred spaces. 

The variation in the spelling of his name \(Isshiah or Jeshaiah\) is not uncommon in biblical texts and may reflect differences in pronunciation or transcription over time. 

No other specific details are provided about Isshiah's \(Jeshaiah's\) life or role. His inclusion in these passages serves to highlight the importance of the Levites in the worship and service of God, as well as the organization and administration of sacred duties during David's reign.
