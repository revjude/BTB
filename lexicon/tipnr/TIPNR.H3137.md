Jokim is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.4.22|1 Chronicles 4:22]] as part of the genealogy of Judah, specifically within the lineage of Shelah, one of Judah's sons. The genealogy in this chapter traces the descendants of Judah, providing a record of the families and clans that comprised this important tribe in Israel. 

Jokim is listed along with several other names, including Jozeh and the men of Cozeba, as well as Joash and Saraph, who are described as having "dominion in Moab" and "Jashubi-lehem." The exact nature of their dominion and the meaning of "Jashubi-lehem" are unclear from the text. 

No further details are provided about Jokim's life, his specific place within the family lineage, or any notable achievements. His mention in the genealogy serves primarily to document the continuity of Judah's descendants and to highlight the significance of the tribe in the history of Israel. 

The inclusion of these names and the reference to their dominion in Moab may also suggest that some members of Judah's lineage had connections or influence beyond the borders of Israel. However, without additional context, the implications of these details remain uncertain.
