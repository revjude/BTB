The plains of Moab refer to the region east of the Jordan River, opposite Jericho, where the Israelites camped before entering the Promised Land. This area is mentioned several times in the books of Numbers, Deuteronomy, and Joshua \([[Num.22.1|Num.22.1]]; 26:3, 63; 31:12; 33:48-50; 35:1; 36:13; Deut 34:1, 8; Josh 13:32\). It was in the plains of Moab that the Israelites received instructions from Moses regarding the division of the land, the appointment of cities for the Levites and cities of refuge, and various laws and ordinances. Moses also delivered his final discourses to the Israelites in this location before his death on Mount Nebo, which overlooked the plains of Moab. The region was previously occupied by the Moabites, hence the name, but was conquered by the Amorites before the arrival of the Israelites.
