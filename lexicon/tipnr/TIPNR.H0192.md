Evil-merodach was a king of Babylon who reigned from 562 to 560 BC. He was the son and successor of Nebuchadnezzar II, the Babylonian king who had conquered Judah and destroyed Jerusalem. In the 37th year of the exile of Jehoiachin, the former king of Judah, Evil-merodach showed him kindness by releasing him from prison \([[2Kgs.25.27|2 Kings 25:27]]; [[Jer.52.31|Jeremiah 52:31]]\). He spoke kindly to Jehoiachin and gave him a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon \(2 Kings 25:28; Jeremiah 52:32\). Evil-merodach also provided Jehoiachin with regular food allowances for the rest of his life \(2 Kings 25:29-30; Jeremiah 52:33-34\). This act of mercy toward the exiled king of Judah is the only event recorded in the Bible about Evil-merodach's reign.
