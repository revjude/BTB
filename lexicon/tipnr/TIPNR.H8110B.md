He is listed among the 70 members of Jacob's family who migrated to Egypt during the time of Joseph. Shimron became the progenitor of the Shimronite clan within the tribe of Issachar. In the census taken in the wilderness of Sinai \([[Num.26.24|Numbers 26:24]]\), the descendants of Shimron, known as the Shimronites, were counted among the clans of Issachar. This census was conducted to determine the military strength and organization of the Israelites before their entry into the Promised Land.
