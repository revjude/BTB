Sheba, mentioned in [[Gen.10.28|Genesis 10:28]] and [[1Chr.1.22|1 Chronicles 1:22]], was a descendant of Joktan, who was a descendant of Shem, one of Noah's sons. Joktan's descendants are associated with the peoples and tribes of southern Arabia. Sheba, in particular, is linked to the ancient kingdom of Sheba, located in the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula, in modern-day Yemen. The Sabeans, the inhabitants of Sheba, were renowned for their wealth, trade in spices, gold, and precious stones, and their influential position in the ancient Near Eastern trade network. The connection between Sheba, the descendant of Joktan, and the kingdom of Sheba suggests that the Joktanites may have been among the early settlers and founders of this prosperous kingdom. The mention of Sheba in the Table of Nations \(Genesis 10\) and the genealogy in 1 Chronicles highlights the spread and distribution of the descendants of Noah's sons after the Flood and their role in populating various regions of the ancient world.
