- A priest living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[2Tim.4.14|Act.4.6]]; called Alexander  **<big>[[G0223|Ἀλέξανδρος]]</big>**

Alexander is mentioned in the Book of Acts as a member of the high-priestly family in Jerusalem. He was present when Peter and John were brought before the Sanhedrin, the Jewish high court, after healing a lame man and preaching in the Temple. \(Act.4.1-6\) 

The Sanhedrin, led by the high priest Annas and his family, questioned Peter and John about the power and authority by which they had performed the healing and preached to the people. \(Act.4.7\) 

Alexander's presence among the high-priestly family suggests that he held a position of influence and authority within the religious establishment of Jerusalem. The high-priestly family, along with the Sadducees, represented the religious and political elite of the Jewish society. 

Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, boldly proclaimed that the healing was done through the name of Jesus Christ, whom the religious leaders had crucified but whom God had raised from the dead. \(Act.4.8-12\) 

The Sanhedrin, recognizing the boldness of Peter and John and the undeniable miracle that had taken place, could not find a way to punish them. Instead, they warned the apostles not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus and released them. \(Act.4.13-22\) 

Alexander's role in this event is not explicitly described, but his presence among the high-priestly family indicates his involvement in the religious and political affairs of Jerusalem, particularly in the opposition to the early Christian movement.
