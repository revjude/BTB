Jozabad is mentioned in [[1Chr.12.4|1 Chronicles 12:4]] as one of the Benjamite warriors who joined David at Ziklag. The context of the passage is the listing of the mighty men who supported David during his time of exile and conflict with King Saul \(1 Chronicles 12:1-22\). 

Jozabad, along with other Benjamite warriors such as Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, joined David at Ziklag while David was still a fugitive from Saul \(1 Chronicles 12:1-4\). These men were described as brave warriors, trained for battle and skilled with the bow, and able to shoot arrows and sling stones with either the right or left hand \(1 Chronicles 12:2\). 

The passage highlights the support David received from various tribes, including Benjamin, Saul's own tribe \(1 Chronicles 12:29\).
