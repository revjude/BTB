Jeberechiah is mentioned in [[Isa.8.2|Isaiah 8:2]] as one of the reliable witnesses called by the prophet Isaiah to attest to his prophecy concerning his son Maher-shalal-hash-baz. The name Maher-shalal-hash-baz means "swift is the booty, speedy is the prey," and was given as a sign of the impending Assyrian invasion and conquest of Damascus and Samaria. Isaiah was instructed to write this name on a large scroll and have it confirmed by reliable witnesses, including Jeberechiah and Uriah the priest. The presence of these witnesses served to validate the prophecy and emphasize its importance.
