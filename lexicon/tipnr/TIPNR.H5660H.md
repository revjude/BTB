Abdi is mentioned in [[2Chr.29.12|2 Chronicles 29:12]] as a Levite who served during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. He was the father of Kish, another Levite who participated in the purification of the temple ordered by Hezekiah. As part of Hezekiah's reforms, the Levites were tasked with cleansing the temple and restoring proper worship practices. Abdi's mention in this context suggests that he and his family played a role in supporting Hezekiah's religious reforms.
