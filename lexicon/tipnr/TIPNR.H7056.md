Kamon is a city mentioned in the Bible as the burial place of Jair, who judged Israel for twenty-two years \(Judges 10:3-5\). The city was located in the region of Gilead, east of the Jordan River, but its exact location is uncertain. Some scholars propose that Kamon may be identified with the ruins of Qamm, southeast of the Sea of Galilee, or Qumeim, east-northeast of Irbid in modern-day Jordan.
