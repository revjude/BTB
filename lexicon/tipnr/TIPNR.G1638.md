The Mount of Olives is a mountain ridge located east of Jerusalem, separated from the city by the Kidron Valley. It is mentioned frequently in the Bible, especially in connection with the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus often visited the Mount of Olives \([[Luke.21.37|Luke 21:37]]; 22:39; [[John.8.1|John 8:1]]\), and it was the site of many significant events, including His triumphal entry into Jerusalem \(Matt. 21:1; [[Mark.11.1|Mark 11:1]]; [[Luke.19.29|Luke 19:29]], 37\), His prophetic discourse about the destruction of Jerusalem and His second coming \(Matt. 24:3; [[Mark.13.3|Mark 13:3]]\), His agonizing prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane \(Matt. 26:30; [[Mark.14.26|Mark 14:26]]; [[Luke.22.39|Luke 22:39]]\), and His ascension into heaven \(Luke 24:50-51; Acts 1:12\). 

The Mount of Olives also held significance in the Old Testament. King David fled from Jerusalem via the Mount of Olives during Absalom's rebellion \(2 Sam. 15:30\). The prophet Zechariah foretold that the Messiah would stand on the Mount of Olives when He comes to establish His kingdom on earth \(Zech. 14:4\).
