Elidad, the son of Chislon, is mentioned in [[Num.34.21|Numbers 34:21]] as the leader chosen from the tribe of Benjamin to assist in dividing the Promised Land. After the Israelites had conquered the land of Canaan, God instructed Moses to appoint leaders from each tribe to help divide the land as an inheritance among the tribes \(Numbers 34:16-29\). Elidad was selected as the representative from the tribe of Benjamin. His role, along with the other appointed leaders, was to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of the land based on the size of each tribe. Elidad's appointment demonstrates the importance of tribal representation and organization in the allocation of the Promised Land.
