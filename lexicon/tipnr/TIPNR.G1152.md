- A woman living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Esth.9.7|Act.17.34]]; 
- only referred to as Damaris<[[G1152]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Δάμαρις</span>\).

Damaris is mentioned in Acts 17:34 as one of the people who believed Paul's message when he preached at the Areopagus in Athens. After hearing Paul's discourse on the "Unknown God" and the resurrection of Jesus, some of the Athenians mocked him, while others expressed interest in hearing more. 

Among those who joined Paul and believed were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris. The fact that Damaris is specifically named alongside Dionysius suggests that she was a person of some prominence or significance in the Athenian society. 

No further details about Damaris' life, background, or role in the early church are provided in the biblical text. However, her conversion is an example of how Paul's message reached people from various backgrounds, including women, and how the gospel spread in the intellectual and philosophical center of Athens.
