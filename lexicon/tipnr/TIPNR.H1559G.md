Levite living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Galal</span>, a Levite musician and descendant of Asaph, lived in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile.
- A man from the tribe of Levi  living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[1Chr.9.15|1Ch.9.15]]; 
- only referred to as Galal **<big>[[H1559|גָּלָל]]</big>**.

Galal is mentioned in [[1Chr.9.15|1 Chronicles 9:15]] as one of the Levites who lived in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. He was a descendant of Asaph, one of the chief musicians appointed by David to lead worship in the temple \(1 Chronicles 6:39\). Galal's inclusion in this list suggests that he, like his ancestor Asaph, was a skilled musician who served in the temple. The Levites were responsible for various duties in the temple, including music, singing, and assisting the priests \(1 Chronicles 23:28-32\). The mention of Galal and other Levites living in Jerusalem after the exile demonstrates the importance of restoring worship and maintaining the temple services as the Jewish community rebuilt their lives in the land.
