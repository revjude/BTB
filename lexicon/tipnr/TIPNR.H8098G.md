Shemaiah was a Levite who lived during the reign of King David. He is mentioned in [[1Chr.15.8|1 Chronicles 15:8]] as one of the sons of Elizaphan, a descendant of Kohath. When David gathered the Levites to bring the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem, Shemaiah was among those chosen for this task \([[1Chr.15.11|1 Chronicles 15:11]]\). The Levites were to carry the ark on their shoulders using the poles, as prescribed by the Law of Moses. Shemaiah's specific role in the procession is not mentioned, but his participation highlights the importance of the Levites in the proper handling and transportation of the sacred ark.
