Dinah was the daughter of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and Leah, born after six sons \([[Gen.30.21|Genesis 30:21]]\). She is most prominently featured in Genesis 34, which recounts a tragic event that had far-reaching consequences for her family and the inhabitants of Shechem. 

When Dinah went out to visit the women of the land, Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, saw her and raped her \([[Gen.34.1|Genesis 34:1]]-2\). Despite this violation, Shechem became deeply attracted to Dinah and sought to marry her \([[Gen.34.3|Genesis 34:3]]-4\). 

Jacob learned of the incident but remained silent until his sons returned from tending the livestock \([[Gen.34.5|Genesis 34:5]]\). Hamor, Shechem's father, approached Jacob to arrange a marriage between Shechem and Dinah, proposing intermarriage and trade between their peoples \(Genesis 34:6-10\). 

Dinah's brothers, however, were filled with grief and fury over the defilement of their sister \(Genesis 34:7\). They deceitfully agreed to the marriage on the condition that all the men of Shechem be circumcised \([[Gen.34.1|Genesis 34:1]]3-17\). The Shechemites agreed, and all the men of the city were circumcised \([[Gen.34.1|Genesis 34:1]]8-24\). 

Three days later, while the men of Shechem were still in pain, Simeon and Levi, two of Dinah's brothers, attacked the city, killed all the males, plundered the city, and took Dinah back \([[Gen.34.25|Genesis 34:25]]-29\). This action troubled Jacob, who feared retaliation from the surrounding peoples \([[Gen.34.3|Genesis 34:3]]0\). 

Dinah is later mentioned in the listing of Jacob's descendants who went to Egypt during the famine \([[Gen.46.15|Genesis 46:15]]\). Her story serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of sexual violence and the dangers of deceit and revenge.
