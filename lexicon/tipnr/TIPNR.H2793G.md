Horesh was a wilderness area in Judah where David sought refuge from King Saul \([[1Sam.23.15|1 Samuel 23:15]]-19\). While David was in the wilderness of Ziph, he learned that Saul was pursuing him. Jonathan, Saul's son and David's friend, visited David at Horesh and encouraged him, affirming that David would become the next king of Israel. The Ziphites later informed Saul of David's location, but David escaped before Saul could capture him. The exact location of Horesh is not specified, but it was likely in the vicinity of Ziph, southeast of Hebron.
