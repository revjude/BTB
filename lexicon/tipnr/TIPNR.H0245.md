Azaniah is mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as one of the Levites who sealed the covenant during the time of Nehemiah's religious and social reforms in Jerusalem. In Nehemiah 10, a list is given of the priests, Levites, and leaders who signed the covenant, pledging to follow the Law of God and to support the temple and its services. Azaniah is listed among the Levites who participated in this solemn act of commitment. The signing of the covenant was a significant event in the history of Israel, marking a renewed dedication to God and His laws after the return from Babylonian exile. As a Levite, Azaniah would have had specific responsibilities related to the temple and the religious life of the community.
