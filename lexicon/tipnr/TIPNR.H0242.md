Uzzen-sheerah is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.7.24|1 Chronicles 7:24]] as a town built by Sheerah, the daughter of Ephraim. The passage states that Sheerah built the towns of Upper and Lower Beth-horon, as well as Uzzen-sheerah. This information is provided in the context of the genealogy of the tribe of Ephraim, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The name "Uzzen-sheerah" likely means "the ear of Sheerah," possibly referring to a geographical feature or a place named in honor of Sheerah. The exact location of Uzzen-sheerah is not specified in the Bible, but it was probably situated in the territory allocated to the tribe of Ephraim, in the central region of Canaan. The mention of Sheerah as the builder of these towns is notable, as it is unusual for women to be credited with such accomplishments in the biblical record. This brief reference to Uzzen-sheerah provides insight into the development and settlement of the land by the Israelites following their conquest of Canaan.
