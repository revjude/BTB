En-gannim, also known as Anem, was a city allotted to the tribe of Issachar during the division of the Promised Land \([[Josh.19.21|Joshua 19:21]]\). Later, it was designated as one of the cities given to the Levites, specifically to the Gershonite clan \([[Josh.21.29|Joshua 21:29]]; [[1Chr.6.73|1 Chronicles 6:73]]\). 

The Levites, who were not given a specific territory, were distributed among the other tribes and given cities to live in, along with pasturelands for their flocks. En-gannim was one of these Levitical cities within Issachar's territory. 

The name En-gannim means "spring of the gardens," indicating the presence of a water source and fertile land. The alternate name Anem, used in [[1Chr.6.73|1 Chronicles 6:73]], may be a variant spelling or a scribal error. 

Apart from its allocation to Issachar and its designation as a Levitical city, no other events or details about En-gannim \(or Anem\) are recorded in the Bible. Its exact location is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the region of Issachar, in the northern part of Israel.
