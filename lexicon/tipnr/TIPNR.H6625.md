- People from Pathrus\(?\) of the Egyptians, first mentioned at [[Gen.10.14|Gen.10.14]]; 
- only referred to as Pathrusim **<big>[[H6625|פַּתְרֻסִי]]</big>**; 
- descended from Egypt **<big>[[H4714|מִצְרַיִם]]</big>** along with Ludim **<big>[[H3866|לוּדִי]]</big>**, Anamim **<big>[[H6047|עֲנָמִים]]</big>**, Lehabim **<big>[[H3853|לְהָבִים]]</big>**, Naphtuhim **<big>[[H5320|נַפְתֻּחִים]]</big>**, Casluhim **<big>[[H3695|כַּסְלֻחִים]]</big>** and Caphtorim **<big>[[H3732|כַּפְתֹּרִי]]</big>**.

The Pathrusim were a people group listed among the descendants of Mizraim, son of Ham, in [[Gen.10.14|Genesis 10:14]] and [[1Chr.1.12|1 Chronicles 1:12]]. Mizraim was the ancestor of the Egyptians and other related peoples. The Pathrusim are mentioned only in these genealogical lists and are not referred to elsewhere in the Bible. They were probably inhabitants of the region of Pathros in Upper Egypt, which is mentioned several times in the prophets as a place where Jews had settled \(Isaiah 11:11; Jeremiah 44:1,15; Ezekiel 29:14; 30:14\).
