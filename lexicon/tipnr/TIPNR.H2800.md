Harosheth-hagoyim was a Canaanite city that served as the headquarters for Sisera, the commander of the army of Jabin, the king of Hazor \(Judg 4:2\). Sisera gathered his 900 iron chariots and troops at Harosheth-hagoyim before engaging the Israelites led by Deborah and Barak at the Kishon River \(Judg 4:13\). After the Canaanites were defeated, Barak pursued them back to Harosheth-hagoyim and destroyed Sisera's army \(Judg 4:16\). The exact location of this city is uncertain, though some scholars propose it may have been near modern-day Tel Harashim in the Jezreel Valley.
