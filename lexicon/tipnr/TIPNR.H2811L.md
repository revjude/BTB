Hashabiah was a Levite leader during the reign of King Josiah of Judah. He, along with Jeiel and Jozabad, gave a large number of animals for sacrifices during Josiah's Passover celebration. This celebration was a significant event in Josiah's religious reforms, which aimed to restore proper worship of the Lord in Judah. Hashabiah's contribution demonstrates his support for these reforms and his dedication to the proper observance of the Passover. \([[2Chr.35.9|2Ch.35.9]]\).
