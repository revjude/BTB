Darius the Mede is mentioned in the Book of Daniel as the ruler who took over the Babylonian kingdom after the fall of Babylon to the Medo-Persian Empire. He is first introduced in [[Dan.5.31|Daniel 5:31]], which states that Darius the Mede received the kingdom at the age of sixty-two. 

In Daniel 6, Darius is portrayed as the king who was manipulated by his officials into issuing a decree that prohibited prayer to anyone but him for thirty days. This decree led to Daniel being thrown into the lions' den when he was caught praying to God. However, God protected Daniel, and Darius, upon discovering Daniel's miraculous survival, issued a new decree acknowledging the power of Daniel's God \([[Dan.6.25|Daniel 6:25]]-28\). 

Darius is also mentioned in [[Dan.9.1|Daniel 9:1]], which sets the context for Daniel's prayer of confession and supplication for his people. The chapter begins by stating that this event took place in the first year of Darius' reign. 

In [[Dan.11.1|Daniel 11:1]], an angelic messenger refers to the first year of Darius the Mede, indicating that he had been supporting and protecting the prince of Persia. 

The identity of Darius the Mede has been a subject of debate among scholars, as there is no clear historical record of a Median king ruling Babylon between the reigns of Belshazzar and Cyrus the Great. Some scholars suggest that Darius may have been a subordinate ruler or a governor under Cyrus, while others propose that the name may be a title or a reference to Cyrus himself. Despite the uncertainty surrounding his identity, the biblical account presents Darius the Mede as a significant figure in the early days of the Medo-Persian Empire and in the life of Daniel.
