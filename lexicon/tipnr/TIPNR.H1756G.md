Dor, also referred to as Naphath-dor, was a Canaanite city located on the Mediterranean coast, south of Mount Carmel. It was one of the cities conquered by Joshua during the Israelite conquest of Canaan \([[Josh.12.23|Joshua 12:23]]\) and was allotted to the tribe of Manasseh as part of their inheritance \([[Josh.17.11|Joshua 17:11]]; [[1Chr.7.29|1 Chronicles 7:29]]\). However, the Manassites were unable to drive out the Canaanite inhabitants of Dor, and the city remained under Canaanite control \([[Judg.1.27|Judges 1:27]]\). During the reign of Solomon, Dor was included in the administrative district governed by Ben-abinadab, one of Solomon's officers \([[1Kgs.4.11|1 Kings 4:11]]\). The city was known for its strategic location and its involvement in maritime trade. Archaeological excavations at Tel Dor have revealed evidence of the city's long history and its importance as a port city in ancient times.
