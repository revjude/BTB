Gamaliel, the son of Pedahzur, was the leader of the tribe of Manasseh during the Israelites' journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. He is mentioned several times in the book of Numbers. In [[Num.1.10|Numbers 1:10]], Gamaliel is listed as the leader of Manasseh in the census taken at the beginning of the second year after the Exodus. The tribe of Manasseh, under Gamaliel's leadership, was counted as part of the larger Israelite community \(Numbers 1:34-35\). In the arrangement of the Israelite camp, Gamaliel and the tribe of Manasseh were positioned on the west side of the tabernacle, along with the tribes of Ephraim and Benjamin \([[Num.2.20|Numbers 2:20]]\). Gamaliel also had a role in the offerings presented at the dedication of the tabernacle. He brought his offering on the eighth day, which included various animals and vessels for the tabernacle service \([[Num.7.54|Numbers 7:54]]-59\). When the Israelites set out from Mount Sinai, Gamaliel and the tribe of Manasseh marched under their standard, as directed by God \([[Num.10.23|Numbers 10:23]]\). These references to Gamaliel highlight his leadership role and the importance of the tribe of Manasseh in the organization and journey of the Israelites through the wilderness.
