The genealogy in this chapter traces the descendants of Reuben and highlights some of the notable figures within the tribe. Azaz's mention in this context suggests that he was an ancestor of significant individuals within the tribe of Reuben.

They were known for their military prowess and played a role in the defense of Israel's borders.
