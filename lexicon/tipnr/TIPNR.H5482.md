Syene is mentioned in the Bible as the southern border of Egypt \(Ezek. 29:10; 30:6\). It is used in prophetic passages to describe the extent of God's judgment on Egypt, from Migdol in the north to Syene in the south. Syene is also mentioned in [[Isa.49.12|Isaiah 49:12]] as one of the distant places from which people will come to worship the Lord. The city was located on the Nile River at the first cataract, marking the traditional southern boundary of Egypt. It is known today as Aswan, and its strategic location made it an important frontier town and trading center in ancient times.
