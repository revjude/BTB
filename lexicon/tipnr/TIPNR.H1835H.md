Dan was the fifth son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and the firstborn of Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant. His birth is recorded in [[Gen.30.6|Genesis 30:6]], where Rachel, who had been unable to conceive, gave Bilhah to Jacob as a wife to bear children on her behalf. When Bilhah gave birth to a son, Rachel named him Dan, saying, "God has vindicated me; he has listened to my plea and given me a son." 

As one of Israel's twelve sons, Dan became the founder of the Israelite tribe bearing his name. In [[Gen.46.23|Genesis 46:23]], when Israel and his family moved to Egypt, Dan's son Hushim is mentioned as part of the household. 

In Israel's blessing to his sons before his death \([[Gen.49.16|Genesis 49:16]]-17\), Dan is described as one who will provide justice for his people as one of the tribes of Israel. Jacob also compares Dan to a serpent by the roadside, an adder along the path, foreshadowing the tribe's future role in the Promised Land. 

The tribe of Dan was allocated territory in the northern part of Canaan during the conquest under Joshua. However, they later migrated northward and settled in the city of Laish, which they renamed Dan \(Judges 18\). 

In [[1Chr.2.2|1 Chronicles 2:2]], Dan is listed among the twelve tribes of Israel, confirming his status as one of the founding fathers of the nation. Throughout the Old Testament, the tribe of Dan is mentioned alongside the other Israelite tribes, although they are sometimes associated with idolatry and apostasy.
