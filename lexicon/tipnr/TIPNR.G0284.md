Amminadab was a prominent figure in the genealogy of the Israelites. He was the father of Elisheba, who married Aaron, the first high priest of Israel. Amminadab's son Nahshon was a leader of the tribe of Judah during the wilderness wanderings. Nahshon was in charge of the Judahite division and made offerings at the dedication of the tabernacle. 

Amminadab is also mentioned in the genealogy of King David, being his great-great-grandfather. This makes Amminadab an ancestor of Jesus Christ as well, as seen in the genealogies recorded in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. 

The consistency of Amminadab's mention in various genealogical records highlights his significance in the lineage of important biblical figures, from the time of Moses to the earthly life of Jesus.
