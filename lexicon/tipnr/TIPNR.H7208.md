- A woman living at the time of the Patriarchs, only mentioned at [[Gen.22.24|Gen.22.24]]; 
- only referred to as Reumah<[[H7208]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>או</span>ּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>מ</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>\); 
-  mother of Tebah<[[H2875]]>, Gaham<[[H1514]]>, Tahash<[[H8477]]> and Maacah<[[H4601G]]>.

Reumah is mentioned in [[Gen.22.24|Genesis 22:24]] as the concubine of Nahor, Abraham's brother. Nahor was the grandfather of Rebekah, who would later become the wife of Isaac, Abraham's son \(Genesis 24:15, 24\). Reumah bore four sons to Nahor: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah. This information is provided in the context of listing Nahor's descendants, which include both the children of his wife, Milcah, and those of his concubine, Reumah. In ancient Near Eastern culture, it was not uncommon for men to have both wives and concubines. Concubines held a lower social status than wives but were still considered a part of the family. The mention of Reumah and her sons in the genealogy of Nahor shows the breadth of his family and the various branches that would have descended from him. It also provides background information on the extended family of Abraham and the relatives of Rebekah, who would become an important figure in the history of Israel.
