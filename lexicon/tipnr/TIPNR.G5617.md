Hosea was one of the minor prophets in the Old Testament who prophesied to the northern kingdom of Israel during the 8th century BC. He is the author of the book that bears his name. 

The opening verse of the book of Hosea \([[Hos.1.1|Hosea 1:1]]\) provides the historical context of his ministry, stating that he prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the reign of Jeroboam II, king of Israel. 

Hosea's prophetic ministry was characterized by his unique personal life, which served as a symbolic representation of God's relationship with Israel. In Hosea 1:2, God commanded Hosea to marry a promiscuous woman named Gomer, who would be unfaithful to him. This marriage symbolized Israel's unfaithfulness to God and their spiritual adultery through idolatry. 

Throughout the book, Hosea confronts Israel's sin, including their idolatry, social injustice, and political corruption. He calls the people to repent and return to God, emphasizing God's steadfast love and desire to restore His relationship with them. 

In [[Rom.9.25|Romans 9:25]], the Apostle Paul quotes from Hosea 2:23, applying the prophet's words to the inclusion of the Gentiles in God's plan of salvation. This demonstrates the enduring significance of Hosea's message, which extends beyond the immediate context of Israel to the universal scope of God's love and redemption.
