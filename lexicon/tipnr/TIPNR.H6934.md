- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.40|Ezr.2.40]];

Kadmiel is mentioned several times in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah as a Levite who returned from the Babylonian exile. He is first listed among the Levites who returned with Zerubbabel \([[Ezra.2.40|Ezra 2:40]]; [[Neh.7.43|Nehemiah 7:43]]\). 

During the rebuilding of the temple, Kadmiel, along with Jeshua and his sons and brothers, led the Levites in supervising the workmen \([[Ezra.3.9|Ezra 3:9]]\). This highlights Kadmiel's leadership role and his involvement in the restoration of the temple. 

Later, Kadmiel is mentioned among the Levites who participated in the public reading of the Law and the confession of sins during the time of Ezra and Nehemiah \([[Neh.9.4|Nehemiah 9:4]]-5\). He also signed the covenant to follow the Law of God \([[Neh.10.9|Nehemiah 10:9]]\). 

In the lists of Levites who served in the temple after its completion, Kadmiel is mentioned as one of the leaders of thanksgiving and praise \([[Neh.12.8|Nehemiah 12:8]], 24\). 

Throughout these passages, Kadmiel emerges as a prominent Levite who played a significant role in the rebuilding of the temple, the spiritual renewal of the people, and the restoration of worship in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. His consistent presence and leadership demonstrate his dedication to serving God and his people.
