- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.7.7|Neh.7.7]]; 
- only referred to as Nahamani **<big>[[H5167|נַחֲמָנִי]]</big>**.

Nahamani is mentioned in [[Neh.7.7|Nehemiah 7:7]] as one of the individuals who returned to Jerusalem from Babylonian captivity along with Zerubbabel. This event marked a significant moment in Jewish history, as the exiles were allowed to return to their homeland and rebuild the temple in Jerusalem following the decree of King Cyrus of Persia. 

The list in Nehemiah 7 records the names of the men who led the first group of returning exiles. Nahamani's inclusion in this list suggests that he held a position of some importance or responsibility among the returnees. However, beyond his name and his participation in the return from exile, no additional information is provided about Nahamani's background, family, or specific role in the community. 

The return of Nahamani and the other exiles was a pivotal step in the restoration of Jewish religious and cultural identity in their homeland. The rebuilding of the temple and the city of Jerusalem was a crucial task that lay ahead of them, and the leadership and dedication of individuals like Nahamani were essential to the success of this endeavor. 

Nahamani's presence in the list of returnees serves as a testament to the resilience and faith of the Jewish people, who had endured decades of captivity in Babylon and yet remained committed to their God and their ancestral homeland.
