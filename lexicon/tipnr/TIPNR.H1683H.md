Deborah was a prophetess and the only female judge mentioned in the Bible. She lived during a time when the Israelites were oppressed by Jabin, the king of Canaan \([[Judg.4.4|Judges 4:4]]\). Deborah held court under a palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, where the Israelites came to her for judgment \([[Judg.4.5|Judges 4:5]]\). 

Deborah summoned Barak, an Israelite warrior, and delivered a message from God instructing him to lead an army against Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army \(Judges 4:6-7\). Barak agreed to go only if Deborah accompanied him, to which she consented but prophesied that the honor of the victory would go to a woman \(Judges 4:8-9\). 

Deborah and Barak led the Israelite army to Mount Tabor, where they defeated Sisera's forces \([[Judg.4.10|Judges 4:10]]-16\). Sisera fled and sought refuge in the tent of Jael, who killed him by driving a tent peg through his temple \(Judges 4:17-22\). 

After the victory, Deborah and Barak sang a song of praise, recounting the events of the battle and celebrating God's deliverance \([[Judg.5.1|Judges 5:1]]-31\). Deborah's leadership as a prophetess and judge brought 40 years of peace to the land of Israel \(Judges 5:31\).
