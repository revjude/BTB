<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Adnah</span> was one of the Manassite leaders who defected to David at Ziklag while he was hiding from Saul.
- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.12.20|1Ch.12.20]]; 
- only referred to as Adnah<[[H5734G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>\).

Adnah is mentioned in [[1Chr.12.20|1 Chronicles 12:20]] as one of the Manassite leaders who joined David at Ziklag when he was seeking refuge from King Saul. Along with other warriors from the tribes of Benjamin and Judah, these Manassites defected to David and provided him with military support. 

The context of 1 Chronicles 12 describes the various groups of warriors who aligned themselves with David during his time of exile and his rise to power. These men were skilled in battle and loyal to David, recognizing him as the chosen leader of Israel. 

Adnah's defection to David, along with the other Manassite leaders, demonstrates the growing support for David as the future king, even among the northern tribes. It also highlights David's ability to attract and inspire loyalty from a diverse group of warriors. 

Apart from being listed as one of the Manassite leaders who joined David at Ziklag, no other information is provided about Adnah's background, family, or personal exploits.
