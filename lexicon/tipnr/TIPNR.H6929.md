Kedemah is mentioned in [[Gen.25.15|Genesis 25:15]] and [[1Chr.1.31|1 Chronicles 1:31]] as one of the twelve sons of Ishmael, the son of Abraham. He is listed along with his brothers as the ancestors of the twelve tribes of Ishmael. 

Apart from these genealogical mentions, no further information is provided about Kedemah's life or the specific tribe that descended from him. 

Nodab, on the other hand, is mentioned in [[1Chr.5.19|1 Chronicles 5:19]] as one of the Hagrite tribes that the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh fought against during the days of Saul. The Israelite tribes defeated the Hagrites and took captive their livestock and tents. 

The Hagrites were a nomadic people who lived in the region east of Gilead. The mention of Nodab alongside the Hagrites suggests that they were likely a subgroup or an allied tribe of the Hagrites. 

Apart from this brief mention in the context of the Israelite tribes' victory over the Hagrites, no other information is provided about the Nodab tribe in the Bible.
