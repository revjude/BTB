Baalis was the king of the Ammonites during the time of the Babylonian exile. He is mentioned in [[Jer.40.14|Jeremiah 40:14]] in connection with a plot to assassinate Gedaliah, the governor appointed by the Babylonians over the remnant of Judah. According to the text, Johanan warned Gedaliah that Baalis had sent a man named Ishmael to kill him. Gedaliah did not believe the warning and was subsequently murdered by Ishmael, causing the remaining Jews to flee to Egypt out of fear. This incident reveals that Baalis was opposed to the Babylonian-appointed governor and was willing to use violence to disrupt the fragile peace in Judah after the exile. The Ammonites, led by Baalis, were long-time enemies of Israel and may have seen Judah's weakened state as an opportunity to gain power in the region.
