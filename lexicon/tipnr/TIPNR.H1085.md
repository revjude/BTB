- A man living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Job.2.11|Job.2.11]]; 
- only referred to as Bildad **<big>[[H1085|בִּלְדַּד]]</big>**.

Bildad the Shuhite was one of the three friends who came to comfort Job during his time of intense suffering \([[Job.2.11|Job 2:11]]\). Along with Eliphaz the Temanite and Zophar the Naamathite, Bildad engaged in a series of dialogues with Job, attempting to explain the cause of his afflictions and offering advice. Bildad's speeches emphasize the justice and righteousness of God, suggesting that Job's suffering must be a result of his sin \([[Job.8.1|Job 8:1]]-22; 18:1-21; 25:1-6\). He argues that God does not pervert justice and that if Job were to seek God and plead for mercy, he would be restored if he were truly pure and upright \(Job 8:5-7\). However, like the other friends, Bildad fails to grasp the true reason behind Job's suffering and mistakenly accuses him of wrongdoing. In the end, God rebukes Bildad and the other friends for not speaking what is right about Him, unlike Job \(Job 42:7-9\). Despite his misguided attempts to explain Job's situation, Bildad's presence and dialogue with Job highlight the complexities of human suffering and the importance of faith in the face of adversity.
