Zebadiah was a Levite who lived during the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah. As part of Jehoshaphat's reforms, he sent out Levites and priests to teach the Book of the Law to the people throughout the cities of Judah. Zebadiah was among the Levites chosen for this task, along with Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah. They were accompanied by the priests Elishama and Jehoram. This educational initiative aimed to instruct the people in the ways of the Lord and strengthen their faith. Zebadiah's participation in this mission highlights the importance of the Levites' role in teaching and preserving the Law.
