- A woman living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Ezra.4.7|Act.9.36]]; 
- referred to as Tabitha **<big>[[G5000|Ταβιθά]]</big>**, or Dorcas **<big>[[G1393|Δορκάς]]</big>**.

Tabitha, also known by her Greek name Dorcas, was a disciple who lived in Joppa. Acts 9:36 describes her as a woman full of good works and acts of charity. When she became ill and died, the disciples in Joppa sent for Peter, who was in nearby Lydda. They showed him the tunics and garments Dorcas had made for the widows while she was with them, attesting to her life of service. Peter sent everyone out of the room, knelt down, and prayed. Then he told Tabitha to arise, and she opened her eyes and sat up. Peter presented her alive to the saints and widows, and this miracle became known throughout Joppa, causing many to believe in the Lord. The name Tabitha in Aramaic and Dorcas in Greek both mean "gazelle." Tabitha is an example of a faithful disciple who was beloved for her practical service and generosity to those in need.
