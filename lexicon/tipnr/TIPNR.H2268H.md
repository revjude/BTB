- only referred to as Heber **<big>[[H2268|חֶבֶר]]</big>**; 
- husband of Jael **<big>[[H3278|יָעֵל]]</big>**.

Heber was a Kenite, a descendant of Moses' father-in-law, Hobab. He had separated from the other Kenites and pitched his tent in the plain of Zaanaim, near Kedesh. Heber had made peace with Jabin, the king of Hazor, who was oppressing Israel at that time. Heber's wife, Jael, played a significant role in the defeat of Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army. When Sisera fled from the battle and sought refuge in Jael's tent, she killed him by driving a tent peg through his temple while he slept. Jael's actions are praised in the Song of Deborah for bringing deliverance to Israel. \([[Judg.4.11|Jdg.4.11]],17; 5.24\).
