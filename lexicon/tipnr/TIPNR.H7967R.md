Shallum, mentioned in [[Jer.32.7|Jeremiah 32:7]], was the uncle of the prophet Jeremiah. He is identified as the father of Hanamel, who approached Jeremiah with an offer to buy a field in Anathoth, Jeremiah's hometown. This encounter occurred while Jeremiah was imprisoned in the court of the guard during the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah. The Lord had revealed to Jeremiah that Hanamel would come to him with this offer, and Jeremiah recognized it as a sign from God. Jeremiah purchased the field from Hanamel, following the proper legal procedures, as a symbol of God's promise that the Israelites would once again possess the land after the Babylonian exile. Shallum's mention in this context highlights the family connection between Jeremiah and Hanamel and provides the background for this prophetic act.
