- referred to as Sabtah or Sabta<[[H5454]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ס</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ת</span>ָּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>\);

Sabtah \(or Sabta\) is mentioned in [[Gen.10.7|Genesis 10:7]] and [[1Chr.1.9|1 Chronicles 1:9]] as one of the sons of Cush, who was a son of Ham. He is listed among the descendants of Noah's sons in the Table of Nations, which records the dispersal of people groups after the Flood \(Genesis 10:1-32\). The exact identity and location of the People from Sabtah are uncertain, but some scholars suggest a connection with the ancient city of Shabwah in present-day Yemen, which was an important center of trade in the region. Others propose a link with the ancient kingdom of Sabata, located in the southern Arabian Peninsula. However, these associations remain speculative due to the limited information provided in the biblical text. The inclusion of Sabtah in the Table of Nations highlights the diversity of peoples and nations that emerged from the descendants of Noah and their spread across the earth after the Flood.
