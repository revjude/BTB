People from Kadmon\(?\)

The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Kadmonites</span> were one of the Canaanite people groups living in the land promised to Abraham's descendants.
- People from Kadmon\(?\), only mentioned at [[Gen.15.19|Gen.15.19]]; 
- only referred to as Kadmonites **<big>[[H6935|קַדְמֹנִי]]</big>**.

The Kadmonites are mentioned in [[Gen.15.19|Genesis 15:19]] as one of the ten Canaanite people groups inhabiting the land that God promised to give to Abraham's descendants. The context of the passage is the Abrahamic Covenant, in which God makes a covenant with Abraham, promising him a land, descendants, and blessings \(Genesis 15:18-21\). 

The Kadmonites are listed alongside other Canaanite groups such as the Kenites, Kenizzites, Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites \([[Gen.15.19|Genesis 15:19]]-21\). These groups were the inhabitants of the land of Canaan prior to the Israelite conquest. 

Apart from this single mention in the list of Canaanite peoples, no further information is provided about the Kadmonites in the Bible. Their exact location, culture, and history remain unknown. 

The inclusion of the Kadmonites in the list of Canaanite peoples emphasizes the scope of the land promise given to Abraham and the challenges the Israelites would face in taking possession of the land. It also underscores the faithfulness of God in fulfilling His promises to Abraham, despite the presence of numerous Canaanite groups in the land.
