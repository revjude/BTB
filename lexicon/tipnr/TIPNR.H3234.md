Man living at the time of Divided Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Imna</span> was a descendant of Asher, mentioned in the genealogy of the tribe of Asher in 1 Chronicles.
- A man from the tribe of Asher living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.7.35|1Ch.7.35]]; 
- only referred to as Imna **<big>[[H3234|יִמְנָע]]</big>**; 
-  son of Hotham **<big>[[H2369|חוֹתָם]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Zophah **<big>[[H6690|צוֹפַח]]</big>**, Shelesh **<big>[[H8028|שֶׁלֶשׁ]]</big>** and Amal **<big>[[H6000|עָמָל]]</big>**.

Imna is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.7.35|1 Chronicles 7:35]] as one of the sons of Helem, who was a descendant of Asher. Asher was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, and the genealogy in 1 Chronicles 7 lists the descendants of this tribe. 

Imna is listed along with his brothers Zophah, Imna, Shelesh, and Amal. The mention of these names in the genealogical record suggests that they were significant figures within the tribe of Asher and that their lineage was considered important enough to be recorded. 

However, apart from this brief mention in the genealogy, no other details are provided about Imna's life, his role within the tribe, or any significant events or accomplishments associated with him. 

The genealogical records in Chronicles serve to establish the family lines and tribal affiliations of the Israelites, particularly in the post-exilic period when many of them were returning to their homeland and seeking to reestablish their identity as God's chosen people.
