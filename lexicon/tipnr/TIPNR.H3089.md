Jehosheba, also known as Jehoshabeath, was the daughter of King Jehoram of Judah and the sister of King Ahaziah. She was married to Jehoiada, the high priest. When Athaliah, Jehosheba's mother, attempted to kill all the royal heirs after Ahaziah's death, Jehosheba rescued the infant Joash, Ahaziah's son, and hid him in the temple for six years. Later, Jehoiada and Jehosheba orchestrated the coronation of Joash and the overthrow of Athaliah.
