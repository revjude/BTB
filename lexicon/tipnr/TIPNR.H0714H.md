Ard is mentioned in the book of Numbers as one of the descendants of Benjamin, the youngest son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\). In the census of the Israelites taken in the wilderness of Moab, near the end of their forty years of wandering, Ard is listed as a grandson of Benjamin through his son Bela \([[Num.26.40|Numbers 26:40]]\). 

The purpose of this census was to determine the military strength of each tribe and to prepare for the allocation of the Promised Land among the tribes. The mention of Ard in this context highlights the continuity of the Benjamite clan and their place within the nation of Israel as they prepared to enter and possess the land promised to their forefathers. 

This reference to Ard in the book of Numbers is consistent with his mention in the genealogy of Benjamin in Genesis 46:21, confirming his place in the family line. Apart from these two mentions, no further details about Ard's life or role within the tribe of Benjamin are provided in the biblical text.
