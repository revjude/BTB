Goiim, meaning "nations," appears in the Bible as a place name or a title. In [[Gen.14.1|Genesis 14:1]] and 14:9, Tidal is mentioned as the king of Goiim \(also spelled Goyim\). He was one of the four kings who fought against Chedorlaomer and his allies in the Battle of the Vale of Siddim. The exact location of Goiim is uncertain, but it is thought to refer to a region or a confederation of peoples, rather than a specific city or nation. In [[Josh.12.23|Joshua 12:23]], the king of Goiim in Gilgal is listed among the kings defeated by Joshua during the conquest of Canaan. This suggests that Goiim may have been a region or a group of people living in the area of Gilgal.
