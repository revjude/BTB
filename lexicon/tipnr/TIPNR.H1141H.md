Benaiah the Pirathonite is mentioned in [[2Sam.23.30|2 Samuel 23:30]] and [[1Chr.11.31|1 Chronicles 11:31]] as one of David's thirty mighty warriors. These men were known for their exceptional bravery, military skills, and loyalty to King David. Benaiah's inclusion in this elite group highlights his prowess as a warrior and his dedication to serving the king. In [[1Chr.27.14|1 Chronicles 27:14]], Benaiah is listed as the leader of the Ephraimites, one of the twelve divisions of David's army. Each division served the king for one month out of the year, and Benaiah's appointment as a leader demonstrates his leadership abilities and the trust placed in him by David. The fact that he hailed from Pirathon, a town in the territory of Ephraim, further underscores his connection to the tribe of Ephraim.
