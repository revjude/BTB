Mary was a woman from Bethany, the sister of Martha and Lazarus, and a close friend of Jesus. When Jesus visited their home, Mary sat at His feet, listening intently to His teachings, while her sister Martha was busy serving. When Martha complained that Mary was not helping, Jesus commended Mary for choosing the better part by focusing on His words \([[Luke.10.39|Luke 10:39]], 42\). After the death of Lazarus, Mary fell at Jesus' feet, expressing her grief and faith in Him. Jesus was deeply moved by her sorrow and wept with her before raising Lazarus from the dead \([[John.11.1|John 11:1]]-44\). Later, during a meal at their home, Mary took a pound of expensive perfume and anointed Jesus' feet, wiping them with her hair. This act of devotion and love was criticized by Judas Iscariot, but Jesus defended her, stating that she had anointed Him for His burial \([[John.12.3|John 12:3]]-8\).
