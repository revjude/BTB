Millo, also known as Akra, was a fortified structure in ancient Jerusalem, first mentioned during the reign of King David \([[2Sam.5.9|2 Samuel 5:9]]; [[1Chr.11.8|1 Chronicles 11:8]]\). The name "Millo" is derived from the Hebrew word "millu'," meaning "filling" or "terrace," while "Akra" comes from the Greek word for "citadel" or "stronghold." 

King Solomon further strengthened and expanded Millo as part of his building projects in Jerusalem \([[1Kgs.9.15|1 Kings 9:15]], 24\). The construction of Millo was a significant undertaking, requiring a large workforce and resources \([[1Kgs.11.27|1 Kings 11:27]]\). 

During the reign of King Hezekiah, Millo was repaired and fortified as part of the preparations for the Assyrian invasion \([[2Chr.32.5|2 Chronicles 32:5]]\). The "House of Millo" is mentioned in connection with the coronation of King Joash \(2 Kings 12:20\), suggesting that it may have served as a royal residence or an important administrative center. 

The exact location and nature of Millo are not clearly described in the Bible. Some scholars believe that it may have been a terraced structure or a landfill that supported the fortifications and buildings in the City of David, the oldest part of Jerusalem. Others suggest that it could have been a separate fortress or citadel within the city. Archaeological excavations in Jerusalem have uncovered remains of ancient fortifications and structures that may be associated with Millo, but the precise identification remains uncertain.
