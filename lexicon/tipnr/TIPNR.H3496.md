Jathniel is briefly mentioned in [[1Chr.26.2|1 Chronicles 26:2]] as one of the gatekeepers from the Levites during the reign of King David. The gatekeepers were responsible for guarding the entrances to the tabernacle and later the temple. They ensured that only authorized individuals entered the sacred spaces and maintained order and security. Jathniel is listed as the fourth son of Meshelemiah, who was one of the chief gatekeepers. The text does not provide any further details about Jathniel's life or his specific duties as a gatekeeper. His mention in the list of gatekeepers suggests that he was a trusted and reliable individual who served faithfully in this important role.
