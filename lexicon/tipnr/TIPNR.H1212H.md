- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.30|Ezr.10.30]]; 
- only referred to as Bezalel **<big>[[H1212|בְּצַלְאֵל]]</big>**.

Bezalel was an Israelite mentioned among the descendants of Pahath-moab who had married foreign wives during the time of Ezra \(Ezr. 10:30\). After the return from Babylonian exile, Ezra discovered that many Israelites, including priests and Levites, had intermarried with the neighboring peoples, contrary to God's commands. This posed a threat to the spiritual purity and distinct identity of the Jewish community. Ezra called for a assembly, where the people confessed their sin and agreed to separate from their foreign wives. Bezalel was one of the individuals who had taken this step, demonstrating repentance and a commitment to follow God's laws. This event highlights the importance of maintaining religious and cultural purity among the returned exiles as they sought to rebuild their lives in the Promised Land.
