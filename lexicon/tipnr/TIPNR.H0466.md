Eliphelehu is mentioned as one of the Levite musicians who participated in the procession when King David brought the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem \([[1Chr.15.18|1Ch.15.18]],21\). He was appointed, along with other skilled musicians, to play the harp during the celebration. The Levites were responsible for the musical aspects of worship in ancient Israel, and Eliphelehu's inclusion in this important event highlights his musical abilities and his role in the Levitical service. The Bible does not provide any additional information about Eliphelehu's life or other responsibilities as a Levite.
