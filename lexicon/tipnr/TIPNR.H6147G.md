Man living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Er</span>, Judah's firstborn son, was killed by God because of his wickedness.
- A man from the tribe of Judah living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Gen.38.3|Gen.38.3]]; 
- only referred to as Er **<big>[[H6147|עֵר]]</big>**; 
-  son of Judah **<big>[[H3063|יְהוּדָה]]</big>** and Bath-shua **<big>[[H1323|בַּת]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Onan **<big>[[H0209|אוֹנָן]]</big>** and Shelah **<big>[[H7956|שֵׁלָה]]</big>**; 
-  half-brother of: Perez **<big>[[H6557|פֶּרֶץ]]</big>** and Zerah **<big>[[H2226|זֶרַח]]</big>**; 
- husband of Tamar **<big>[[H8559|תָּמָר]]</big>**.

Er was the firstborn son of Judah and his Canaanite wife, the daughter of Shua \(Gen. 38:3; 1 Ch. 2:3\). He married Tamar, but the Lord put him to death because of his wickedness \(Gen. 38:6-7\). The nature of his wickedness is not specified in the text. 

After Er's death, Judah instructed his second son, Onan, to marry Tamar and produce offspring for his deceased brother, a practice known as levirate marriage \(Gen. 38:8\). However, Onan also displeased the Lord and was put to death \(Gen. 38:9-10\). 

Er is mentioned again in the genealogy of Judah \(Gen. 46:12; Num. 26:19; 1 Ch. 2:3\), which highlights the significance of his lineage despite his early death. His inclusion in these genealogies emphasizes the importance of Judah's descendants, particularly in light of the Messianic promise that would ultimately be fulfilled through this tribe \(Gen. 49:10\).
