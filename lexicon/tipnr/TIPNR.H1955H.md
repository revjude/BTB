- only referred to as Hoshaiah **<big>[[H1955|הוֹשַׁעְיָה]]</big>**;

Hoshaiah, the son of Maaseiah, was a military leader who is mentioned in the book of Jeremiah during the events following the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians. 

In [[Jer.42.1|Jeremiah 42:1]], Hoshaiah is listed among the military leaders who approached the prophet Jeremiah, along with Jezaniah, the son of Hoshaiah \(likely a different person\), and all the people, from the least to the greatest. They sought Jeremiah's counsel, asking him to pray to God for guidance on whether they should remain in Judah or go to Egypt. 

Jeremiah prayed to God and received a message instructing the people to stay in Judah, assuring them of God's protection and blessing if they obeyed \(Jeremiah 42:7-22\). However, in [[Jer.43.2|Jeremiah 43:2]], Hoshaiah is mentioned again, this time as one of the arrogant men who accused Jeremiah of speaking falsely and urged the people to disobey his message and go to Egypt. 

Despite Jeremiah's warnings, the military leaders, including Hoshaiah, and the people did not listen to him. They went to Egypt, taking Jeremiah and his scribe Baruch with them \(Jeremiah 43:4-7\). This disobedience led to the fulfillment of Jeremiah's prophecies of judgment against those who sought refuge in Egypt \(Jeremiah 44\). 

The story of Hoshaiah highlights the tension between seeking God's guidance and following one's own desires, as well as the consequences of disobeying God's word spoken through His prophets. It also demonstrates the challenges faced by Jeremiah in his prophetic ministry, as he encountered opposition and disobedience from the people.
