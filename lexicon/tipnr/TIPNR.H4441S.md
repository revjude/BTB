Malchiah was the son of Pashur, a priest during the time of the prophet Jeremiah. He was one of the officials who heard Jeremiah's message in the temple court and reported it to the other officials. Later, Malchiah was among those who plotted against Jeremiah and had him thrown into a cistern, leaving him to die. However, Ebed-Melech, an Ethiopian eunuch, rescued Jeremiah from the cistern \([[Jer.38.1|Jeremiah 38:1]], 6; 21:1\).
