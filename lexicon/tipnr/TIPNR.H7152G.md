Kerioth-hezron, also referred to as Hazor in the same verse, was a town located in the Negev, the southern region of Judah \([[Josh.15.25|Joshua 15:25]]\). It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the context of the list of towns allotted to the tribe of Judah. The name Kerioth-hezron may suggest that the town was associated with the Kenizzites, a group descended from Hezron, the grandson of Judah. Its location is unknown.
