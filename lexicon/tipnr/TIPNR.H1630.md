Mount Gerizim is a mountain located in Samaria, near the ancient city of Shechem. It is mentioned in the Bible as a place of significant events and religious importance. 

In Deuteronomy 11:29 and 27:12, Moses instructed the Israelites that when they crossed the Jordan River and entered the Promised Land, they were to pronounce blessings from Mount Gerizim and curses from Mount Ebal. This event took place under Joshua's leadership, as recorded in [[Josh.8.33|Joshua 8:33]], where half of the tribes stood in front of Mount Gerizim and the other half in front of Mount Ebal, as the blessings and curses were read aloud. 

Mount Gerizim is also associated with the parable of Jotham, son of Gideon, as recorded in [[Judg.9.7|Judges 9:7]]. After his brother Abimelech killed their seventy brothers and was made king by the men of Shechem, Jotham stood on top of Mount Gerizim and told a parable about the trees anointing a king over themselves. The parable was a warning against Abimelech's treachery and the folly of the men of Shechem in supporting him. 

In later history, Mount Gerizim became a sacred site for the Samaritans, who built a temple there in the 5th century BC. They believed that Mount Gerizim, rather than Jerusalem, was the chosen place for worship. This led to tensions between the Samaritans and the Jews, as evident in the conversation between Jesus and the Samaritan woman at the well \(John 4:20-21\). 

Today, Mount Gerizim, along with Mount Ebal, continues to be an important religious and archaeological site, with ruins of the Samaritan temple and other ancient structures still visible.
