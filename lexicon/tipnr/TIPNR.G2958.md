Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Quirinius</span> was the governor of Syria when a census was taken, as mentioned in Luke's Gospel.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Luke.2.2|Luk.2.2]]; 
- only referred to as Quirinius<[[G2958]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Κυρήνιος</span>\).

Quirinius was the governor of Syria at the time of a census that took place around the birth of Jesus \([[Luke.2.2|Luke 2:2]]\). This census, ordered by Caesar Augustus, required everyone to return to their ancestral towns to be registered. As a result, Joseph and Mary traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. The mention of Quirinius helps to provide a historical context for the birth of Christ. However, the exact date of this census and Quirinius' governorship have been the subject of much scholarly debate, as there are some apparent discrepancies between the biblical account and other historical records.
