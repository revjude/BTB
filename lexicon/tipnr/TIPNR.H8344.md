Sheshai was one of the Anakite giants who inhabited the land of Canaan before the Israelite conquest. In [[Num.13.22|Numbers 13:22]], he is mentioned along with his brothers Ahiman and Talmai as descendants of Anak, living in Hebron. The Anakites were known for their great stature and strength, which greatly intimidated the Israelite spies who were sent to scout out the land. 

In [[Josh.15.14|Joshua 15:14]] and [[Judg.1.10|Judges 1:10]], Sheshai is again mentioned as one of the three Anakite giants defeated by Caleb during the conquest of Hebron. Caleb, one of the faithful spies who had encouraged the Israelites to trust in God's power, was given Hebron as his inheritance. He successfully drove out Sheshai and his brothers, claiming the land for the tribe of Judah. The defeat of Sheshai and the other Anakites was a significant victory for the Israelites and a testament to Caleb's faith and courage.
