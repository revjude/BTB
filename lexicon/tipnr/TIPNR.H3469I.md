Ishi is mentioned as one of the leaders of the tribe of Simeon who led an expedition to secure more pastureland during the reign of King Hezekiah \([[1Chr.4.42|1Ch.4.42]]\). Along with Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, Ishi is described as a son of Ishi \(likely referring to an ancestor or clan name\). These Simeonite leaders attacked the Hamites who lived in Gedor, conquering their land and settling there because it had good pasture for their flocks. This event demonstrates the Simeonites' efforts to expand their territory and secure resources during Hezekiah's reign.
