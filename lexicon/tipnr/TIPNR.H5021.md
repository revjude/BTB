Nebushazban, also known as Nebushazban the Rabsaris, was a Babylonian official mentioned in [[Jer.39.13|Jeremiah 39:13]]. He was one of the high-ranking officers in the army of King Nebuchadnezzar II during the siege and conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BC. 

After the Babylonian army had breached the walls of Jerusalem and captured the city, Nebushazban was among the officials who entered the city. Along with Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, and other Babylonian officers, Nebushazban was involved in the decision-making process regarding the fate of the city and its inhabitants. 

According to [[Jer.39.13|Jeremiah 39:13]], Nebushazban, along with the other officials, sent for the prophet Jeremiah and had him released from the court of the guard where he had been confined. This action was in accordance with the instructions given by King Nebuchadnezzar, who had ordered that Jeremiah be protected and treated well \(Jeremiah 39:11-12\). 

Apart from this brief mention, no further information is provided about Nebushazban's background, specific role, or personal characteristics. His presence in the biblical narrative serves to highlight the involvement of high-ranking Babylonian officials in the events surrounding the fall of Jerusalem and the treatment of Jeremiah during this turbulent time.
