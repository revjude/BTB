Shammai, mentioned in [[1Chr.2.44|1 Chronicles 2:44]]-45, was an ancestor of Caleb, a significant figure in the tribe of Judah. He was the father of Maon, who is described as the father of Beth-zur. The text provides a brief genealogical record, tracing the lineage of Caleb back to Shammai. Caleb is known for his faithfulness and loyalty to God during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness. He, along with Joshua, was one of the twelve spies sent to explore the land of Canaan. While the other spies brought back a discouraging report, Caleb and Joshua remained confident in God's promise and encouraged the people to trust in Him. As a result, Caleb was rewarded with a portion of the Promised Land. The mention of Shammai in Caleb's genealogy serves to establish his family background and highlight the significance of his descendants in the history of Israel.
