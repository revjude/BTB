Jotham was a king of Judah who reigned for sixteen years, from approximately 750 to 735 BC \([[2Kgs.15.32|2 Kings 15:32]]-33; [[2Chr.27.1|2 Chronicles 27:1]]\). He was the son of Uzziah \(also known as Azariah\) and succeeded him as king \([[2Kgs.15.7|2 Kings 15:7]]; [[2Chr.26.23|2 Chronicles 26:23]]\). 

Jotham became co-regent with his father Uzziah when Uzziah was struck with leprosy for burning incense in the temple \([[2Kgs.15.5|2 Kings 15:5]]; [[2Chr.26.21|2 Chronicles 26:21]]\). After Uzziah's death, Jotham assumed full control of the kingdom \([[2Kgs.15.7|2 Kings 15:7]]; [[2Chr.26.23|2 Chronicles 26:23]]\). 

During his reign, Jotham is described as doing what was right in the eyes of the Lord, following the example of his father Uzziah \(2 Kings 15:34; 2 Chronicles 27:2\). He rebuilt the Upper Gate of the temple and carried out construction projects on the wall at Ophel \(2 Chronicles 27:3\). 

Jotham also successfully waged war against the Ammonites, subjecting them to tribute \(2 Chronicles 27:5\). He became powerful because he walked steadfastly before the Lord his God \([[2Chr.27.6|2 Chronicles 27:6]]\). 

The prophets Isaiah, Hosea, and Micah prophesied during Jotham's reign \([[Isa.1.1|Isaiah 1:1]]; [[Hos.1.1|Hosea 1:1]]; [[Mic.1.1|Micah 1:1]]\). Jotham died and was buried with his fathers in the City of David, and his son Ahaz succeeded him as king \([[2Kgs.15.38|2 Kings 15:38]]; [[2Chr.27.7|2 Chronicles 27:7]], 9\).
