Abilene was a region located north of Damascus, Syria, mentioned in [[Luke.3.1|Luke 3:1]] as being under the rule of Lysanias the tetrarch when John the Baptist began his ministry. The name Abilene is derived from its capital city, Abila. Inscriptions found near Abila refer to a Lysanias as tetrarch and mention the "Abilenians," confirming the existence of this region. The exact boundaries of Abilene are unclear, but it was situated in the Anti-Lebanon mountain range, likely in the area of the modern village of Suk Wady Barada. Abilene is only mentioned in passing in the Bible as a geographical reference point for the beginning of John's ministry.
