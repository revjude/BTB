Abinadab was the second son of Jesse, a Bethlehemite, and an older brother of King David \([[1Sam.16.8|1 Samuel 16:8]]; [[1Chr.2.13|1 Chronicles 2:13]]\). When the prophet Samuel came to Jesse's house to anoint one of his sons as the next king of Israel, Abinadab was presented to him. However, the Lord had not chosen Abinadab, and Samuel continued to inquire until David, the youngest son, was brought before him and anointed \(1 Samuel 16:6-13\). 

Abinadab, along with his brothers Eliab and Shammah, served in Saul's army during the war against the Philistines \([[1Sam.17.13|1 Samuel 17:13]]\). They were present when David, their youngest brother, arrived at the battlefront and challenged the Philistine champion Goliath \(1 Samuel 17:17-28\).
