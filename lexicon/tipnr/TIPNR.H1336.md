<small>*Mountain or mountains mentioned in Song of Solomon.*</small>

Bether is a mountain or mountains mentioned in the Song of Solomon, possibly symbolizing separation between lovers. \(Song of Solomon 2:17\)
- A location only mentioned at [[Josh.19.27|Sng.2.17]]; 
- only referred to as Bether\_Mountain **<big>[[H1336|בֶּתֶר]]</big>**.

Bether, or the "mountains of Bether," is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the Song of Solomon 2:17. The verse reads, "Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag upon the mountains of Bether." 

The exact location of the mountains of Bether is unknown, and there is no other mention of this place in the Bible or other historical sources. Some scholars suggest that "Bether" may not refer to a specific geographical location but rather serve as a symbolic or poetic term. 

The word "Bether" comes from a Hebrew root meaning "to divide" or "to cut," which has led some interpreters to understand the phrase "mountains of Bether" as referring to "mountains of separation" or "cleft mountains." This interpretation would fit the context of the Song of Solomon, which explores themes of love, longing, and separation between the lovers. 

In this view, the mountains of Bether represent the obstacles or distances that separate the lovers, and the beloved is invited to come swiftly, like a gazelle or young stag, to overcome these barriers. The imagery of the gazelle and stag also suggests the agility, grace, and strength needed to traverse the rugged terrain of the mountains. 

Other interpretations propose that the mountains of Bether may refer to a specific location, possibly in the region of Lebanon or Anti-Lebanon, known for its rugged terrain and natural beauty. However, without further biblical or historical evidence, the precise location remains uncertain.
