- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.18|Ezr.10.18]]; 
- only referred to as Jarib **<big>[[H3402|יָרִיב]]</big>**.

Jarib is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.18|Ezra 10:18]] as one of the priests who had married foreign women during the time of Ezra. After the return from the Babylonian exile, Ezra discovered that many Israelites, including priests and Levites, had intermarried with the pagan peoples of the land. This was a violation of God's command to maintain their holiness and avoid the idolatrous practices of the surrounding nations. Ezra called for a solemn assembly, during which the people confessed their sin and agreed to separate from their foreign wives. Jarib is listed among the priests who had married foreign women and pledged to put them away. The text does not provide any further details about Jarib's life or the specific circumstances of his marriage. However, his inclusion in this list serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining purity and obedience to God's commands, even for those in positions of spiritual leadership.
