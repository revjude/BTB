- A location first mentioned at [[Isa.15.5|Isa.15.5]]; 
- only referred to as Eglath-shelishiyah<[[H5697B]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ֶ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ג</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ת</span>\).

Eglath-shelishiyah was a city in Moab, mentioned in prophecies by Isaiah and Jeremiah concerning God's judgment on Moab. [[Isa.15.5|Isaiah 15:5]] states that "a cry of destruction comes from Horonaim, even to Eglath-shelishiyah." [[Jer.48.34|Jeremiah 48:34]] echoes this, saying "from Zoar even to Horonaim and to Eglath-shelishiyah, their voice is heard." 

The name Eglath-shelishiyah likely means "the third Eglath," implying there were three towns by this name. It was probably located in southern Moab, but its exact location is unknown. These prophecies indicate it would be one of the Moabite cities destroyed by invading armies as judgment for their hostility toward Israel.
