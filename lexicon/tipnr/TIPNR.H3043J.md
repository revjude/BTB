The gatekeepers were responsible for guarding the entrances to the tabernacle and later the temple, ensuring that only authorized individuals entered the sacred spaces and maintaining order and security. Jediael is listed as the second son of Meshelemiah, suggesting that he held a position of responsibility within the gatekeeping duties. The text does not provide any further details about Jediael's specific role or the duration of his service. However, his mention in the context of the gatekeepers highlights the importance of this function in the maintenance and protection of the holy places during David's reign.
