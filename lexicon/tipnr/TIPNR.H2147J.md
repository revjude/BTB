- A man from the tribe of Benjamin living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.8.27|1Ch.8.27]]; 
- only referred to as Zichri **<big>[[H2147|זִכְרִי]]</big>**; 
-  son of Jeroham **<big>[[H3395|יְרֹחָם]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Shamsherai **<big>[[H8125|שַׁמְשְׁרַי]]</big>**, Shehariah **<big>[[H7841|שְׁחַרְיָה]]</big>**, Athaliah **<big>[[H6271|עֲתַלְיָה]]</big>**, Jaareshiah **<big>[[H3298|יַעֲרֶשְׁיָה]]</big>** and Elijah **<big>[[H0452|אֵלִיָּה]]</big>**.

Zichri was a third Benjamite mentioned in the genealogy of Shaharaim's descendants in 1 Chronicles 8. Like his brother \(or possibly cousin\) mentioned in verse 23, he was also a son of Jeroham. The repetition of the name Zichri within the same family may suggest that it was a common or significant name among the Benjamites. The genealogical record in 1 Chronicles 8 provides a detailed account of the families and descendants of the tribe of Benjamin, highlighting their importance within the nation of Israel. However, no further information is given about this particular Zichri or his role within the Benjamite community.
