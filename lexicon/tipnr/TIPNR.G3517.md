<small>*Male • A Christian in Rome greeted by Paul.*</small>

Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Nereus</span> was a Christian in Rome to whom Paul sent greetings in his letter to the Romans.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Rom.16.15|Rom.16.15]]; 
- only referred to as Nereus **<big>[[G3517|Νηρεύς]]</big>**.

Nereus is mentioned briefly in [[Rom.16.15|Romans 16:15]] as one of the individuals to whom the Apostle Paul sends greetings in his letter to the church in Rome. Paul's greeting to Nereus is part of a larger list of personal greetings to various members of the Roman Christian community. 

The fact that Nereus is mentioned by name suggests that he was a prominent or well-known member of the church in Rome. It is possible that Paul had met Nereus personally or had heard of his faith and dedication to Christ through others. 

In the context of Romans 16, Paul is concluding his letter by extending personal greetings and commendations to various individuals and groups within the Roman church. These greetings serve to strengthen the bonds of fellowship and unity among the believers and to acknowledge the important roles played by different members of the community. 

Apart from this single mention in [[Rom.16.15|Romans 16:15]], no further information is provided about Nereus in the New Testament. Some early Christian traditions and apocryphal writings associate Nereus with the martyrdom of Domitilla, a Roman noblewoman, but these accounts are not considered historically reliable. 

The inclusion of Nereus in Paul's greetings highlights the diversity and interconnectedness of the early Christian community in Rome. It also demonstrates Paul's personal concern for and appreciation of the individuals who made up the church, even though he had not yet visited Rome in person at the time of writing the epistle.
