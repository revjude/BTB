Man living at the time of United Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Ithiel</span> is mentioned twice in Proverbs 30:1, but the meaning and context of the name are uncertain.
- A man living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at Pro.30.1; 
- referred to as Ithiel or God \(KJV= Ithiel\) <[[H0384H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ית</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יא</span>ֵ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>\).

Ithiel is mentioned twice in Proverbs 30:1, which introduces the sayings of Agur son of Jakeh. The verse reads, "The sayings of Agur son of Jakeh—an inspired utterance. This man's utterance to Ithiel: 'I am weary, God, but I can prevail.'" 

The exact meaning and context of Ithiel in this passage are unclear. Some scholars suggest that Ithiel might be a student or disciple of Agur, to whom he is imparting his wisdom. Others propose that Ithiel could be another name for God, as the name means "God is with me." 

Given the uncertainty surrounding the identity of Ithiel and the cryptic nature of the passage, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about this individual. The mention of Ithiel in this context highlights the challenges of interpreting some of the more enigmatic passages in the Bible and the importance of studying them carefully in light of the overall biblical message.
