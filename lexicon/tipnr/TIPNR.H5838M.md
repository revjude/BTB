Azariah, the son of Oded, is mentioned in [[2Chr.15.1|2 Chronicles 15:1]] as a prophet who delivered a message from God to King Asa of Judah. Azariah went out to meet Asa and encouraged him to seek the Lord and remain faithful to Him. He reminded Asa that God had been with him when he sought Him and that the Lord would continue to bless him if he remained committed to following God's ways. Azariah's message came at a time when Asa had achieved military success and peace for Judah. The prophet's words inspired Asa to initiate religious reforms, removing idolatrous practices and renewing the nation's covenant with God. Azariah's prophetic ministry played a significant role in guiding King Asa and the people of Judah to renewed faith and obedience to the Lord.
