Elishah is mentioned in the genealogy of the nations descended from Noah \([[Gen.10.4|Gen.10.4]]; [[1Chr.1.7|1Ch.1.7]]\). He was a son of Javan, who was a son of Japheth, one of Noah's three sons. Elishah and his brothers, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim \(or Rodanim\), are associated with the coastal regions and islands of the Mediterranean Sea \(Gen.10.5\). The descendants of Javan are believed to have settled in various parts of Greece and the Aegean Sea. The name Elishah may be associated with Alashiya, an ancient name for Cyprus, or with the region of Elis in Greece. However, the exact location and extent of the territory associated with Elishah are not specified in the Bible.
