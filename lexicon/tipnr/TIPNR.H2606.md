The Tower of Hananel was a prominent tower located in the wall of Jerusalem, mentioned in the context of the city's rebuilding and restoration. In Nehemiah 3:1 and 12:39, it is recorded that the tower was rebuilt by the high priest Eliashib and his fellow priests during the reconstruction of Jerusalem's walls in the time of Nehemiah. The tower was likely situated on the northern side of the city, near the Sheep Gate and the Fish Gate. The prophets Jeremiah and Zechariah also mention the Tower of Hananel in their visions of Jerusalem's future restoration and expansion \(Jer. 31:38; Zech. 14:10\). In these prophetic passages, the tower serves as a boundary marker, indicating the extent of the city's rebuilding and the scope of God's blessing upon Jerusalem. The Tower of Hananel thus stands as a symbol of Jerusalem's strength, security, and future hope in the prophetic literature.
