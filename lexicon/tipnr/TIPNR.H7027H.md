Levite living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Kish</span> was a Levite from the clan of Merari, whose descendants were assigned duties in the tabernacle service.
- A man from the tribe of Levi living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[1Chr.23.21|1Ch.23.21]]; 
- only referred to as Kish<[[H7027H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ק</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יש</span>ׁ\); 
-  son of Mahli<[[H4249G]]>; 
- a brother of Libni<[[H3845H]]> and Eleazar<[[H0499J]]>; 
-  father of Jerahmeel<[[H3396H]]>.

Kish is mentioned in [[1Chr.23.21|1 Chronicles 23:21]]-22 and 24:29 as a Levite from the clan of Merari. He is listed among the descendants of Mahli, one of the sons of Merari. 

In the context of organizing the Levitical duties during the reign of King David, the descendants of Kish were assigned specific roles in the service of the tabernacle \([[1Chr.23.21|1 Chronicles 23:21]]-22\). This highlights the importance of the Levitical clans and their responsibilities in maintaining the worship and religious practices of ancient Israel. 

The genealogy of the Levites in 1 Chronicles 24 again mentions Kish as a descendant of Mahli \(1 Chronicles 24:29\). This reaffirms his lineage and place within the Levitical clan structure. 

Apart from these genealogical records and the mention of his descendants' duties, no further information is provided about Kish's life or specific role within the Levitical community. His inclusion in the genealogies emphasizes the continuity and organization of the Levitical clans in their service to God.
