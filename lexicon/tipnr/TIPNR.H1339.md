Bathsheba was the wife of Uriah the Hittite, one of David's mighty men. David committed adultery with her, resulting in her pregnancy \([[2Sam.11.3|2 Samuel 11:3]]\). After Uriah's death in battle, arranged by David, Bathsheba became David's wife and gave birth to Solomon \([[2Sam.12.24|2 Samuel 12:24]]\). Later, when David was old, Bathsheba and the prophet Nathan worked together to ensure Solomon's ascension to the throne \([[1Kgs.1.11|1 Kings 1:11]]-31\). As queen mother, Bathsheba held a position of influence in the royal court \([[1Kgs.2.13|1 Kings 2:13]]-19\). She is also mentioned in the superscription of Psalm 51, which is associated with David's repentance after his sin with Bathsheba. In [[1Chr.3.5|1 Chronicles 3:5]], Bathsheba is referred to as "Bath-shua," and her four sons with David are listed. Bathsheba's story illustrates the consequences of sin, God's mercy and forgiveness, and the importance of divine sovereignty in the fulfillment of God's plans.
