Pacatiana is a place mentioned in some manuscripts of [[1Tim.6.21|1 Timothy 6:21]], where Paul extends greetings to those in this location. However, the majority of manuscripts do not include this reference, and it is considered by most scholars to be a later addition to the text. As a result, very little is known about Pacatiana, and its exact location and significance remain uncertain. It is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in other contemporary historical sources.
