Scythians were a nomadic people group mentioned by Paul in [[Col.3.11|Colossians 3:11]]. In this passage, Paul emphasizes that in Christ, there is no distinction between Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and freeman. The Scythians were known for their barbaric reputation and were considered uncivilized by the Greeks and Romans. They lived in the area north of the Black Sea and were skilled horsemen and archers. By mentioning the Scythians, Paul highlights that the gospel message transcends cultural and ethnic barriers, and that all people are equal in Christ.
