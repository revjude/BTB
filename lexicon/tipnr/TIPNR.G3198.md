Priest living at the time of the Patriarchs

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Melchizedek</span>, king of Salem and priest of God Most High, who blessed Abraham \([[Gen.14.18|Gen.14.18]]\).
- A priest living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.14.18|Gen.14.18]]; 
- referred to as Melchizedek **<big>[[H4442|מַלְכִּי־צֶדֶק]]</big>**, or Melchizedek \(KJV= Melchisedec\)  **<big>[[G3198|Μελχισεδέκ]]</big>**.

Melchizedek was the king of Salem and a priest of God Most High \([[Gen.14.18|Gen.14.18]]\). He blessed Abraham and received a tithe from him after Abraham's victory over Chedorlaomer and his allies. Melchizedek brought out bread and wine, demonstrating his priestly role. The Psalms refer to the Messiah as a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek \(Psa.110.4\), indicating that Melchizedek's priesthood was seen as a type or foreshadowing of Christ's eternal priesthood. The book of Hebrews expands on this concept, presenting Jesus as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek \([[Heb.5.6|Heb.5.6]],10; 6.20; 7.1,10,11,15,17,21\). Melchizedek's unique priesthood, which combined royalty and priestly service to God Most High, is seen as a precedent for Jesus' eternal priesthood and kingship.
