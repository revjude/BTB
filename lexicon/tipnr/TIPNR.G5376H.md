Philip was the son of Herod the Great and his fifth wife, Mariamne II. He was the half-brother of Herod Antipas, who ruled as tetrarch of Galilee and Perea during the time of Jesus' ministry. Philip was married to Herodias, but Herod Antipas took her as his own wife, divorcing his first wife, the daughter of Aretas IV, king of the Nabataeans. John the Baptist condemned this marriage as unlawful, leading to his imprisonment and eventual execution \([[Matt.14.3|Matthew 14:3]]-12; [[Mark.6.17|Mark 6:17]]-29; [[Luke.3.19|Luke 3:19]]-20\). The Gospels do not provide further details about Philip's life or his response to the events involving Herodias and Herod Antipas.
