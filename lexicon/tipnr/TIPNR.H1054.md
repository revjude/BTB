Beth-tappuah, meaning "house of apples" or "place of apples" in Hebrew, is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Josh.15.53|Joshua 15:53]]. It is listed among the towns in the hill country of Judah, along with other towns such as Maon, Carmel, and Ziph. 

The exact location of Beth-tappuah is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the southern part of the hill country of Judah, south of Hebron. The hill country of Judah was known for its rugged terrain, with steep hills and narrow valleys, making it a natural defensive region. 

The name "Beth-tappuah" suggests that the area was known for its apple orchards or that apples were an important product of the town. In ancient times, the term "apple" could have referred to various fruits, such as apricots, quinces, or even citrons. 

No other information about Beth-tappuah is provided in the Bible, and the town is not mentioned in any other historical or archaeological context. Its inclusion in the list of Judah's towns highlights the extent of the tribe's territory and the variety of settlements within it.
