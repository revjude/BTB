The Rephaim, also referred to as Zamzummin by the Ammonites \(Deuteronomy 2:20\), were a race of giants who inhabited parts of Canaan before the Israelite conquest. They are first mentioned in [[Gen.14.5|Genesis 14:5]], where they were defeated by Chedorlaomer and his allies in Ashteroth-karnaim. The Rephaim were one of the groups that inhabited the land promised to Abraham's descendants \([[Gen.15.20|Genesis 15:20]]\). They were known for their great stature and strength, and their land was characterized by large, fortified cities \(Deuteronomy 3:11, 13\). The Rephaim were gradually dispossessed of their land by the Israelites during the conquest of Canaan. The Ammonites drove them out of the territory east of the Jordan River \(Deuteronomy 2:20-21\), while the Israelites, under Joshua's leadership, defeated Og, the king of Bashan, who was described as the last of the Rephaim \([[Josh.12.4|Joshua 12:4]]; 13:12\). Despite their formidable reputation, the Israelites were able to overcome the Rephaim with God's help and claim their inheritance in the Promised Land \([[Josh.17.15|Joshua 17:15]]\).
