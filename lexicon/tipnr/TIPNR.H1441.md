Gideoni, the son of Abidan, is mentioned in the book of Numbers as the leader of the tribe of Benjamin during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness. He is first introduced in [[Num.1.11|Numbers 1:11]] during the census of the Israelite men of military age, where he is listed as the representative of Benjamin. In [[Num.2.22|Numbers 2:22]], Gideoni is described as the leader of the Benjamite camp, which was positioned on the west side of the tabernacle, along with the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh. During the offering of the dedicatory gifts for the altar, Gideoni presented the offering for the tribe of Benjamin on the ninth day \([[Num.7.60|Numbers 7:60]], 65\). In [[Num.10.24|Numbers 10:24]], Gideoni is mentioned again as the leader of the Benjamite division during the Israelites' march through the wilderness. His presence as a tribal leader throughout the book of Numbers highlights the importance of organization and leadership during the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land.
