Mahalalel is mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as one of the descendants of Perez who lived in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile \([[Neh.11.4|Neh.11.4]]\). He is listed among the people who resettled in Jerusalem as part of Nehemiah's efforts to repopulate the city \(Neh.11.1-36\). Mahalalel belonged to the tribe of Judah, specifically the clan of Perez, which was one of the prominent families in Judah. The resettlement of Jerusalem was a significant step in the restoration of the Jewish community and the reestablishment of their presence in the holy city after the exile. No further details are provided about Mahalalel's personal life or his specific contributions to the community in the post-exilic period. His inclusion in the list of residents highlights the importance of family lineage and tribal identity in the social and religious life of the Jewish people.
