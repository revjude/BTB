Sirah, also known as the Cistern of Sirah, is mentioned in the account of the murder of Abner by Joab \(2 Sam. 3:26\). Abner, who had been the commander of Saul's army, had recently defected to David's side after a dispute with Ish-bosheth, Saul's son. Joab, David's military commander, held a grudge against Abner for killing his brother Asahel in battle \(2 Sam. 2:18-23\). 

When Abner left David's presence at Hebron, Joab sent messengers after him and brought him back from the Cistern of Sirah. Upon Abner's return, Joab took him aside and stabbed him to death in revenge for his brother's killing \(2 Sam. 3:27\). 

The exact location of Sirah is not specified in the biblical text, but it was apparently a well-known landmark near Hebron. The name "Sirah" may be derived from the Hebrew word "sur," meaning "to turn aside" or "to depart," possibly indicating a place where travelers would stop or turn off the main road. 

David, who had not authorized Abner's murder, mourned his death and publicly cursed Joab and his family for their treachery \(2 Sam. 3:28-39\). This incident highlights the complex political situation during the early years of David's reign and the challenges he faced in uniting the kingdom under his rule.
