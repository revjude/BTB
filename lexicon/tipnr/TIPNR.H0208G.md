Onam was a descendant of Seir the Horite, a group that inhabited the land of Edom before Esau's descendants \([[Gen.36.23|Genesis 36:23]]; [[1Chr.1.40|1 Chronicles 1:40]]\). He is mentioned in the genealogies of the Horites, which are recorded in the context of Esau's family history. The Horites were a people group that lived in the region of Seir, which later became known as Edom. Onam's mention in these genealogies suggests that he was a significant figure among the Horites.
