Nahash is mentioned in [[2Sam.17.25|2 Samuel 17:25]] as the father of Abigail and Zeruiah, who are identified as the sisters of King David. This brief reference appears in the context of describing the lineage of Amasa, the commander of Absalom's army during his rebellion against David. 

The passage states that Amasa was the son of Jether \(or Ithra\) the Ishmaelite and Abigail, the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah. This information suggests that Nahash was the grandfather of Amasa and the father-in-law of Jesse, David's father. 

Apart from this genealogical note, no further details are provided about Nahash's life, character, or relationship with his daughters or King David. The mention of Nahash in this context serves primarily to establish the family connection between Amasa and David, highlighting the complex web of relationships within the royal family. 

The fact that Abigail and Zeruiah are referred to as David's sisters indicates that Nahash may have been married to one of Jesse's wives, or that Nahash and Jesse had children through a levirate marriage \(a custom in which a man would marry his deceased brother's widow to continue the family line\).
