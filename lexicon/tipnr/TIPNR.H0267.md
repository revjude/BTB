The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 4 traces the descendants of Judah, focusing on various clans and families within the tribe. It provides a detailed record of the lineage of significant individuals and their offspring. 

Apart from being listed as a descendant of Reaiah, no further information is given about Ahumai's life, his role within the family, or any notable events associated with him.
