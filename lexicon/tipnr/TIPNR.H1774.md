Dizahab is mentioned in Deuteronomy 1:1 as one of the places near where Moses delivered his final speeches to the Israelites before their entry into the Promised Land. It is listed along with other locations, such as Suph, Paran, Tophel, and Laban, to provide a geographical context for Moses' discourses. The exact location of Dizahab is unknown, but it was likely situated in the wilderness region east of the Jordan River, where the Israelites had been wandering for forty years. The name "Dizahab" means "enough gold" or "abundance of gold" in Hebrew, possibly indicating the presence of gold in the area.
