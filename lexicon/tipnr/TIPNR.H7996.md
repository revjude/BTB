Shallecheth, meaning "casting down," was one of the gates of Jerusalem mentioned in the assignment of guard duties to the Levites during the reign of King David \(1 Chr. 26:16\). The gate was assigned to Shuppim and Hosah, along with the storehouse. The exact location of the Shallecheth Gate is uncertain, but it was likely situated on the western side of the city, possibly near the Temple Mount. Some scholars suggest that the name "Shallecheth" may refer to a refuse gate where ashes and other debris from the temple were discarded. Others propose that it could have been a gate used for the disposal of sacrificial remains. However, these interpretations remain speculative due to the limited information provided in the biblical text. The assignment of Levites to guard the Shallecheth Gate highlights the importance of maintaining the security and sanctity of the temple area and the city of Jerusalem.
