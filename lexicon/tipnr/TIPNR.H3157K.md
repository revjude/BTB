- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at Hos.1.4; 
- only referred to as Jezreel **<big>[[H3157|יִזְרְעֵאל]]</big>**; 
-  son of Hosea **<big>[[H1954|הוֹשֵׁעַ]]</big>** and Gomer **<big>[[H1586|גֹּמֶר]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Lo-ruhamah **<big>[[H3819|לֹא רֻחָמָה]]</big>** , Lo-ammi H3818\).

In Hosea 1:4, God instructs the prophet Hosea to name his son Jezreel as a symbolic act representing divine judgment. The name Jezreel is associated with the valley of Jezreel, where Jehu, a former king of Israel, had carried out a massacre \(2Ki.9-10\). God declares that he will punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed at Jezreel and bring an end to the kingdom of Israel. The child's name serves as a prophetic sign of the coming judgment and the end of Jehu's dynasty.
