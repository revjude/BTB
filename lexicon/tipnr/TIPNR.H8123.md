Samson was an Israelite judge during the period when the Philistines oppressed Israel. His birth was announced by an angel to his parents, Manoah and his wife, who had been barren \(Judges 13:2-5\). The angel instructed them to raise Samson as a Nazirite, dedicated to God from birth \(Judges 13:5, 7\). As Samson grew, the Lord blessed him, and the Spirit of the Lord began to stir him \([[Judg.13.24|Judges 13:24]]-25\). Samson's life was characterized by his immense strength, which he used to fight against the Philistines. He killed a lion with his bare hands \([[Judg.14.5|Judges 14:5]]-6\), struck down thirty men of Ashkelon \([[Judg.14.1|Judges 14:1]]9\), and killed a thousand Philistines with a donkey's jawbone \([[Judg.15.1|Judges 15:1]]4-16\). However, Samson's weakness was his attraction to foreign women. He fell in love with a Philistine woman named Delilah, who eventually betrayed him by discovering the secret of his strength \(Judges 16:4-20\). The Philistines captured Samson, blinded him, and forced him to grind grain in prison \([[Judg.16.2|Judges 16:2]]1\). During a Philistine festival, Samson was brought out to entertain them. He prayed to God for strength one last time and pushed against the pillars of the temple, causing it to collapse and kill himself along with many Philistines \([[Judg.16.2|Judges 16:2]]2-30\). Despite his flaws, Samson is remembered as a man of faith who delivered Israel from Philistine oppression \([[Heb.11.32|Hebrews 11:32]]\).
