Lod, also known as Lydda, was a city located in the territory of Benjamin \([[1Chr.8.12|1 Chronicles 8:12]]; [[Ezra.2.33|Ezra 2:33]]; [[Neh.7.37|Nehemiah 7:37]]\). It was one of the cities resettled by the Israelites after the Babylonian exile \([[Ezra.2.33|Ezra 2:33]]; [[Neh.7.37|Nehemiah 7:37]]; 11:35\). In the New Testament, Lydda is mentioned as the place where the apostle Peter healed a paralyzed man named Aeneas \(Acts 9:32-35\). The healing of Aeneas led to many people in Lydda and the nearby plain of Sharon turning to the Lord \(Acts 9:35\). Lydda was also the location from which Peter was summoned to Joppa when Tabitha \(Dorcas\) died \(Acts 9:38\).
