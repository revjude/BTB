- A prince of Persia living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Esth.1.14|Est.1.14]]; 
- only referred to as Shethar<[[H8369]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ש</span>ֵׁ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ת</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>\).

Shethar was one of the seven Persian nobles who served in the court of King Ahasuerus \(Xerxes I\) during the events described in the Book of Esther. In [[Esth.1.14|Esther 1:14]], he is mentioned along with the other nobles—Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan—as being closest to the king and holding the highest positions in the kingdom. These nobles had access to the king's presence and were consulted for their expertise in law and justice. When King Ahasuerus sought advice regarding Queen Vashti's refusal to appear before him, Shethar and the other nobles were called upon to provide counsel. Their advice led to the king's decree that Vashti be removed from her position and replaced, setting in motion the events that would lead to Esther becoming queen. Shethar's presence among the king's closest advisors indicates his high status and influence within the Persian court.
