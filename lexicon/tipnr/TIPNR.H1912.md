India is mentioned twice in the book of Esther as the eastern boundary of the Persian Empire during the reign of King Ahasuerus \(Xerxes I\). In [[Esth.1.1|Esther 1:1]], the vast extent of Ahasuerus' kingdom is described, stretching from India to Ethiopia \(Cush\). Later, in [[Esth.8.9|Esther 8:9]], when the king issues a decree to protect the Jews, it is sent to all the provinces from India to Ethiopia. These references suggest that the Persian Empire had control over or influence in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. However, the Bible does not provide any specific details about the region or its people.
