- A man living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at 1Ki.11.20; 
- only referred to as Genubath **<big>[[H1592|גְּנֻבַת]]</big>**; 
- a son of Hadad **<big>[[H1908|הֲדַד]]</big>** and sister\_of\_Tahpenes **<big>[[H8472|תַּחְפְּנֵיס]]</big>**.

Genubath is mentioned in 1 Kings 11:20 as the son of Hadad, an Edomite prince who fled to Egypt during King David's reign. Hadad found favor with Pharaoh, who gave him a house, land, and food, and also arranged for him to marry the sister of Queen Tahpenes \(1 Kings 11:19\). Genubath was born to Hadad and his Egyptian wife, and he was raised in Pharaoh's palace alongside the Pharaoh's own children \(1 Kings 11:20\). This indicates that Hadad and his family were well-respected and had a high status in the Egyptian court. The mention of Genubath's upbringing in the palace suggests that he may have had a significant role or influence later in life, although no further details are provided about his life or accomplishments.
