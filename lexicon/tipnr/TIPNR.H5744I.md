- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.11.47|1Ch.11.47]];

Obed was an Ishmaelite warrior who fought in David's army \([[1Chr.11.47|1 Chronicles 11:47]]\). He is mentioned among the list of mighty men who supported David, which includes warriors from various backgrounds and regions. As an Ishmaelite, Obed likely descended from Ishmael, Abraham's son. His presence in David's army demonstrates the diversity of support David received during his reign.
