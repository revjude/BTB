Shihor-libnath is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the description of the territory allotted to the tribe of Asher \(Josh. 19:26\). It is listed as one of the boundary points, along with other towns and landmarks such as Helkath, Mount Carmel, and Dor. The exact location of Shihor-libnath is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the coastal region of northern Israel, near the Mediterranean Sea. The name "Shihor-libnath" may be derived from the Hebrew words "shihor" \(black\) and "libnath" \(white\), possibly referring to the contrast between the dark river and the white limestone cliffs in the area. Some scholars suggest that Shihor-libnath may be associated with the Crocodile River \(modern-day Nahal Taninim\) or the nearby town of Achzib. However, these identifications remain speculative due to the limited information provided in the biblical text.
