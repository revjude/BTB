People from Mecherath\(?\)

The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Mecherathites</span> were a clan or inhabitants of an unknown place called Mecherah \([[1Chr.11.36|1Ch.11.36]]\).
- People from Mecherath\(?\), only mentioned at [[1Chr.11.36|1Ch.11.36]]; 
- only referred to as Mecherathites **<big>[[H4382|מְכֵרָתִי]]</big>**.

The Mecherathites are mentioned in the list of David's mighty men, specifically in reference to Hepher the Mecherathite \([[1Chr.11.36|1 Chronicles 11:36]]\). The term "Mecherathite" likely refers to an individual from a place called Mecherah, but the exact location of this place is unknown. It is possible that Mecherah was a small town or village in Israel, and that Hepher was a skilled warrior from that community who joined David's army. However, due to the lack of additional information in the Bible, the identity and location of the Mecherathites remain uncertain.
