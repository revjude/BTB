Mikloth is mentioned in the genealogies of the tribe of Benjamin in the book of 1 Chronicles \([[1Chr.8.32|1Ch.8.32]]; 9.37,38\). He was the son of Eshek and lived in Jerusalem. The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 8 traces the descendants of Benjamin, providing a detailed record of the families and individuals who belonged to this tribe. Mikloth is listed among the sons of Eshek, along with his brother Shimeah \([[1Chr.8.32|1Ch.8.32]]\). In the parallel genealogy in 1 Chronicles 9, Mikloth is again mentioned as the son of Shimeah \([[1Chr.9.37|1Ch.9.37]],38\). This suggests that Shimeah and Eshek may have been different names for the same person or that there was a discrepancy in the genealogical records. No further details about Mikloth's life, occupation, or role within the Benjamite community are provided in the biblical text. His mention serves to document the lineage of Benjamin and the individuals who were part of this tribe.
