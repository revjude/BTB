Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Barabbas</span>, a notorious prisoner, was released by Pilate instead of Jesus at the crowd's demand.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Matt.27.16|Mat.27.16]]; 
- referred to as Barabbas **<big>[[G0912|Βαραββᾶς]]</big>**, or \[ \] \(NIV= Jesus\)  **<big>[[G2424|Ἰησοῦς]]</big>**.

Barabbas was a notorious prisoner mentioned in all four Gospels \([[Matt.27.16|Matthew 27:16]]-26; [[Mark.15.7|Mark 15:7]]-15; [[Luke.23.18|Luke 23:18]]-25; John 18:40\). He was in custody during the trial of Jesus before Pontius Pilate. According to the Gospel accounts, it was customary during the Passover feast for the Roman governor to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. Pilate offered the people a choice between releasing Jesus or Barabbas. The chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude to ask for Barabbas and demand Jesus' crucifixion. Pilate, although convinced of Jesus' innocence, yielded to the crowd's pressure and released Barabbas while condemning Jesus to death. Some manuscripts of [[Matt.27.16|Matthew 27:16]]-17 refer to Barabbas as "Jesus Barabbas," suggesting that he may have also been called Jesus. Barabbas is described as a notorious criminal, with Mark and Luke mentioning that he had committed murder during an insurrection. His release in place of Jesus highlights the irony and injustice of the situation.
