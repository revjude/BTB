- People from Amor\(?\), first mentioned at [[Gen.10.16|Gen.10.16]]; 
- only referred to as Amorites<[[H0567]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>ֱ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>מ</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>\); 
- descended from Canaan<[[H3667G]]> along with Sidon<[[H6721G]]>, Heth<[[H2845]]>, Jebusites<[[H2983G]]>, Girgashites<[[H1622]]>, Hivites<[[H2340]]>, Arkites<[[H6208]]>, Sinites<[[H5513]]>, Arvadites<[[H0721]]>, Zemarites<[[H6786]]> and Hamathites<[[H2577]]>.

The Amorites were one of the Canaanite peoples who inhabited the land promised to the Israelites. They are first mentioned in the Table of Nations as descendants of Canaan, the son of Ham. The Amorites lived in the hill country and were known for their military prowess. 

During the time of Abraham, the Amorites were one of the groups living in Canaan. God promised Abraham that his descendants would inherit the land when the iniquity of the Amorites reached its full measure. 

When the Israelites left Egypt and approached the Promised Land, the Amorites were among the peoples they were told to dispossess. The Amorite kings Sihon and Og, who ruled over the territories east of the Jordan River, were defeated by the Israelites under Moses' leadership. 

After the conquest of Canaan under Joshua, the Amorites were among the groups that the Israelites failed to completely drive out. They remained a significant presence in the land, often oppressing the Israelites during the time of the judges. 

The Amorites are mentioned throughout the historical books of the Old Testament as one of the primary enemies of Israel. Their presence in the land was a result of the Israelites' disobedience to God's command to completely remove them. 

The prophets Ezekiel and Amos also refer to the Amorites, using them as an example of the wickedness that Israel had adopted. The complete destruction of the Amorites was a sign of God's judgment against their sinful practices.
