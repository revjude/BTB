Eliezer was one of the leaders summoned by Ezra to the river Ahava during the return of the exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem \([[Ezra.8.16|Ezr.8.16]]\). Ezra had gathered the people at the river and discovered that there were no Levites among them. He then sent for Eliezer and other leaders to bring Levites and temple servants to accompany them on their journey. The Bible does not provide any additional information about Eliezer's role or status among the returning exiles.
