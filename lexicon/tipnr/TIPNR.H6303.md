- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.44|Ezr.2.44]]; 
- only referred to as Padon **<big>[[H6303|פָּדוֹן]]</big>**.

Padon is mentioned in the lists of the people who returned to Jerusalem from the Babylonian exile \([[Ezra.2.44|Ezra 2:44]]; [[Neh.7.47|Nehemiah 7:47]]\). He was an ancestor of a group of temple servants, also known as the Nethinim, who were assigned to assist the Levites in the maintenance and service of the temple. The Nethinim were considered a distinct group among the returnees and were listed separately from the other Israelites. The mention of Padon in these lists suggests that he was a significant figure among the temple servants, possibly a leader or a prominent ancestor. However, no further details about Padon's life or specific role are provided in the Bible.
