Midian was a son of Abraham and his second wife, Keturah \([[Gen.25.2|Gen.25.2]]; [[1Chr.1.32|1Ch.1.32]]\). He was born after the death of Sarah and is listed among Abraham's sons by Keturah, along with Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Ishbak, and Shuah. Midian had five sons: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah \([[Gen.25.4|Gen.25.4]]; [[1Chr.1.33|1Ch.1.33]]\). These sons became the ancestors of the Midianite tribes, who are mentioned throughout the Old Testament. The Midianites lived in the desert regions of the Arabian Peninsula and were known for their nomadic lifestyle and involvement in trade. They played a significant role in the stories of Joseph \(Gen.37.28,36\) and Moses \(Ex.2.15-3.1\). Later, the Midianites oppressed Israel during the time of the judges, until Gideon defeated them \(Jdg.6-8\). The descendants of Midian, the Midianites, were a prominent people group in the ancient Near East, and their interactions with the Israelites shaped various events in biblical history.
