Zedad is a place name that appears twice in the Bible, both times in the context of describing the boundaries of the Promised Land. In [[Num.34.8|Numbers 34:8]], as part of the instructions given to Moses regarding the division of the land, Zedad is mentioned as a point on the northern border, following the entrance of Hamath. The border was to extend from Mount Hor to the entrance of Hamath and then to Zedad. In Ezekiel's vision of the restored land of Israel \(Ezek. 47:15\), Zedad is again mentioned as part of the northern border, along with the entrance of Hamath and Berothah. The exact location of Zedad is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the region of Hamath, north of Damascus in modern-day Syria. Its mention in both the Mosaic and Ezekiel's descriptions of the land's boundaries highlights its significance as a geographical marker and its role in defining the extent of the Promised Land. The inclusion of Zedad in these passages emphasizes the importance of the land's boundaries and the precision with which they were defined in the biblical record.
