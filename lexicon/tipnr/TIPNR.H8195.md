He was the son of Shobal and lived in the land of Seir, which was later inhabited by the Edomites. The Horites were the original inhabitants of Seir before the descendants of Esau \(the Edomites\) displaced them. Shepho is listed among the chiefs of the Horites, indicating his position of authority within their tribal structure. These genealogical records provide insight into the early inhabitants of the region and their leadership.
