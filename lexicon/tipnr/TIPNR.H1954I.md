Hoshea is mentioned in [[Neh.10.23|Nehemiah 10:23]] as one of the leaders of the people who signed the covenant to follow the Law of God during the time of Nehemiah. This covenant was a solemn agreement made by the Israelites to obey God's commandments, separate themselves from the surrounding nations, and support the temple service. 

The signing of the covenant was a significant event in the history of Israel, as it marked a renewed commitment to God and His laws after the Babylonian exile. The leaders who signed the covenant, including Hoshea, represented the various families and groups within the Jewish community. 

By signing the covenant, Hoshea and the other leaders publicly declared their dedication to God and their willingness to lead the people in obedience to His commandments. This act of commitment was essential for the spiritual and social renewal of the Jewish community as they sought to reestablish themselves in the land of Israel.
