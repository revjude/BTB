Ahimaaz is briefly mentioned in the Bible as the father of Ahinoam, who became the wife of King Saul, the first king of Israel. Ahinoam was one of Saul's two wives, the other being Rizpah, daughter of Aiah. \([[1Sam.14.50|1Sa.14.50]]\) 

The mention of Ahimaaz in this context suggests that he may have been a prominent figure or had some connection to the royal family. However, no further information about Ahimaaz's life, occupation, or role is provided in the biblical text. His significance lies primarily in his relationship to Ahinoam and, by extension, to King Saul.
