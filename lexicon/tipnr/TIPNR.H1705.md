Daberath was a city located in the territory allocated to the tribe of Issachar \([[Josh.19.12|Joshua 19:12]]\) during the division of the Promised Land. It is mentioned as one of the border cities of Issachar, along with Chisloth-tabor and Japhia. 

In [[Josh.21.28|Joshua 21:28]] and [[1Chr.6.72|1 Chronicles 6:72]], Daberath is listed as one of the cities given to the Levites of the Gershonite clan from the tribe of Issachar, along with its pasturelands. This indicates that Daberath, or a portion of it, was set apart for the Levites, who were responsible for assisting the priests in the tabernacle service and teaching the law to the people. 

The exact location of Daberath is not specified in the Bible, but it is generally identified with the modern village of Daburiyya, located at the base of Mount Tabor in Lower Galilee. This identification is supported by the similarity in name and the geographical context provided by the biblical references. 

Apart from its designation as a Levitical city and its location on the border of Issachar's territory, no other details are provided about Daberath in the Bible. Its inclusion in the lists of cities and boundaries suggests that it was a recognized settlement during the time of Joshua and the early Israelite period, but its specific history and significance remain unknown.
