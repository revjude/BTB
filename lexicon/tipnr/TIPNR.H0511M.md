Elkanah is mentioned as one of the gatekeepers assigned to guard the ark of the covenant during its transfer from the house of Obed-edom to Jerusalem \([[1Chr.15.23|1Ch.15.23]]\). King David had decided to bring the ark, the sacred symbol of God's presence, to Jerusalem. As part of the procession, Levites were appointed to carry the ark and serve in various roles. Elkanah, along with Berechiah, was entrusted with the responsibility of being a gatekeeper for the ark. The gatekeepers' duty was to ensure the safety and reverence of the ark during its journey. Elkanah's appointment as a gatekeeper highlights the importance of the Levitical roles in the proper handling and transportation of the sacred objects. The Bible does not provide any further details about Elkanah's life or his role beyond this specific event.
