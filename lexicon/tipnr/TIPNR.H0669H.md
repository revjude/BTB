The Ephraim Gate was one of the gates in the wall of Jerusalem during the time of the Divided Kingdom. It is mentioned in the context of the conflict between King Jehoash of Israel and King Amaziah of Judah \([[2Kgs.14.13|2 Kings 14:13]]; [[2Chr.25.23|2 Chronicles 25:23]]\). 

After Amaziah's defeat by Jehoash, the king of Israel came to Jerusalem and broke down a section of the city wall from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate, a distance of about 400 cubits \(approximately 600 feet or 180 meters\). This action was likely meant to humiliate Judah and demonstrate Israel's military superiority. 

The Ephraim Gate was probably located on the north side of the city, facing toward the territory of Ephraim. Its exact location is uncertain, but it may have been situated near the modern-day Damascus Gate or Herod's Gate. The destruction of this portion of the wall would have left Jerusalem vulnerable and symbolized the weakened state of Judah under Amaziah's rule.
