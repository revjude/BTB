Hamonah is a city mentioned in the prophetic vision of Ezekiel, specifically in [[Ezek.39.16|Ezekiel 39:16]]. The name "Hamonah" is derived from the Hebrew word "hamon," meaning "multitude" or "horde." 

In the context of Ezekiel's prophecy, Hamonah is associated with the aftermath of the battle against Gog and his armies. The preceding verses describe how God will strike down Gog and his hordes on the mountains of Israel, leaving their bodies to be consumed by birds and beasts \(Ezekiel 39:1-4\). 

The slain army of Gog will be so numerous that it will take seven months for the people of Israel to bury them and cleanse the land \(Ezekiel 39:12-14\). The place where Gog's multitude is buried will be called the Valley of Hamon-gog, meaning "the multitude of Gog" \(Ezekiel 39:11\). 

After this burial, the city nearby will be renamed Hamonah \([[Ezek.39.16|Ezekiel 39:16]]\). The renaming of the city to "Multitude" or "Horde" serves as a lasting reminder of the immense number of Gog's soldiers who were defeated and buried there. 

The exact location of Hamonah is not specified in the text, and there is no historical record of a city by this name. As Ezekiel's prophecy is highly symbolic and apocalyptic, the city of Hamonah may not refer to a literal, physical city but rather serves as a metaphor for the complete destruction and burial of God's enemies. 

The prophecy of Hamonah and the defeat of Gog underscores God's ultimate victory over the forces of evil and His protection of His people, Israel. It also emphasizes the importance of cleansing the land from the defilement caused by sin and God's enemies.
