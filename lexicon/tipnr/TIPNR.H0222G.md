Uriel, also referred to as Zephaniah, is mentioned in the genealogies of the Levites in [[1Chr.6.24|1 Chronicles 6:24]] and 6:36. He was a descendant of Kohath, one of the three main divisions of the Levites. Uriel is listed as the son of Tahath and the father of Uzziah \(called Azariah in verse 36\). He is identified as an ancestor of the prophet Samuel, who was also a descendant of Kohath. The dual names Uriel and Zephaniah may indicate that he was known by both names or that there was some variation in the historical records. The genealogies in 1 Chronicles trace the lineage of important figures in Israel's history, highlighting the continuity of the Levitical priesthood and the family lines of significant individuals like Samuel.
