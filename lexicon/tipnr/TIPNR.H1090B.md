Bilhah was a town located in the southern part of Judah, within the territory allotted to the tribe of Simeon \([[1Chr.4.29|1 Chronicles 4:29]]\). In the parallel list found in Joshua 19:1-9, the town is called Balah, suggesting that the two names refer to the same place. No other details are provided about Bilhah's history, size, or significance. It should not be confused with Bilhah, the handmaid of Rachel and mother of Dan and Naphtali \(Genesis 30:1-8\).
