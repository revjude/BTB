<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Joseph</span>, also called Barsabbas or Justus, was considered as a replacement for Judas among the apostles.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Num.13.7|Act.1.23]]; 
- referred to as Joseph<[[G2501M]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ἰωσήφ</span>\), or Barsabbas \(KJV= Barsabas\) <[[G0923G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Βαρσαβᾶς</span>\), or Justus<[[G2459I]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ἰοῦστος</span>\).

Joseph, also known as Barsabbas or Justus, was one of the candidates proposed to replace Judas Iscariot as an apostle after Judas' betrayal and death \(Acts 1:23\). He was one of the men who had accompanied the apostles during Jesus' entire ministry, from the time of John's baptism until Jesus' ascension \(Acts 1:21-22\). The apostles prayed for God's guidance and cast lots between Joseph and Matthias. The lot fell to Matthias, and he was added to the eleven apostles \(Acts 1:24-26\). The double names "Barsabbas" and "Justus" suggest that Joseph was known by multiple names. "Barsabbas" likely means "son of the Sabbath," while "Justus" is a Roman surname meaning "righteous" or "just."
