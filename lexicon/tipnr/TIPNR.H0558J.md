- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Chr.25.27|Amo.7.10]]; 
- only referred to as Amaziah **<big>[[H0558|אֲמַצְיָה]]</big>**.

Amaziah was a priest who served at the sanctuary in Bethel during the reign of Jeroboam II, king of Israel. When the prophet Amos came to Bethel and prophesied against the kingdom of Israel, Amaziah opposed him. He sent a message to King Jeroboam, accusing Amos of conspiracy and claiming that the land could not bear his words. Amaziah also told Amos to flee to the land of Judah, eat bread there, and prophesy there, but not to prophesy anymore at Bethel, as it was the king's sanctuary and a temple of the kingdom. Amos responded by affirming that he was not a professional prophet, but a herdsman and a dresser of sycamore figs, and that the Lord had called him to prophesy to Israel.
