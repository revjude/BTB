Adonijah is mentioned in [[2Chr.17.8|2 Chronicles 17:8]] as one of the Levites commissioned by King Jehoshaphat to teach the Book of the Law throughout the cities of Judah. Jehoshaphat, known for his devotion to God, sought to strengthen the spiritual foundation of his kingdom by sending out teachers to instruct the people in the ways of the Lord. 

Adonijah, along with other Levites, priests, and officials, was entrusted with the task of traveling to the cities of Judah and educating the people about the Law of God. This educational mission was part of Jehoshaphat's reforms to bring the nation back to the proper worship and obedience to the Lord. 

The inclusion of Adonijah in this group of teachers highlights the importance of the Levites' role in preserving and transmitting the knowledge of God's Law to the people. As a Levite, Adonijah would have been well-versed in the scriptures and equipped to teach others. 

Apart from this brief mention, no other details are provided about Adonijah's background, family, or personal life. His participation in this teaching mission, however, underscores the significance of religious education and the collaborative effort between the king and the Levites to promote spiritual renewal in Judah.
