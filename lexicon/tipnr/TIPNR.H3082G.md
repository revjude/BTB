Jonadab, the son of Rechab, is mentioned in the books of Jeremiah and 2 Kings as the founder of the Rechabites, a nomadic tribe known for their strict adherence to a set of rules that he established. Jonadab instructed his descendants to abstain from drinking wine, building houses, sowing seed, and planting vineyards \([[Jer.35.6|Jer.35.6]]-7\). Instead, they were to live in tents and follow a nomadic way of life. 

The Rechabites' faithfulness to Jonadab's commands is highlighted in Jeremiah 35, where the prophet uses their example to contrast the disobedience of the people of Judah. When offered wine by Jeremiah, the Rechabites refused, stating that they were following the instructions of their ancestor Jonadab \([[Jer.35.6|Jer.35.6]],8\). God commends the Rechabites for their steadfast obedience and promises that they will always have a descendant to serve Him \([[Jer.35.18|Jer.35.18]]-19\). 

In 2 Kings 10:15-23, Jonadab is mentioned in connection with Jehu, the king of Israel. After Jehu had carried out a purge of the worshippers of Baal, he met Jonadab and invited him to witness his zeal for the Lord. Jonadab's presence and approval of Jehu's actions suggest that he was a respected figure known for his devotion to God. 

The example of Jonadab and the Rechabites serves as a reminder of the importance of obedience, faithfulness, and the value of maintaining a distinct identity in the midst of a changing society. Their commitment to their way of life and their ancestor's instructions stands in stark contrast to the disobedience and unfaithfulness of the people of Judah during the time of Jeremiah.
