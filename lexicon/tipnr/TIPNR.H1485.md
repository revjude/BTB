Gurbaal is a place mentioned in the context of King Uzziah's military campaigns. During his reign, Uzziah waged war against the Philistines and broke down the walls of several of their cities. He also fought against the Arabians who lived in Gurbaal and against the Meunites \([[2Chr.26.7|2 Chronicles 26:7]]\). The exact location of Gurbaal is not specified in the Bible, but it is described as a place inhabited by Arabians, suggesting that it was likely located in the region southeast of Judah, possibly in the Negev or the Sinai Peninsula. Uzziah's success against the Arabians in Gurbaal demonstrates his military prowess and the extent of his kingdom's influence during his reign. Apart from this brief mention in the account of Uzziah's military exploits, no further details about Gurbaal are provided in the Bible.
