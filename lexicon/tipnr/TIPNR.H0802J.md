[[2Sam.5.13|2 Samuel 5:13]] mentions that King David took more wives in Jerusalem after he had conquered the city and made it his capital. These wives, whose names are not recorded in the Bible, bore David additional sons and daughters. The practice of kings having multiple wives was common in ancient Near Eastern societies, often serving to establish political alliances and ensure the continuation of the royal lineage. However, the Bible also records instances where having many wives led to spiritual and moral challenges, as in the case of Solomon. The unnamed wives of David in Jerusalem played a role in expanding his family and solidifying his dynasty, even though their individual stories are not detailed in the biblical narrative.
