- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[2Kgs.15.25|2Ki.15.25]]; 
- only referred to as Arieh **<big>[[H0745|אַרְיֵה]]</big>**.

Arieh is briefly mentioned in [[2Kgs.15.25|2 Kings 15:25]] as one of the officers of King Pekahiah of Israel. Pekahiah was the son and successor of Menahem, ruling over the northern kingdom of Israel in the 8th century BC. During Pekahiah's reign, one of his officers, Pekah son of Remaliah, conspired against him. Pekah, along with fifty men from Gilead, attacked and killed Pekahiah in the citadel of the royal palace in Samaria. The text mentions that Arieh and Argob were with Pekahiah at the time of the assassination. 

The brief mention of Arieh in this context suggests that he was a high-ranking officer or official in Pekahiah's court. However, no further details about his role, responsibilities, or fate after the assassination are provided in the biblical text. The assassination of Pekahiah and the usurpation of the throne by Pekah occurred during a period of political instability and turmoil in the northern kingdom of Israel, which ultimately led to its downfall and exile at the hands of the Assyrian Empire.
