Sallai is mentioned in [[Neh.11.8|Nehemiah 11:8]] as one of the Benjamites who settled in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. The list in Nehemiah 11 records the names of the people who volunteered to live in Jerusalem, which was in need of repopulation and rebuilding after the return from exile \(Nehemiah 11:1-2\). Sallai is listed along with Gabbai as a Benjamite who resided in Jerusalem. No further details are provided about his specific role or contributions to the community. The resettlement of Jerusalem by people from various tribes, including Benjamin, was an important step in the restoration of Jewish life and worship in the city following the exile.
