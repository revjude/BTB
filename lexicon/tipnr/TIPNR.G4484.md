Rhegium, also known as Rhegion or modern-day Reggio Calabria, was a city in southern Italy, located on the "toe" of the Italian Peninsula, near Sicily. It is mentioned in the Bible as a stop on Paul's journey to Rome as a prisoner. After departing from Syracuse in Sicily, Paul's ship arrived at Rhegium, where they waited for a day before continuing on to Puteoli with a favorable south wind \(Act. 28:13\). Rhegium was a significant port city in ancient times, situated on the Strait of Messina, which separates Italy from Sicily.
