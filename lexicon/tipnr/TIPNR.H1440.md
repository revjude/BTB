Gidom was a place mentioned in the context of the Benjamite War, a conflict that arose after the horrific incident involving the concubine of a Levite at Gibeah. During the battle between the Israelite tribes and the Benjamites, the Benjamites were initially successful in repelling the attacks. However, the Israelites set an ambush and lured the Benjamites away from Gibeah. As the Benjamites were retreating, they were pursued by the Israelites on the road to Gidom \([[Judg.20.45|Judges 20:45]]\). The Israelites overtook the Benjamites and defeated them, striking down many of them. The reference to Gidom suggests that it was a known location near Gibeah, possibly on the route of the Benjamites' retreat. Apart from this single mention, no further details about Gidom are provided in the Bible, and its exact location is unknown.
