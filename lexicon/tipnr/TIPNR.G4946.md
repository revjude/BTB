Syracuse was an important city on the eastern coast of the island of Sicily. It is mentioned in Acts 28:12 as a place where the ship carrying Paul to Rome stopped for three days. The stop at Syracuse occurred after the ship had sailed from Malta, where Paul and the other passengers had been shipwrecked \(Acts 28:1-11\). Syracuse was founded by Greek colonists in the 8th century BC and became a significant center of Greek culture and commerce in the Mediterranean world. During the Roman period, Syracuse served as the capital of the province of Sicily. The brief mention of Syracuse in Acts provides insight into the route taken by Paul and his companions on their journey to Rome.
