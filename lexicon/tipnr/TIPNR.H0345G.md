Aiah is mentioned in the genealogy of Esau, the son of Isaac and the brother of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\). He is listed as the son of Zibeon the Hivite and the brother of Anah. \([[Gen.36.24|Gen.36.24]]; [[1Chr.1.40|1Ch.1.40]]\) 

The genealogy in Genesis 36 records the descendants of Esau, who settled in the region of Seir and became the Edomites. It provides a detailed account of the chiefs and clans that emerged from Esau's lineage. 

Zibeon, Aiah's father, is described as a Hivite, indicating that he belonged to one of the Canaanite tribes that inhabited the land before the Israelites. Zibeon's sons, Aiah and Anah, are mentioned together, suggesting that they were both significant figures within their clan. 

Anah, Aiah's brother, is notable for discovering hot springs in the wilderness while pasturing donkeys for his father, Zibeon. \([[Gen.36.24|Gen.36.24]]\) This discovery may have been significant for the nomadic lifestyle of the Edomites in the arid region of Seir. 

Apart from being listed in the genealogy, no further details are provided about Aiah's life or his role within the Edomite clan. His mention serves to document the lineage of Esau and to showcase the various tribes and chiefs that emerged from his descendants.
