Bukkiah was a Levite musician who served in the temple during the reign of King David \(1 Chr. 25:4, 13\). He was one of the fourteen sons of Heman, the king's seer, who were appointed as musicians in the house of the Lord. Bukkiah and his brothers were skilled in singing and playing musical instruments, and they were responsible for providing music for worship services in the temple. The musicians were divided into twenty-four groups, each serving for a specified period. Bukkiah was the head of the sixth group \(1 Chr. 25:13\). The inclusion of Bukkiah and his family in the lists of temple musicians highlights the importance of music in Israelite worship and the role of the Levites in maintaining the temple's spiritual atmosphere.
