Mount Hor was a mountain located on the border of Edom \([[Num.20.23|Numbers 20:23]]\). During Israel's journey from Egypt to Canaan, God commanded Moses to take Aaron and his son Eleazar to the top of Mount Hor. There, Moses removed Aaron's priestly garments and put them on Eleazar, transferring the high priesthood to him. Aaron died on the mountain and was mourned by the Israelites for 30 days \([[Num.20.25|Numbers 20:25]]-29\). The people then traveled from Mount Hor to the Red Sea to bypass Edom \([[Num.21.4|Numbers 21:4]]\). Mount Hor marked the end of Aaron's leadership as high priest and his death in the 40th year after the Exodus \([[Num.33.38|Numbers 33:38]]-39\).
