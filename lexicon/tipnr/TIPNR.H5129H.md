- A prophetess living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.6.14|Neh.6.14]]; 
- only referred to as Noadiah **<big>[[H5129|נוֹעַדְיָה]]</big>**.

Noadiah was a false prophetess who lived during the time of Nehemiah, when the walls of Jerusalem were being rebuilt \([[Neh.6.14|Nehemiah 6:14]]\). She, along with other false prophets, tried to intimidate and discourage Nehemiah from his work. These prophets had been hired by Tobiah and Sanballat, enemies of Nehemiah, to hinder the rebuilding efforts. Nehemiah, however, recognized their deceit and prayed for strength to continue his work despite their opposition.
