Tiphsah is mentioned in [[2Kgs.15.16|2 Kings 15:16]] as a city that was attacked by Menahem, king of Israel, during his reign. This Tiphsah is likely a different city from the one mentioned in 1 Kings 4:24, as it seems to be located within the territory of Israel rather than on the Euphrates River. The biblical text records that Menahem attacked Tiphsah and its surrounding territory, brutally conquering the city and ripping open the pregnant women. This act of cruelty was likely intended to terrorize the population and suppress any potential rebellion against Menahem's rule. The exact location of this Tiphsah is uncertain, but it may have been situated in the northern part of Israel, possibly near the border with Syria.
