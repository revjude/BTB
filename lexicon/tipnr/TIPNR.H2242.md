- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Esth.1.10|Est.1.10]]; 
- only referred to as Zethar<[[H2242]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ז</span>ֵ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ת</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>\).

Zethar was one of the seven eunuchs who served in the court of King Ahasuerus \(Xerxes I\) of Persia, as recorded in the Book of Esther. He is mentioned by name along with the other eunuchs: Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, and Carcas. In the story, King Ahasuerus commanded these seven eunuchs to bring Queen Vashti before him during a royal feast, so that he could display her beauty to the guests. This incident led to Vashti's refusal and subsequent removal as queen, setting the stage for Esther to become the new queen. As a eunuch, Zethar would have been a trusted servant in the royal court, with responsibilities related to the king's personal affairs and harem.
