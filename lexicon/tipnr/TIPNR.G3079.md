Claudius <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Lysias</span>, the Roman commander in Jerusalem, rescued Paul from a Jewish mob and sent him to Felix \([[Luke.3.1|Act.23.26]]-24.22\).
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Luke.3.1|Act.23.26]]; 
- referred to as Lysias **<big>[[G3079|Λυσίας]]</big>**, or Claudius **<big>[[G2804|Κλαύδιος]]</big>**.

Claudius Lysias was a Roman tribune \(commander\) stationed in Jerusalem during the time of Paul's arrest \([[Luke.3.1|Act.23.26]]\). When Paul was attacked by a Jewish mob in the temple, Lysias intervened with his soldiers and took Paul into custody \(Act.21.30-33\). Upon learning of a plot to kill Paul, Lysias arranged for him to be transferred to Caesarea under armed guard to appear before Felix, the governor \(Act.23.12-35\). In his letter to Felix, Lysias explained the circumstances of Paul's arrest and his decision to send him to the governor for judgment \([[Luke.3.1|Act.23.26]]-30\). Lysias admitted that he had initially arrested Paul thinking he was a rebel, but later learned that the charges against him were related to Jewish religious disputes \(Act.23.28-29\). Lysias' actions demonstrate his commitment to maintaining order and ensuring that Paul received a fair trial under Roman law. His letter to Felix also serves as an official record of the events surrounding Paul's arrest and transfer to Caesarea.
