Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Lazarus</span>, a poor man in Jesus' parable of the rich man and Lazarus \(Lk.16.20-25\).
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Luke.16.20|Luk.16.20]]; 
- only referred to as Lazarus **<big>[[G2976|Λάζαρος]]</big>**.

Lazarus is the name given to the poor man in Jesus' parable of the rich man and Lazarus \(Lk.16.19-31\). In the parable, Lazarus is described as a beggar covered with sores who longed to eat the crumbs falling from the rich man's table \(Lk.16.20-21\). When both men died, Lazarus was carried by angels to Abraham's side in heaven, while the rich man found himself in Hades, in torment \(Lk.16.22-23\). The rich man called out to Abraham, asking him to send Lazarus to dip his finger in water and cool his tongue \(Lk.16.24\). However, Abraham replied that a great chasm separated them and that it was impossible for anyone to cross from one side to the other \(Lk.16.25-26\). The parable emphasizes the reversal of fortunes in the afterlife and the importance of caring for the poor and needy in this life.
