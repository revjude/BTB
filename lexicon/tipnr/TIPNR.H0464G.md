Eliphaz was the firstborn son of Esau, born to his wife Adah \([[Gen.36.4|Gen.36.4]]\). He became the father of several sons, including Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, Kenaz, and Amalek \(through his concubine Timna\) \([[Gen.36.11|Gen.36.11]]-12\). These sons grew into clans within the Edomite nation, with Eliphaz's descendants being listed among the chiefs of Edom \([[Gen.36.15|Gen.36.15]]-16\). Eliphaz's lineage is also recorded in the genealogy of Esau in [[1Chr.1.35|1 Chronicles 1:35]]-36. As the firstborn of Esau, Eliphaz played a significant role in the establishment and growth of the Edomite people, who were the descendants of Esau. The Bible does not provide any further details about Eliphaz's life or personal characteristics.
