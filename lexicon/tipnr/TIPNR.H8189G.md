Shaaraim, meaning "two gates," was a town located in the Shephelah \(lowland hills\) of Judah, mentioned in close association with Socoh and Azekah \(Josh. 15:36\). The town is also referenced in the account of David's victory over Goliath and the Philistines \(1 Sam. 17\). After the Philistines were defeated at Socoh, they retreated down the valley of Elah \(modern Wadi es-Sant\) toward Gath and Ekron, passing by Shaaraim \(1 Sam. 17:52\). Some scholars suggest that the "two gates" mentioned in this passage may refer to the Philistine strongholds of Gath and Ekron themselves, rather than a specific town. The exact location of Shaaraim is uncertain, but it has been tentatively identified with Tell Zakariya or Khirbet Sa'ireh, both located in the Shephelah region. However, these identifications remain speculative due to limited archaeological evidence.
