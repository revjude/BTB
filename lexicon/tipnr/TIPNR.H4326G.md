Mijamin is mentioned in the book of 1 Chronicles as a priest who served during the reign of King David \([[1Chr.24.9|1Ch.24.9]]\). He was the head of the sixth division of the priestly order, as organized by David. The priests were divided into twenty-four divisions, each responsible for serving in the temple for a designated period. Mijamin's division was one of these twenty-four groups. No further details about Mijamin's life, family, or specific duties as a priest are provided in the biblical text.
