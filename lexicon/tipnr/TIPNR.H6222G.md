Asaiah was a servant of King Josiah of Judah during the time when the Book of the Law was discovered in the Temple. When the book was read to Josiah, he tore his robes in distress and sent Asaiah, along with several others, to inquire of the Lord through the prophetess Huldah. Huldah confirmed that the curses written in the book would come upon Judah for their idolatry but that Josiah would not see this judgment because of his humble response. Asaiah's involvement in this event suggests he was a trusted servant of the king and played a role in Josiah's religious reforms.
