The Stone of Ezel is mentioned in [[1Sam.20.19|1 Samuel 20:19]] as the place where David and Jonathan planned to meet and communicate secretly during David's flight from King Saul. The name "Ezel" may be derived from the Hebrew word "azel," meaning "departure" or "going away," possibly referring to David's intended departure from Saul's court. 

In the context of the narrative, David had become aware of Saul's intention to harm him and sought Jonathan's help to determine the king's true intentions. Jonathan devised a plan to shoot arrows near the Stone of Ezel as a signal to David. If Jonathan told his servant that the arrows were on the near side of the stone, it would indicate that David was safe to return. However, if Jonathan said that the arrows were beyond the stone, it would mean that David should flee for his life \(1 Samuel 20:20-22\). 

The exact location of the Stone of Ezel is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in a field near Gibeah, Saul's hometown, where David and Jonathan could meet without arousing suspicion. The stone may have served as a boundary marker or a prominent landmark that could be easily identified. 

The Stone of Ezel incident demonstrates the deep friendship between David and Jonathan and their loyalty to each other, even in the face of Saul's hostility. It also showcases their trust in God and their willingness to communicate and act in wisdom to protect David's life.
