Josech, also known as Joseph, is mentioned in [[Luke.3.26|Luke 3:26]] as one of the ancestors of Jesus Christ. He is listed in the genealogy of Jesus recorded by Luke, which traces Jesus' lineage back through his mother Mary's family line. In this genealogy, Josech/Joseph is identified as the son of Joda and the father of Semein. The genealogy covers a period of several centuries, from Jesus back to Adam, but no specific information is provided about Josech/Joseph's life or the time period in which he lived. His inclusion in the genealogy helps to establish Jesus' connection to the royal line of David and the fulfillment of messianic prophecies. The variation in names \(Josech/Joseph\) may reflect different traditions or translations of the name.
