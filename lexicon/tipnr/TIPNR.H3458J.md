Ishmael son of Jehohanan is mentioned as one of the leaders in Judah during the reign of King Jehoshaphat \([[2Chr.19.11|2Ch.19.11]]\). After Jehoshaphat appointed judges throughout the land, he charged them to judge faithfully and warned them against corruption \(2Ch.19.5-10\). 

In Jerusalem, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites, priests, and heads of Israelite families to administer the law of the Lord and settle disputes \(2Ch.19.8\). Amariah the chief priest was over them in matters of the Lord, while Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the leader of the tribe of Judah, was over them in the king's matters \([[2Chr.19.11|2Ch.19.11]]\). 

This brief mention of Ishmael highlights his role as a leader in Judah under Jehoshaphat's rule. He had authority in civil and administrative matters, working alongside the religious leaders who oversaw spiritual concerns. Ishmael's position indicates he was a trusted figure in Jehoshaphat's government, helping to implement the king's reforms and maintain order in the kingdom.
