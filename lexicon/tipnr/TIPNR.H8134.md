Shinab is mentioned in [[Gen.14.2|Genesis 14:2]] as the king of Admah, one of the five cities in the Valley of Siddim \(the Salt Sea or Dead Sea region\). He, along with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela \(Zoar\), engaged in a rebellion against Chedorlaomer, the king of Elam, to whom they had been subject for twelve years. In the thirteenth year, these kings fought against Chedorlaomer and his allies in the Battle of the Valley of Siddim. The outcome of the battle is not explicitly stated for Shinab, but it is known that the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell into the tar pits, while the rest fled to the mountains.
