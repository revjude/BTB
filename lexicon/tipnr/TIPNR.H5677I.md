Eber is mentioned in [[1Chr.8.12|1 Chronicles 8:12]] as one of the sons of Elpaal, a descendant of Benjamin. He is listed along with his brothers Misham and Shemed. 

The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 8 traces the lineage of the tribe of Benjamin, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. Benjamin was the youngest son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and Rachel, and his descendants settled in the region allotted to them in the Promised Land. 

Eber and his brothers are mentioned in the context of the descendants of Shaharaim, who had sent away his wives Hushim and Baara \(1 Chronicles 8:8\). Shaharaim's descendants, including Elpaal and his sons, are listed as part of the Benjamite lineage. 

The mention of Eber in this genealogy serves to highlight the importance of family lineage and tribal identity in ancient Israelite society. It also demonstrates the detailed record-keeping of the Chronicler, who sought to preserve the genealogical history of the tribes of Israel. 

Apart from this brief mention, no further information is provided about Eber or his specific role within the tribe of Benjamin. His inclusion in the genealogy helps to establish the continuity of the Benjamite lineage and their connection to the larger history of Israel.
