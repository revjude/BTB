Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Tychicus</span> was a faithful companion of Paul who served as his messenger to the churches in Asia Minor.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Gen.4.22b|Act.20.4]]; 
- referred to as Tychicus or \[ \] \(KJV= Tychicus\) <[[G5190]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Τυχικός</span>\).

Tychicus was a faithful companion and fellow worker of the Apostle Paul, mentioned several times in the New Testament \(Acts 20:4; [[Eph.6.21|Ephesians 6:21]]; [[Col.4.7|Colossians 4:7]]; [[2Tim.4.12|2 Timothy 4:12]]; [[Titus.3.12|Titus 3:12]]\). He was from the province of Asia \(modern-day western Turkey\) and accompanied Paul on his third missionary journey. Paul entrusted Tychicus with important missions, sending him as a messenger to the churches in Ephesus \([[Eph.6.21|Ephesians 6:21]]\) and Colossae \([[Col.4.7|Colossians 4:7]]\) to deliver letters and bring news of Paul's circumstances. In these letters, Paul describes Tychicus as a beloved brother, faithful minister, and fellow servant in the Lord. Later, Paul sent Tychicus to Ephesus to relieve Timothy \([[2Tim.4.12|2 Timothy 4:12]]\) and planned to send him to Crete to assist Titus \([[Titus.3.12|Titus 3:12]]\). Tychicus' frequent appearances in Paul's letters and his role as a trusted messenger demonstrate his significance in the early church and his close relationship with the apostle.
