Zelzah is mentioned only once in the Bible as a place that the prophet Samuel used as a landmark when giving directions to Saul after anointing him as king \([[1Sam.10.2|1Sa.10.2]]\). Samuel told Saul that he would meet two men by Rachel's tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah. The exact location of Zelzah is unknown, but the reference to Rachel's tomb places it somewhere north of Jerusalem, likely between Ramah and Gibeah.
