Asahel was a Levite who served during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. As part of Hezekiah's reforms to restore proper worship, Asahel was appointed as one of the overseers in charge of distributing the tithes and dedicated things brought to the Temple. These contributions were used to support the priests and Levites serving in the Temple. Asahel's appointment suggests he was a trusted and responsible individual capable of handling these important duties.
