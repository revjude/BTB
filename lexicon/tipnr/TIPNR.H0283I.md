Ahio is mentioned in the genealogies of the tribe of Benjamin as one of the sons of Abiel \(or 'Jeiel'\), who was the father or re-founder of Gibeon. Abiel \(or 'Jeiel'\) and his wife Maakah had several children, including Ahio. \(1Ch.8.29-31; 9.35-37\) 

The genealogies in 1 Chronicles 8 and 9 provide a detailed record of the Benjamite families who lived in Gibeon, a city located north of Jerusalem. These chapters aim to establish the lineage and settlement of the Benjamites in the post-exilic period. 

Apart from being listed among Jeiel's sons, no further information is given about Ahio's life, occupation, or role within the Benjamite community in Gibeon. His mention in the genealogy serves to document the family lines and the population of Gibeon.
