Nathan was a prominent prophet in Israel during the reigns of King David and his son Solomon. He first appears in the biblical narrative when David expresses his desire to build a temple for the Lord \([[2Sam.7.2|2 Samuel 7:2]]-3; [[1Chr.17.1|1 Chronicles 17:1]]-2\). Initially, Nathan encourages David to proceed, but later receives a message from God directing David not to build the temple, a task that would fall to his son Solomon \([[2Sam.7.4|2 Samuel 7:4]]-17; [[1Chr.17.3|1 Chronicles 17:3]]-15\). 

One of Nathan's most significant roles was confronting David about his sin with Bathsheba and the subsequent murder of her husband, Uriah. Nathan told David a parable about a rich man who took a poor man's beloved lamb, prompting David to condemn the rich man's actions \([[2Sam.12.1|2 Samuel 12:1]]-6\). Nathan then boldly declared, "You are the man!" \([[2Sam.12.7|2 Samuel 12:7]]\), revealing that the parable was an allegory for David's own sin. David repented, and Nathan conveyed God's forgiveness but also pronounced the consequences of David's actions \([[2Sam.12.1|2 Samuel 12:1]]3-15\). 

Nathan played a crucial role in ensuring Solomon's accession to the throne. When David's son Adonijah attempted to seize the throne, Nathan and Bathsheba worked together to inform David and secure his decision to appoint Solomon as his successor \(1 Kings 1\). 

During Solomon's reign, Nathan's sons held important positions in the royal court. One son, Azariah, was put in charge of the district officers \(1 Kings 4:5\), while another, Zabud, was a priest and the king's friend \(1 Kings 4:5\). 

Nathan's prophetic ministry and influence extended beyond his lifetime. His writings were included in the records of the acts of David \([[1Chr.29.29|1 Chronicles 29:29]]\) and Solomon \([[2Chr.9.29|2 Chronicles 9:29]]\). The Psalms also mention Nathan, specifically in the title of Psalm 51, which is associated with David's repentance following his confrontation with Nathan. 

As a prophet, Nathan served as a messenger of God, offering guidance, correction, and support to the kings of Israel. His legacy as a fearless and faithful servant of God is remembered throughout the biblical narrative.
