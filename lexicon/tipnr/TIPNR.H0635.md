Esther, born Hadassah, was a Jewish woman who became the queen of Persia during the reign of King Ahasuerus \(Xerxes I\). She was an orphan raised by her cousin Mordecai \([[Esth.2.7|Esther 2:7]]\). Esther was chosen to be queen after Ahasuerus deposed Queen Vashti \([[Esth.2.17|Esther 2:17]]\). When Haman, a high-ranking official, plotted to exterminate the Jews, Esther risked her life by approaching the king uninvited to expose Haman's plot \(Esther 4-5\). As a result, Haman was hanged, and the Jews were given the right to defend themselves, leading to their deliverance \(Esther 7-8\). Esther and Mordecai instituted the Feast of Purim to commemorate this event \([[Esth.9.29|Esther 9:29]]-32\). Her story exemplifies courage, faith, and God's providence in protecting His people.
