Mount Nebo, also known as Abarim, was a mountain range east of the Jordan River in Moabite territory. It is most notably the place where Moses was directed by God to view the Promised Land before his death \(Deut. 32:49; 34:1\). God told Moses to go up to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, and view the land of Canaan, which He was giving to the Israelites \(Deut. 3:27; 34:1-4\). After seeing the land, Moses died on the mountain and was buried by God in an unknown location in the valley of Moab \(Deut. 34:5-6\). The Israelites, after wandering in the wilderness, camped in the mountains of Abarim before crossing the Jordan River into Canaan \(Num. 33:47-48\).
