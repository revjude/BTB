Obed was the son of Boaz and Ruth, born in Bethlehem \(Ruth 4:17\). His birth was a significant event in the story of Ruth, as it marked the restoration of Naomi's family line and the continuation of the lineage that would eventually lead to King David. Obed was the father of Jesse and the grandfather of David \(Ruth 4:21-22; 1 Chronicles 2:12; Matthew 1:5; [[Luke.3.32|Luke 3:32]]\). His name means "servant" or "worshiper," possibly reflecting his family's devotion to God. Obed's life is not detailed in the Bible, but his role in the genealogy of David and ultimately Jesus Christ highlights the importance of his place in God's plan.
