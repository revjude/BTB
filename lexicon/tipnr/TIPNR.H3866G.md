Ludim was one of the sons of Mizraim, who was a son of Ham \([[Gen.10.13|Gen.10.13]]; [[1Chr.1.11|1Ch.1.11]]\). He is mentioned in the Table of Nations, which records the descendants of Noah's sons after the flood. Ludim is listed among the descendants of Ham, specifically as a son of Mizraim, who is associated with Egypt. The Ludim are believed to be the ancestors of the Lydians, a people group that inhabited the region of Lydia in western Anatolia \(modern-day Turkey\). However, the exact relationship between the Ludim and the historical Lydians is not certain.
