- People from Lud, first mentioned at [[Gen.10.13|Gen.10.13]]; 
- only referred to as Ludim<[[H3866G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>לו</span>ּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>\);

Ludim was one of the sons of Mizraim, who was a son of Ham \([[Gen.10.13|Gen.10.13]]; [[1Chr.1.11|1Ch.1.11]]\). He is mentioned in the Table of Nations, which records the descendants of Noah's sons after the flood. Ludim is listed among the descendants of Ham, specifically as a son of Mizraim, who is associated with Egypt. The Ludim are believed to be the ancestors of the Lydians, a people group that inhabited the region of Lydia in western Anatolia \(modern-day Turkey\). However, the exact relationship between the Ludim and the historical Lydians is not certain.
