Kemuel, the son of Hebron, is mentioned in [[1Chr.27.17|1 Chronicles 27:17]] as the leader of the Levites during the reign of King David. The context of the passage is the organization of David's administration and the leaders appointed over various tribes and groups \(1 Chronicles 27:1-34\). 

As the leader of the Levites, Kemuel would have been responsible for overseeing the religious duties and responsibilities of the Levites, who were set apart for the service of the tabernacle and later the temple. 

The mention of Kemuel in this administrative list highlights the importance of the Levites in the religious life of Israel during David's reign and the need for effective leadership within their ranks. 

Apart from this brief mention in the context of David's administration, no other information is provided about Kemuel's background, specific duties, or the duration of his leadership over the Levites.
