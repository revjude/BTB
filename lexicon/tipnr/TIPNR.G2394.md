<small>*Male • Paul's host in Thessalonica; relative of Paul*</small>

Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Jason</span> was Paul's host in Thessalonica and a relative of Paul mentioned in his letter to the Romans.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Gen.46.13|Act.17.5]]; 
- only referred to as Jason<[[G2394]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ἰάσων</span>\).

Jason is mentioned in Acts 17:5-9 as the host of Paul and Silas during their visit to Thessalonica. He provided lodging for the missionaries while they preached in the city. However, their presence caused an uproar among the Jews who were jealous of Paul's success in converting people to Christianity. A mob formed and attacked Jason's house, seeking to bring Paul and Silas before the city authorities. When they could not find the missionaries, they dragged Jason and some other believers before the city officials, accusing them of harboring those who were defying Caesar's decrees. The officials took security from Jason and the others before releasing them. In [[Rom.16.21|Romans 16:21]], Paul mentions a Jason as one of his fellow workers and relatives who send greetings to the church in Rome. It is unclear whether this is the same Jason who hosted Paul in Thessalonica, but the shared name and association with Paul suggest that it could be the same person.
