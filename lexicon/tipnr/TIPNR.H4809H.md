Meribah-kadesh, also known as Meribah, was a location in the wilderness where the Israelites quarreled with Moses, and Moses disobeyed God \([[Num.20.13|Numbers 20:13]]\). The people complained about the lack of water, and God instructed Moses to speak to the rock to bring forth water. However, Moses struck the rock twice with his staff, and water came out abundantly \(Numbers 20:7-11\). Because Moses and Aaron did not trust and honor God in the sight of the Israelites, they were not allowed to enter the Promised Land \(Numbers 20:12; 27:14; Deuteronomy 32:51\). The incident at Meribah-kadesh is remembered as a time when the Israelites rebelled against God and Moses \(Psalm 81:7; 106:32\). In Ezekiel's vision of the future boundaries of Israel, Meribah-kadesh is mentioned as a point on the southern border \([[Ezek.47.19|Ezekiel 47:19]]; 48:28\).
