Goah is a place mentioned only once in the Bible, in the book of Jeremiah. The reference to Goah occurs within a prophetic passage describing the future restoration and expansion of Jerusalem \([[Jer.31.39|Jeremiah 31:39]]\). According to the prophecy, the measuring line used to define the city's boundaries would extend as far as Goah. This suggests that Goah was located outside the city walls of Jerusalem at the time of Jeremiah's prophecy. The exact location of Goah is unknown, and no other biblical passages provide further information about this place. Its mention in the context of Jerusalem's restoration highlights the idea that the city would experience significant growth and expansion in the future, encompassing areas that were previously outside its limits.
