Zur Zur was one of the five kings of Midian during the time of Moses. He is described as "head of the people of a father's house in Midian" \([[Num.25.15|Numbers 25:15]]\). When the Israelites began to commit harlotry with the women of Moab and Midian, one Israelite man brought a Midianite woman into the camp. Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron, killed both the Israelite man and the Midianite woman, who was the daughter of Zur \(Numbers 25:6-8,14-15\). This act stopped a plague that had broken out among the Israelites as punishment for their sin.
