Elon is mentioned in the genealogies of the Israelites as one of the sons of Zebulun, the tenth son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) \([[Gen.46.14|Gen.46.14]]\). He is listed among the descendants of Jacob who went down to Egypt during the time of Joseph. Later, in the book of Numbers, Elon is identified as the founder of the Elonite clan within the tribe of Zebulun \([[Num.26.26|Num.26.26]]\). The Elonites are mentioned in the census of the Israelites taken in the wilderness of Sinai, indicating that they had become a significant family group within the tribe of Zebulun. The text does not provide any additional details about Elon's life, his role as a clan leader, or the specific history of the Elonites. His inclusion in the genealogies serves to establish the family structure and the development of the tribe of Zebulun from the time of Jacob to the formation of the Israelite nation.
