Segub is mentioned in [[1Kgs.16.34|1 Kings 16:34]] as the father of Hiel the Bethelite. During the reign of King Ahab of Israel, Hiel rebuilt the city of Jericho. This act was in direct disobedience to Joshua's curse pronounced on anyone who would rebuild the city \(Joshua 6:26\). As a result of Hiel's disobedience, his firstborn son Abiram died when he laid the foundation of Jericho, and his youngest son Segub died when he set up its gates. This incident is recorded as a fulfillment of Joshua's words and serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobeying God's commands.
