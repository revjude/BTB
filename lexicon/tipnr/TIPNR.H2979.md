Jeatherai, also referred to as Ethni, is mentioned in [[1Chr.6.21|1 Chronicles 6:21]] and 6:41 as part of the genealogy of the Levites. He was the son of Zerah and is listed as an ancestor of Asaph, one of the principal musicians and psalmists in King David's court. In verse 21, he is called Jeatherai, while in verse 41, he is referred to as Ethni. This discrepancy may be due to variations in spelling or copying of the text over time. As a Levite, Jeatherai would have been part of the tribe dedicated to assisting the priests in the tabernacle and temple services. The genealogies in 1 Chronicles 6 trace the lineage of the Levites, particularly those who served as musicians and singers in the temple worship.
