Joanna is mentioned in [[Luke.8.3|Luke 8:3]] and 24:10 as one of the women who followed Jesus and supported His ministry. She is described as the wife of Chuza, who was a steward in Herod's household. Along with other women, including Mary Magdalene and Susanna, Joanna provided financial support for Jesus and His disciples out of her own means. 

Joanna was also among the women who witnessed Jesus' crucifixion and later went to His tomb on the morning of His resurrection. In [[Luke.24.10|Luke 24:10]], she is named as one of the women who reported the news of the empty tomb and the angels' message to the apostles. Her presence at these key moments in Jesus' life and her support of His ministry indicate her devotion and faith.
