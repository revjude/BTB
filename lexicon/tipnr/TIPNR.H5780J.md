Uz is a region mentioned in the Bible, most prominently as the homeland of Job, the righteous man whose faith was tested through great suffering \([[Job.1.1|Job 1:1]]\). The exact location of Uz is uncertain, but it is believed to be situated east of the land of Israel and Edom, possibly in northern Arabia or southern Jordan. Job's story describes Uz as a place near the desert \([[Job.1.1|Job 1:1]]9\) but also fertile for farming and raising livestock \(Job 1:3, 14; 42:12\). The people of Uz are referred to as "the people of the East" \(Job 1:3\), and the land was vulnerable to Chaldean raiding parties \([[Job.1.1|Job 1:1]]7\). Uz is also mentioned in [[Jer.25.20|Jeremiah 25:20]] among the nations that will drink the cup of God's wrath, and in [[Lam.4.21|Lamentations 4:21]], where Edom is addressed as dwelling in the land of Uz. Some scholars propose that Uz may be a fictional place serving the story of Job rather than a physical land, with the name "Uz" in Hebrew meaning "counsel" or "advice."
