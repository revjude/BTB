Ahijah was a prophet from Shiloh who lived during the reigns of Solomon and Jeroboam I. He is best known for his prophecy to Jeroboam, foretelling the division of the kingdom and Jeroboam's rise as king over ten tribes of Israel. \([[1Kgs.11.29|1Ki.11.29]]-39\) 

Ahijah encountered Jeroboam and symbolically tore his new garment into twelve pieces, giving ten to Jeroboam to represent the ten tribes he would rule. Ahijah also prophesied the downfall of Solomon's dynasty due to idolatry. \([[1Kgs.11.29|1Ki.11.29]]-39\). 

Later, when Jeroboam's son Abijah fell ill, Jeroboam sent his wife in disguise to seek Ahijah's counsel. Ahijah, now blind, received a message from God and predicted the child's death and the destruction of Jeroboam's house for his idolatry. \([[1Kgs.14.2|1Ki.14.2]]-18\) 

Ahijah's prophecies concerning the division of the kingdom and the rise of Jeroboam came to pass, as recorded in both 1 Kings and 2 Chronicles. \([[1Kgs.12.15|1Ki.12.15]]; [[2Chr.10.15|2Ch.10.15]]\) His writings are mentioned as a source for the acts of Solomon. \([[2Chr.9.29|2Ch.9.29]]\)
