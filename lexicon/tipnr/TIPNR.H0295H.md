Ahiezer is mentioned as one of the Benjamite warriors who joined David at Ziklag when he was fleeing from King Saul. Along with his fellow Benjamites, Ahiezer is described as a brave warrior, armed with a bow, and able to shoot arrows and sling stones with either his right or left hand. \(1Ch.12.1-2\) 

These skilled warriors aligned themselves with David and provided valuable military support during his time of exile. The biblical text does not provide any further details about Ahiezer's specific role or exploits in David's army. \([[1Chr.12.3|1Ch.12.3]]\).
