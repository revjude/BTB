Habor was a river located in Assyria, associated with the region of Gozan, where Israelite captives from the northern kingdom were settled by the Assyrians. During the reign of Hoshea, the last king of Israel, the Assyrian king Shalmaneser conquered Samaria and deported the Israelites to various locations in Assyria, including the cities of Halah and Habor, by the river Gozan \([[2Kgs.17.6|2 Kings 17:6]]; 18:11; [[1Chr.5.26|1 Chronicles 5:26]]\). The practice of deporting conquered populations was a common strategy employed by the Assyrians to prevent rebellions and to integrate the conquered peoples into their empire. The exact location of the Habor River is not specified in the Bible, but it is generally identified with the Khabur River, a tributary of the Euphrates River, located in modern-day Syria and Iraq. The Khabur River was known for its fertile lands and was an important region in the Assyrian Empire. The deportation of the Israelites to the region of the Habor River marked the end of the northern kingdom and the beginning of the Assyrian captivity, which had a profound impact on the history and identity of the Israelite people.
