- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.25|Ezr.10.25]]; 
- only referred to as Mijamin **<big>[[H4326|מִיָּמִן]]</big>**.

Mijamin is mentioned in the book of Ezra as one of the Israelites who had married foreign women during the post-exilic period \([[Ezra.10.25|Ezr.10.25]]\). After the return from Babylonian captivity, Ezra discovered that many Israelites, including priests and Levites, had intermarried with the neighboring peoples. This was contrary to God's commands and posed a threat to the spiritual purity of the nation. Ezra called for a assembly, where the people confessed their sin and agreed to separate from their foreign wives \(Ezr.10.1-17\). Mijamin is listed among the descendants of Parosh who had taken foreign wives \([[Ezra.10.25|Ezr.10.25]]\). No further details about Mijamin's life, family, or the specific circumstances of his marriage are provided in the biblical text. His mention serves to illustrate the widespread problem of intermarriage and the steps taken to address it during Ezra's time.
