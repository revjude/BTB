Qere, KJV= Huram\) <[[H2361G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>חו</span>ּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ם</span>\).

Hiram, also known as Huram, was the king of Tyre, a Phoenician city-state located on the Mediterranean coast north of Israel. He is mentioned in several passages in the Old Testament, primarily in connection with his alliances with King David and King Solomon of Israel. 

During David's reign, Hiram sent envoys to David and provided him with cedar logs, carpenters, and stonemasons to build his palace \([[2Sam.5.11|2 Samuel 5:11]]; [[1Chr.14.1|1 Chronicles 14:1]]\). This gesture demonstrated the friendly relationship between Tyre and Israel and Hiram's recognition of David's growing power and influence in the region. 

Hiram's alliance with Israel continued during the reign of Solomon, David's son. He played a significant role in the construction of the First Temple in Jerusalem by supplying Solomon with cedar and cypress logs, as well as skilled craftsmen \(1 Kings 5; [[2Chr.2.3|2 Chronicles 2:3]]-16\). In exchange, Solomon provided Hiram with large quantities of wheat, barley, olive oil, and wine \(1 Kings 5:11; 2 Chronicles 2:10\). 

The two kings also collaborated on maritime expeditions, with Hiram sending his skilled sailors to join Solomon's fleet in voyages to Ophir, a region known for its wealth in gold and other precious items \([[1Kgs.9.27|1 Kings 9:27]]-28; 10:11, 22; [[2Chr.8.18|2 Chronicles 8:18]]; 9:10, 21\). 

In addition to their trade and construction projects, Hiram and Solomon exchanged gifts and engaged in diplomatic relations \(1 Kings 9:11-14; [[2Chr.8.2|2 Chronicles 8:2]]\). Their friendship and cooperation were instrumental in the growth and prosperity of both Tyre and Israel during this period.
