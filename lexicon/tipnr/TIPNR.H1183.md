Bealiah is mentioned in [[1Chr.12.5|1 Chronicles 12:5]] as one of the Benjamite warriors who joined David at Ziklag when he was seeking refuge from King Saul. The context of the passage is a list of the mighty men who supported David during this time, including warriors from various tribes of Israel. Bealiah is described as a Benjamite, indicating his tribal affiliation. The fact that he joined David at Ziklag suggests that he was loyal to David and recognized him as the rightful king, even though Saul, who was also from the tribe of Benjamin, was still on the throne.
