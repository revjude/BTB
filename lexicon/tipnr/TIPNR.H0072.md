Ebenezer, meaning "stone of help," was a memorial stone set up by the prophet Samuel to commemorate a significant victory of the Israelites over the Philistines. The stone was erected between Mizpah and Shen, in the territory of Israel. Prior to this victory, the Israelites had suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of the Philistines, who captured the Ark of the Covenant \([[1Sam.4.1|1 Samuel 4:1]]; 5:1\). The Ark was eventually returned, and Samuel led the Israelites in a ceremony of repentance at Mizpah. When the Philistines attacked again, God intervened on behalf of Israel, causing confusion among the Philistines and leading to their defeat \(1 Samuel 7:7-11\). To commemorate this divine intervention and victory, Samuel set up the stone and named it Ebenezer, acknowledging God's help and deliverance \([[1Sam.7.12|1 Samuel 7:12]]\). The stone served as a reminder to the Israelites of God's faithfulness and power in their battles against their enemies.
