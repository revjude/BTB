- A woman living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Mark.15.40|Mrk.15.40]]; 
- only referred to as Salome **<big>[[G4539|Σαλώμη]]</big>**; 
-  daughter of Heli@Luk.3.23 **<big>[[G2242|Ἡλί]]</big>**; 
- a sister of Mary@Mat.1.16-Act \(?\)G3137G\).

Salome is mentioned in [[Mark.15.40|Mark 15:40]] and 16:1 as one of the women who were present at the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and later went to His tomb on the morning of His resurrection. In [[Mark.15.40|Mark 15:40]], she is described as one of the women who watched the crucifixion from a distance, along with Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the younger and Joses. These women had followed Jesus and cared for His needs during His ministry in Galilee \(Mark 15:41\). After the crucifixion, Salome, along with Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James, bought spices to anoint Jesus' body \([[Mark.16.1|Mark 16:1]]\). They went to the tomb early on the first day of the week, intending to perform this act of devotion. However, when they arrived, they found the stone rolled away and a young man \(an angel\) who informed them that Jesus had risen \(Mark 16:2-6\). The angel instructed them to tell the disciples, especially Peter, that Jesus would meet them in Galilee \(Mark 16:7\). Salome's presence at both the crucifixion and the tomb on the morning of the resurrection highlights her devotion to Jesus and her role as a witness to these crucial events in the Christian faith.
