Azekah was a town in the Shephelah region of Judah, located about 17 miles southwest of Jerusalem. It is first mentioned in [[Josh.10.10|Joshua 10:10]]-11, where the Amorite kings were defeated by Joshua and the Israelites. Azekah was later listed as one of the cities in the allotment of the tribe of Judah \([[Josh.15.35|Joshua 15:35]]\). The Philistines gathered their armies between Socoh and Azekah before the famous battle between David and Goliath \([[1Sam.17.1|1 Samuel 17:1]]\). During the reign of King Rehoboam, Azekah was one of the cities fortified for the defense of Judah \([[2Chr.11.9|2 Chronicles 11:9]]\). After the Babylonian exile, Azekah was reinhabited by the Jews \([[Neh.11.30|Nehemiah 11:30]]\). The city was one of the last two strongholds, along with Lachish, to fall to the Babylonians during the siege of Jerusalem \([[Jer.34.7|Jeremiah 34:7]]\). Archaeological excavations at the site of Tel Azekah have revealed evidence of the city's occupation from the Bronze Age through the Babylonian destruction.
