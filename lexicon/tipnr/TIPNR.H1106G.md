- An Edomite king living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.36.32|Gen.36.32]]; 
- only referred to as Bela **<big>[[H1106|בֶּלַע]]</big>**;

Bela, the son of Beor, is mentioned in [[Gen.36.32|Genesis 36:32]]-33 and [[1Chr.1.43|1 Chronicles 1:43]]-44 as the first king of Edom. The context of these passages is the genealogy of Esau, also known as Edom, and the list of kings who reigned in Edom before Israel had a king. Bela is described as reigning in Edom, with his city named Dinhabah. The mention of Bela as the first king suggests that he played a significant role in establishing the Edomite monarchy. The fact that he reigned before Israel had a king highlights the political development of Edom as a nation.
