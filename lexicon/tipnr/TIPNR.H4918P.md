- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.15|Ezr.10.15]]; 
- only referred to as Meshullam **<big>[[H4918|מְשֻׁלָּם]]</big>**.

Meshullam is mentioned in the book of Ezra as one of two individuals who opposed Ezra's plan to put away foreign wives \([[Ezra.10.15|Ezr.10.15]]\). After Ezra had led the people in confessing their sin of intermarriage with foreign women, he proposed a plan for the men to separate from their foreign wives and children. This plan was met with general agreement, but Meshullam and Jonathan the son of Asahel stood against it. The reason for their opposition is not explicitly stated in the text. Despite their dissent, the plan was carried out, and the men put away their foreign wives.
