Man living at the time of Divided Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Ahlai</span> was the father of Zabad, who was one of David's mighty men. \([[1Chr.11.41|1Ch.11.41]]\)
- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.11.41|1Ch.11.41]]; 
- only referred to as Ahlai **<big>[[H0304|אַחְלַי]]</big>**; 
-  father of Zabad **<big>[[H2066|זָבָד]]</big>**.

Ahlai is mentioned in the context of his son Zabad, who was one of the mighty men of King David. The mighty men were a group of skilled warriors who fought alongside David and played a significant role in establishing and defending his kingdom. \(1Ch.11.10-47\) 

Zabad, the son of Ahlai, is listed among these mighty men, indicating his prowess in battle and his loyalty to King David. \([[1Chr.11.41|1Ch.11.41]]\) However, no specific details about Zabad's exploits or his role in David's army are provided in the biblical text. 

Similarly, no further information is given about Ahlai himself, apart from being identified as Zabad's father. His mention in this context serves to provide a genealogical reference for Zabad and to highlight the family's connection to David's elite group of warriors. 

The inclusion of Zabad in the list of mighty men suggests that he and, by extension, his father Ahlai were part of the tribe of Judah, as many of David's loyal supporters came from his own tribe. However, the biblical text does not explicitly state their tribal affiliation.
