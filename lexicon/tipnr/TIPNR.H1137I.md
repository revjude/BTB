<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Bani</span>, a descendant of Perez, was among those who settled in Jerusalem.
- A man from the tribe of Judah  living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[1Chr.9.4|1Ch.9.4]]; 
- only referred to as Bani **<big>[[H1137|בָּנִי]]</big>**; 
-  father of Imri **<big>[[H0566|אִמְרִי]]</big>**.

Bani is mentioned in [[1Chr.9.4|1 Chronicles 9:4]] as one of the descendants of Perez who settled in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. Perez was one of the twin sons of Judah \(Genesis 38:29\) and an ancestor of the royal line of David \(Ruth 4:18-22\). The context of 1 Chronicles 9 is a list of the families who resettled in Jerusalem and the surrounding towns. Bani's inclusion in this list indicates that he was part of the tribe of Judah and among those who returned from exile to rebuild the city and restore the community.
