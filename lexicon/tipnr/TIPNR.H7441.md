The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 4 lists some of the prominent families and individuals within the tribe of Judah. Rinnah is listed along with his brother Ben-hanan as sons of Shimon. No further information is provided about Rinnah or his role within the tribe. His inclusion in the genealogy serves to document the family lines and descendants of Judah, the fourth son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and Leah, whose tribe became one of the most prominent and influential in Israel's history.
