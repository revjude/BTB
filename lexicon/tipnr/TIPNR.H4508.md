Minni is mentioned in [[Jer.51.27|Jeremiah 51:27]] as a kingdom that is summoned, along with Ararat and Ashkenaz, to join in the battle against Babylon. The exact location of Minni is uncertain, but it is believed to have been a region or kingdom in the vicinity of Armenia or eastern Anatolia. The prophet Jeremiah's oracle against Babylon includes this call to the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz to rise up and contribute to Babylon's downfall. Beyond this single mention, no further details about Minni are provided in the Bible.
