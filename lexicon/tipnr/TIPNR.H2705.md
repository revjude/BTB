Hazar-shual, meaning "village of foxes," was a town located in the Negev, the southern region of the Promised Land. Initially, it was part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Judah during the division of the land under Joshua \(Josh 15:28\). Later, Hazar-shual was among the towns given to the tribe of Simeon within Judah's inheritance \(Josh 19:3; 1 Chr 4:28\). After the Babylonian exile, Hazar-shual was one of the towns inhabited by the returning Jews \([[Neh.11.27|Neh.11.27]]\). Its exact location is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the northwestern Negev, south of the Judean hills.
