Merab was the eldest daughter of King Saul \([[1Sam.14.49|1Sa.14.49]]\). She was initially promised to David as a wife, with the condition that he fight valiantly for Saul and the Lord \([[1Sam.18.17|1Sa.18.17]]\). However, when the time came for her to be given to David, she was instead given to Adriel the Meholathite as a wife \([[1Sam.18.19|1Sa.18.19]]\). Merab had five sons with Adriel, and these sons were among the seven descendants of Saul who were handed over to the Gibeonites for execution, as a means of atonement for Saul's attempt to annihilate the Gibeonites \([[2Sam.21.8|2Sa.21.8]]\). This event occurred during David's reign, when a three-year famine prompted David to seek the Lord's guidance.
