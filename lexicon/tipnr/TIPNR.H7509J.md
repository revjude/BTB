Rephaiah, the son of Hur, is mentioned in [[Neh.3.9|Nehemiah 3:9]] as one of the people who helped repair the wall of Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah. He was the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem, indicating that he held a position of authority in the city. Nehemiah, who served as the governor of Judah under the Persian Empire, led the effort to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, which had been destroyed during the Babylonian conquest. Various individuals and families were assigned to repair specific sections of the wall. Rephaiah was responsible for repairing a section adjacent to the one repaired by Jedaiah, son of Harumaph. The mention of Rephaiah's involvement in the wall's reconstruction highlights the collective effort of the Jewish community to restore and fortify Jerusalem after their return from exile.
