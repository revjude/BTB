- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[2Chr.28.12|2Ch.28.12]]; 
- only referred to as Berechiah **<big>[[H1296|בֶּרֶכְיָה]]</big>**;

Berechiah was an Ephraimite leader who lived during the reign of King Ahaz of Judah. When Pekah, the king of Israel, and his army captured 200,000 Judeans and intended to bring them to Samaria as captives, Berechiah, along with other leaders of Ephraim, strongly opposed this action \(2 Ch. 28:12\). They urged the Israelite army to release the captives, providing them with clothing, food, and medical care before sending them back to Judah \(2 Ch. 28:15\). Berechiah's intervention demonstrates his compassion and his desire to maintain peace and unity among the people of Israel and Judah.
