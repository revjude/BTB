- People from Ezrah\(?\), first mentioned at [[1Kgs.4.31|1Ki.4.31]]; 
- only referred to as Ezrahites **<big>[[H0250|אֶזְרָחִי]]</big>**.

The Ezrahites were a family or clan within the tribe of Judah, descended from Zerah, one of the sons of Judah \(Genesis 38:30; 1 Chronicles 2:4\). They were known for their wisdom and musical abilities. In [[1Kgs.4.31|1 Kings 4:31]], Ethan the Ezrahite is mentioned as one of the wise men whom Solomon surpassed in wisdom. Ethan is also credited with composing Psalm 89 \(Psalm 89:1\). Another notable Ezrahite was Heman, who was a singer and musician in the time of David and is mentioned as the author of Psalm 88 \(Psalm 88:1; 1 Chronicles 6:33\). The Ezrahites' reputation for wisdom and musical skill suggests that they played a significant role in the cultural and religious life of ancient Israel.
