Mehetabel is mentioned in the context of Nehemiah's efforts to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. Shemaiah, a man described as "the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel," was hired by Nehemiah's enemies, Sanballat and Tobiah, to intimidate Nehemiah and hinder the work on the wall. Shemaiah invited Nehemiah to meet with him in the temple and suggested that they close the doors, claiming that there was a plot to kill Nehemiah. However, Nehemiah perceived that Shemaiah was not sent by God and that his prophecy was intended to frighten Nehemiah and discredit him \([[Neh.6.10|Nehemiah 6:10]]-13\). Mehetabel's role in this narrative is limited to being mentioned as an ancestor of Shemaiah, providing context for Shemaiah's background and family lineage.
