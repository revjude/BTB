Buz was the son of Nahor, who was Abraham's brother \(Gen. 22:21\). He was one of Nahor's eight children born to his wife, Milcah. Buz and his siblings were Abraham's nephews and nieces, representing the extended family of the patriarch. The mention of Buz and his siblings in the genealogy of Nahor highlights the importance of family relationships and the preservation of ancestral records. It also provides context for the family background of Abraham, who was called by God to leave his homeland and relatives to go to the land of Canaan. The descendants of Buz, known as the Buzites, are later mentioned in connection with the land of Uz \(Jer. 25:23\), suggesting that they settled in a region east of the Jordan River.
