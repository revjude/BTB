Achim is mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus Christ recorded in the Gospel of Matthew \(Matthew 1:14\). He was the son of Zadok \(or 'Sadoc'\) and the father of Eliud. Achim is listed as one of the ancestors of Jesus in the lineage traced from Abraham through David to Joseph, the husband of Mary, the mother of Jesus. 

Apart from his mention in the genealogy, no other details are provided about Achim's life, his occupation, or any significant events associated with him. His inclusion in the genealogy serves to demonstrate Jesus' connection to the Davidic line and to the promises made to Abraham, emphasizing the continuity of God's plan of redemption throughout Israel's history.
