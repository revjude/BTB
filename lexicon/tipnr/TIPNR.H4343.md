Machbenah is mentioned as a daughter or a town of Sheva in the genealogy of Caleb, the son of Hezron, who was a descendant of Judah \([[1Chr.2.49|1Ch.2.49]]\). The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 2 traces the lineage of Judah and highlights the descendants of Hezron, including Caleb. Machbenah is listed as one of the descendants of Caleb, along with several other individuals and clans. No further information is provided about Machbenah's life, occupation, or role in the biblical narrative. The mention of Machbenah in this genealogical record serves to establish the continuity of Caleb's lineage and the growth of his clan within the tribe of Judah. As with many individuals mentioned in biblical genealogies, the lack of additional details about Machbenah suggests that the primary purpose of the mention is to maintain the historical record of the family line.
