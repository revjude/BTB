Woman living at the time of United Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Peninnah</span>, one of Elkanah's two wives and the rival of Hannah, Samuel's mother.
- A woman living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at 1Sa.1.2; 
- only referred to as Peninnah<[[H6444]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>פ</span>ְּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ָּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>\); 
- wife of Elkanah<[[H0511H]]>.

Peninnah was one of the two wives of Elkanah, an Ephraimite man, and the rival of Hannah, according to 1 Samuel 1:2. Peninnah had children, while Hannah was initially barren. Elkanah would give portions of the sacrificial meat to Peninnah and her children, but he would give a double portion to Hannah because he loved her \([[1Sam.1.4|1 Samuel 1:4]]-5\). Peninnah would provoke and irritate Hannah because of her barrenness, causing Hannah great distress \(1 Samuel 1:6-7\). This rivalry between the two wives highlights the challenges of polygamy and the importance of children in ancient Israelite society. Peninnah's actions also serve as a contrast to Hannah's faith and prayerful response to her situation.
