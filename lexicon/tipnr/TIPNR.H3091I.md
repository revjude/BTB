Joshua is mentioned in [[2Kgs.23.8|2 Kings 23:8]] as the governor of Jerusalem during the reign of King Josiah. The context of the passage is Josiah's religious reforms, which took place in the late 7th century BC \(2 Kings 22-23\). As part of these reforms, Josiah removed pagan worship sites and practices from Judah and Jerusalem. The high places that the kings of Judah had made at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the governor of the city, were among those removed. These high places were likely dedicated to pagan deities and were located near Joshua's official residence or administrative building.
