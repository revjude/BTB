Chinneroth, or Chinnereth, is mentioned in the Bible as both a region and a city located near the Sea of Galilee, which was also known as the Sea of Chinnereth or the Lake of Gennesaret. In [[Josh.11.2|Joshua 11:2]], Chinneroth is listed as one of the areas where the kings of the northern Canaanite cities gathered to fight against Joshua and the Israelites. 

In [[Josh.19.35|Joshua 19:35]], Chinnereth is mentioned as one of the fortified cities allotted to the tribe of Naphtali during the division of the Promised Land. This suggests that Chinnereth was a significant city in the region during the time of the conquest and settlement of Canaan. 

The Sea of Chinnereth, later known as the Sea of Galilee, was named after the city or region of Chinnereth \(Numbers 34:11; Deuteronomy 3:17\). This sea played a crucial role in the ministry of Jesus Christ, as he performed many miracles and taught in the towns and villages along its shores. 

In [[1Kgs.15.20|1 Kings 15:20]], during the reign of King Baasha of Israel, Ben-hadad, the king of Syria, attacked several cities in northern Israel, including "all Chinneroth," referring to the region around the Sea of Galilee. This event demonstrates the strategic importance of the Chinneroth region in the geopolitical landscape of ancient Israel.
