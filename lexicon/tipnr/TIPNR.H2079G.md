- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.28|Ezr.10.28]]; 
- only referred to as Zabbai **<big>[[H2079|זַבַּי]]</big>**.

Zabbai, of the sons of Bebai, is listed among the men who had taken foreign wives during the Babylonian exile. This issue was brought to light when Ezra, the priest and scribe, returned to Jerusalem and discovered that many Israelites had intermarried with the pagan peoples of the land, going against God's command. Zabbai was one of those who had married a foreign woman. When Ezra called for repentance, Zabbai and the others agreed to separate from their foreign wives and children to maintain the holiness of the Jewish people.
