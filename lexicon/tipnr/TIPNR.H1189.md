Baal-zephon is mentioned in [[Exod.14.2|Exodus 14:2]], 9, and [[Num.33.7|Numbers 33:7]] as a place near where the Israelites camped before crossing the Red Sea during their exodus from Egypt. God instructed Moses to have the people turn back and camp near Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, opposite Baal-zephon \([[Exod.14.2|Exodus 14:2]]\). The Egyptians caught up with the Israelites as they were camped by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon \([[Exod.14.9|Exodus 14:9]]\). The exact location of Baal-zephon is uncertain, but it was likely situated on the western shore of the Gulf of Suez, near the northern tip of the Red Sea. The name "Baal-zephon" means "Lord of the North" or "Baal of the North," possibly referring to a local deity worshipped by the Egyptians in that area.
