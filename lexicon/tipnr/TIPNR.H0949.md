Bozez is mentioned in [[1Sam.14.4|1 Samuel 14:4]] as one of the two rocky crags that Jonathan, King Saul's son, and his armor-bearer had to cross to reach the Philistine garrison at Michmash. The other crag was called Seneh. These crags were sharp and difficult to traverse, providing a natural defense for the Philistine outpost. Despite the challenging terrain, Jonathan and his armor-bearer successfully crossed the crags and launched a surprise attack on the Philistines, which led to a significant victory for Israel.
