Achzib was a coastal town allotted to the tribe of Asher \([[Josh.19.29|Joshua 19:29]]\). However, Asher failed to drive out the Canaanite inhabitants of Achzib, so they continued to live among the Israelites \([[Judg.1.31|Judges 1:31]]\). This Achzib is distinct from the town of the same name in Judah. Its location is generally identified with the modern city of Ez-Zib, about 10 miles \(16 km\) north of Acco \(Ptolemais\) on the Mediterranean coast of northern Israel. As a coastal settlement, Achzib was likely involved in maritime trade and commerce. The Canaanites' continued presence in Achzib reflects the challenges Israel faced in completely possessing the Promised Land.
