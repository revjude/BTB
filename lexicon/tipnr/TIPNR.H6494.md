King living at the time of Divided Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Pekahiah</span>, son of Menahem, king of Israel who reigned for 2 years before being assassinated.
- A king of Northern Israel, living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Kgs.15.22|2Ki.15.22]]; 
- only referred to as Pekahiah **<big>[[H6494|פְּקַחְיָה]]</big>**; 
- a son of Menahem **<big>[[H4505|מְנַחֵם]]</big>**.

Pekahiah son of Menahem was king of Israel for 2 years, according to [[2Kgs.15.22|2 Kings 15:22]]-23. He succeeded his father Menahem but continued in his father's sinful ways. Pekahiah's reign was cut short when his officer Pekah son of Remaliah conspired against him and assassinated him in the citadel of the king's palace in Samaria \(2 Kings 15:25\). Pekah then became king in his place. Pekahiah's short reign reflects the political instability and moral decline of the northern kingdom of Israel.
