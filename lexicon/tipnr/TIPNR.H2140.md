- only referred to as Zaccai<[[H2140]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ז</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>כ</span>ַּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>\).

Zaccai is mentioned in the lists of Jewish exiles who returned to Jerusalem from Babylon. In the accounts found in both Ezra and Nehemiah, the descendants of Zaccai are enumerated among the families who made the journey back to their homeland. The Ezra account records 760 members of Zaccai's family, while Nehemiah's list mentions 760. These numbers suggest that the family of Zaccai was a significant group among the returning exiles who helped rebuild Jerusalem and restore Jewish community life in the post-exilic period.
