Phinehas was a priest who served during the time of Ezra, the scribe and priest who led a group of exiles back to Jerusalem from Babylon \([[Ezra.8.33|Ezra 8:33]]\). When Ezra and his companions arrived in Jerusalem, they delivered the gold, silver, and vessels that had been donated for the service of the temple to the priests and Levites. Phinehas, along with several other priests, was responsible for weighing and recording these items, ensuring that everything was accounted for and properly stored in the chambers of the temple. This event took place on the fourth day after their arrival in Jerusalem, demonstrating the importance of maintaining accurate records and the proper handling of the temple's resources.
