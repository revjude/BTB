The Fountain Gate was one of the gates in the wall of Jerusalem, mentioned in the Book of Nehemiah in connection with the city's rebuilding efforts after the Babylonian exile. It is believed to have been located on the southeastern side of the city, possibly near the Pool of Siloam or the King's Garden. 

In [[Neh.2.14|Nehemiah 2:14]], during Nehemiah's nighttime inspection of the city's walls, he passed by the Fountain Gate and noted its state of disrepair. Later, in [[Neh.3.15|Nehemiah 3:15]], Shallun, the son of Col-hozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah, is recorded as having repaired the Fountain Gate. He rebuilt it, covered it, and set its doors, bolts, and bars in place. Additionally, he repaired the wall of the Pool of Shelah \(Siloam\) by the King's Garden, as far as the stairs that went down from the City of David. 

The Fountain Gate is also mentioned in [[Neh.12.37|Nehemiah 12:37]], where it is described as a location along the route of the procession of dedication for the rebuilt wall of Jerusalem. The procession, led by Ezra and Nehemiah, started at the Fountain Gate and proceeded to the Water Gate, then to the Sheep Gate, and finally to the Temple. 

The name "Fountain Gate" suggests that it may have been located near a water source, possibly the Gihon Spring or the Pool of Siloam, which were important for Jerusalem's water supply. Its proximity to the King's Garden also indicates that it was in an area of the city associated with royalty and agriculture. 

The rebuilding of the Fountain Gate during Nehemiah's time was part of the larger effort to restore Jerusalem and its walls after the Babylonian exile. The participation of Shallun in repairing this gate demonstrates the community's involvement in the rebuilding process and the importance of each section of the wall being restored by different individuals and groups.
