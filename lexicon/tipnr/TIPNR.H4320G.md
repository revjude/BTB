Micaiah, also known as Micah, was a Levite who lived during the reign of King Josiah of Judah \([[2Kgs.22.12|2Ki.22.12]]; [[2Chr.34.20|2Ch.34.20]]\). When the Book of the Law was discovered during the repair of the temple, Josiah sent a delegation, which included Micaiah, to inquire of the Lord concerning the words of the book. The delegation went to the prophetess Huldah, who delivered a message of judgment for Judah's disobedience but also affirmed that Josiah's repentance had been heard by the Lord \(2Ki.22.14-20; 2Ch.34.22-28\). Micaiah's inclusion in this delegation suggests that he was a trusted Levite in Josiah's court. His role in seeking the Lord's guidance demonstrates the importance of inquiring of God and heeding His word.
