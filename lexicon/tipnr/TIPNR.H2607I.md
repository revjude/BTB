- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.20|Ezr.10.20]]; 
- only referred to as Hanani **<big>[[H2607|חֲנָנִי]]</big>**.

Hanani is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.20|Ezra 10:20]] as one of the men who had returned from the Babylonian exile and had married foreign wives. During the time of Ezra, the Israelites who had returned to Jerusalem were found to have intermarried with the neighboring peoples, going against God's command to maintain their purity and separation. Ezra, a priest and scribe, led a reform to address this issue. He called an assembly and urged the people to confess their sin and separate themselves from their foreign wives. Hanani was among those listed who had taken foreign wives and pledged to put them away. This event demonstrates the importance of obedience to God's laws and the need for the returned exiles to maintain their distinct identity as God's chosen people.
