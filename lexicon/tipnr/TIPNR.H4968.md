Methuselah, the son of Enoch and the grandfather of Noah, is recognized as the oldest person mentioned in the Bible. He lived an astonishing 969 years \([[Gen.5.27|Gen.5.27]]\). Methuselah's father, Enoch, walked with God and was taken by Him at the age of 365 \([[Gen.5.21|Gen.5.21]]-24\). Methuselah's long life is seen as a symbol of God's patience and mercy in delaying the judgment of the flood until after his death. His name is mentioned in the genealogies of both Chronicles \([[1Chr.1.3|1Ch.1.3]]\) and Luke \([[Luke.3.37|Luk.3.37]]\), emphasizing his importance in the lineage of the Messiah. Although little is known about Methuselah's personal life or character, his exceptional longevity stands as a testament to God's sovereignty and the reliability of His word.
