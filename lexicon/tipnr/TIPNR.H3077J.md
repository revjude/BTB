Jehoiada is mentioned in [[Jer.29.26|Jeremiah 29:26]] as an overseer in the house of the Lord. In a letter sent from the false prophet Shemaiah to the priest Zephaniah, Shemaiah criticizes Zephaniah for not rebuking Jeremiah and appointing Jehoiada as an overseer in the temple. The context suggests that Jehoiada was a contemporary of Jeremiah and held a position of authority in the temple. However, the text does not provide any further details about Jehoiada's background, his specific duties, or his relationship with Jeremiah. The mention of his name in this letter indicates that he was a known figure in the religious establishment of Jerusalem during the time of the prophet Jeremiah.
