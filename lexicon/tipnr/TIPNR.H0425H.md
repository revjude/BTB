King living at the time of Divided Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Elah</span>, son of Baasha, was king of Israel for two years.
- A king living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Kgs.16.6|1Ki.16.6]]; 
- only referred to as Elah **<big>[[H0425|אֵלָה]]</big>**; 
- a son of Baasha **<big>[[H1201|בַּעְשָׁא]]</big>**.

Elah was the son of Baasha and became the fourth king of Israel, ruling for two years \([[1Kgs.16.8|1 Kings 16:8]]\). He ascended to the throne after the death of his father, who had ruled for 24 years. Elah's reign was marked by his evil deeds and his continuation of the sins of his father, leading Israel astray from God \([[1Kgs.16.13|1 Kings 16:13]]\). While Elah was drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, his steward in Tirzah, Zimri, one of his officials, conspired against him and killed him \(1 Kings 16:9-10\). Zimri then succeeded Elah as king. The death of Elah marked the end of the dynasty of Baasha, fulfilling the prophecy of Jehu against Baasha's house \(1 Kings 16:3-4, 11-14\).
