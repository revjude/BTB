Zaphon has two distinct meanings in the Bible. First, it is the name of a city allotted to the tribe of Gad in the division of the Promised Land \(Josh. 13:27\). This city was located in the Jordan Valley, near the Sea of Chinnereth \(Galilee\). Second, Zaphon is used as a term for the north or the heavenly dwelling place of God. In Psalm 48:2, Mount Zion is described as being "in the far north," using the term "Zaphon" to emphasize its sacred status. In [[Isa.14.13|Isaiah 14:13]], the king of Babylon is portrayed as aspiring to ascend to heaven and sit on the mount of assembly "in the far reaches of the north" \(Zaphon\), symbolizing his desire to usurp God's authority. The term "Zaphon" is also mentioned in [[Judg.12.1|Judges 12:1]], where the Ephraimites gathered in Zaphon before confronting Jephthah. The dual usage of Zaphon in the Bible highlights the interplay between physical locations and spiritual symbolism in the biblical narrative.
