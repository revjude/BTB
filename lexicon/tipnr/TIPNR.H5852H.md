Ataroth was a town located on the border between the tribal territories of Ephraim and Manasseh, as described in the book of Joshua. In [[Josh.16.2|Joshua 16:2]], Ataroth is mentioned as part of the southern border of Ephraim, extending from Bethel to Ataroth. Later, in [[Josh.16.7|Joshua 16:7]], Ataroth is listed among the towns marking the northern border of Ephraim, adjacent to the territory of Manasseh. 

The exact location of Ataroth is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the hill country of central Canaan, west of the Jordan River. Its mention in the boundary descriptions of Ephraim and Manasseh suggests that it was a significant landmark or settlement in the region during the time of the Israelite conquest and settlement of the Promised Land. 

Apart from its inclusion in the territorial allotments of Ephraim and Manasseh, no other details about Ataroth are provided in the biblical text. Its primary significance lies in its role as a boundary marker, helping to delineate the extent of the tribal territories in the heartland of ancient Israel.
