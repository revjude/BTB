Mahalath, also referred to as Basemath, was one of the wives of Esau, the son of Isaac and the twin brother of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) \([[Gen.28.9|Gen.28.9]]; 36.3\). She was the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son with Hagar, making her Esau's cousin \([[Gen.28.9|Gen.28.9]]\). Esau married Mahalath in addition to his other wives, who were Hittite women \(Gen.26.34; 28.8-9\). This marriage likely strengthened the ties between Esau's descendants, the Edomites, and the Ishmaelites. Mahalath is mentioned in the genealogies of Esau, which list his wives, children, and descendants \([[Gen.36.4|Gen.36.4]],10,13,17\). These genealogies emphasize the importance of family lineage and the relationships between different people groups in the ancient Near East. The Bible does not provide further details about Mahalath's personal life or her role in the family dynamics of Esau's household. Her inclusion in the biblical record primarily serves to document Esau's marital alliances and the ancestry of the Edomites.
