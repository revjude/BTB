Shaphan, mentioned in 2 Kings 22, 25.22, 2 Chronicles 34, and several passages in Jeremiah, was a scribe who served during the reign of King Josiah of Judah. He was the son of Azaliah and the father of Ahikam, Elasah, and Gemariah. Shaphan played a key role in the religious reforms initiated by Josiah. When the high priest Hilkiah discovered the Book of the Law in the temple, he gave it to Shaphan, who then read it to the king. This event led to a nationwide renewal of the covenant and the implementation of reforms to purge idolatry from Judah. Shaphan's sons, particularly Ahikam, continued to serve in important positions during the reigns of subsequent kings. During the Babylonian invasion and the fall of Jerusalem, Shaphan's family members were involved in various events, such as the release of Jeremiah from prison and the appointment of Gedaliah as governor over the remnant of Judah. The multiple references to Shaphan and his descendants highlight their significance in the religious and political affairs of Judah during this tumultuous period.
