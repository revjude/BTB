There are two places named Ophrah mentioned in the Bible: 

Ophrah of Manasseh: This Ophrah was the hometown of Gideon, one of the judges of Israel \(Judg. 6:11\). It was here that the Angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon and commissioned him to deliver Israel from the Midianites \(Judg. 6:11-24\). Gideon built an altar to the Lord in Ophrah and destroyed the altar of Baal \(Judg. 6:24-27\). After his victory over the Midianites, Gideon made an ephod from the spoils of war and placed it in Ophrah, which became a snare to him and his family \(Judg. 8:27\). Gideon died and was buried in Ophrah \(Judg. 8:32\). Later, Gideon's son Abimelech killed his seventy brothers in Ophrah \(Judg. 9:5\). The exact location of this Ophrah is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the region of Manasseh, west of the Jordan River. 

Ophrah of Issachar: This Ophrah was a town allotted to the tribe of Issachar during the division of the Promised Land \(Josh. 19:19\). It is listed along with other towns in the region, such as Jezreel, Chesulloth, and Shunem. Its location is unknown.
