- A woman living at the time of the Patriarchs, only mentioned at [[Gen.26.34|Gen.26.34]]; 
- only referred to as Judith<[[H3067]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>הו</span>ּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ית</span>\); 
- a daughter of Beeri<[[H0882G]]>; 
- wife of Esau<[[H6215G]]>.

Judith is mentioned in [[Gen.26.34|Genesis 26:34]] as one of the wives of Esau, the son of Isaac and Rebekah. She was the daughter of Beeri the Hittite and is described as a Hittite woman. 

The context of the passage is the account of Esau's marriages, which caused grief to his parents \([[Gen.26.34|Genesis 26:34]]-35\). Esau, at the age of forty, married Judith and another Hittite woman named Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite \([[Gen.26.34|Genesis 26:34]]\). 

These marriages were a source of bitterness to Isaac and Rebekah because the Hittites were not part of the covenant people of God \(Genesis 26:35\). The Hittites were one of the Canaanite tribes that inhabited the Promised Land before the Israelites, and God had commanded the Israelites not to intermarry with them \(Deuteronomy 7:1-4\). 

Esau's choice to marry Hittite women demonstrated his disregard for the covenant and his parents' wishes, setting the stage for the conflict between him and his brother Israel \(or 'Jacob'\), who was chosen by God to inherit the covenant promises \(Genesis 25:23; 27:1-29\).
