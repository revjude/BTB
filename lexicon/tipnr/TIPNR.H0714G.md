Ard is mentioned in the genealogy of Benjamin, one of the twelve sons of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\), in [[Gen.46.21|Genesis 46:21]]. He is listed as a son of Bela, who was one of Benjamin's sons. This genealogy is given in the context of Jacob's family migrating to Egypt during the time of famine, at the invitation of Joseph, who had risen to a position of authority in Egypt. 

The mention of Ard in this genealogy serves to highlight the growth and development of the Israelite clan, even as they prepared to leave their homeland for Egypt. It also emphasizes the continuity of God's promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as their descendants multiplied and began to fulfill the divine plan for their nation. 

Apart from this mention in the genealogy, no further information is provided about Ard in the biblical text. His inclusion in the record of Benjamin's descendants suggests that he was part of the foundation for the future tribe of Benjamin within the nation of Israel.
