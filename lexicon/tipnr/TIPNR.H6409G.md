Paltiel, son of Azzan, was the leader from the tribe of Issachar appointed by Moses to help divide the land of Canaan among the Israelite tribes \([[Num.34.26|Numbers 34:26]]\). After the conquest of Canaan under Joshua's leadership, the land was to be allocated to the tribes according to their size and needs. Moses, before his death, selected a leader from each tribe to assist Eleazar the priest and Joshua in this task. Paltiel was chosen to represent the tribe of Issachar in this process. His appointment demonstrates the importance of tribal representation and the involvement of leaders from each tribe in the decision-making process. The division of the land was a significant event in the history of Israel, as it marked the fulfillment of God's promise to give the land to His people and the establishment of the tribal territories.
