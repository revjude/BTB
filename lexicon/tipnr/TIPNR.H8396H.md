Tabor is mentioned in [[1Sam.10.3|1 Samuel 10:3]] as an oak tree near Bethel. It appears in the context of Samuel's prophetic message to Saul, who had been anointed as king over Israel. Samuel told Saul that he would meet three men by the oak of Tabor, and they would offer him two loaves of bread. This encounter was one of the signs given to Saul to confirm his divine appointment as king. The oak of Tabor served as a landmark in the region, but no further details about its significance are provided in the Bible.
