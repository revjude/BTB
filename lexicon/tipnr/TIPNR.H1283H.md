Beriah was a son of Ephraim, the younger son of Joseph, born after a tragic event in the family's history \(1 Ch. 7:23\). The men of Gath, who were native to the land, had killed Ephraim's other sons when they went down to raid the Gathites' livestock. In response to this loss, Ephraim named his next son Beriah, which means "misfortune" or "tragedy," because of the calamity that had befallen his house. This event highlights the challenges and conflicts faced by the Israelites as they settled in Canaan and interacted with the local populations.
