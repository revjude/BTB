- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.43|Ezr.10.43]]; 
- only referred to as Zebina **<big>[[H2081|זְבִינָא]]</big>**.

Zebina is mentioned in the list of Israelites who had married foreign women during the time of Ezra. After the return from the Babylonian exile, Ezra discovered that many of the Israelites, including priests and Levites, had intermarried with the neighboring peoples. This was contrary to the Law of Moses and posed a threat to the spiritual purity of the community. Ezra called for an assembly where the people confessed their sin and agreed to separate from their foreign wives. Zebina, along with the other men who had married foreign women, pledged to put away their wives and offer a ram as a guilt offering for their transgression. This act of repentance and obedience was crucial in preserving the identity and faith of the Israelites after the exile.
