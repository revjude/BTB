Pahath-moab is mentioned as one of the individuals who participated in the repair of the wall of Jerusalem under Nehemiah's leadership \([[Neh.3.11|Nehemiah 3:11]]\). He is described as repairing a section of the wall, along with Hashub, the son of Pahath-moab. This suggests that Pahath-moab was not only an individual but also the head of a family or clan that bore his name. The repair of the wall was a significant event in the history of the Jewish people, as it symbolized the restoration of Jerusalem and the renewal of the covenant community after the Babylonian exile. Pahath-moab's participation in this project demonstrates his commitment to the well-being of the community and his willingness to contribute to the rebuilding efforts.
