Zadok was a significant figure in the history of Israel, serving as a high priest during the reigns of King David and King Solomon. He first appears in the biblical narrative as one of the two priests mentioned alongside Ahimelech during David's reign. Zadok remained loyal to David during the rebellion of Absalom, and he played a key role in anointing Solomon as king. After Solomon's accession to the throne, Zadok was appointed as the sole high priest, replacing Abiathar. Zadok's descendants continued to serve as high priests in the temple in Jerusalem, and they are mentioned in the visions of Ezekiel regarding the future restoration of the temple and its services. The "sons of Zadok" are described as faithful priests who will serve in the restored temple. Zadok's lineage and role emphasize the importance of the priesthood in maintaining the worship of God and the spiritual leadership of the nation.
