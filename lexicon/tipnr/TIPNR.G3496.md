Neapolis was a port city on the Aegean coast of Macedonia, near the border with Thrace. It is mentioned in the New Testament as the place where the apostle Paul and his companions \(Silas, Timothy, and Luke\) landed on their first journey to Europe \(Acts 16:11\). After sailing from Troas, they arrived at Neapolis and then went to Philippi, a leading city in the district of Macedonia. Neapolis served as the seaport for Philippi, which was located about 10 miles inland. Today, Neapolis is known as Kavala, a city in northeastern Greece.
