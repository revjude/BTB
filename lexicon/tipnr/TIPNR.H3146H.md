Joshaphat is mentioned in [[1Chr.15.24|1 Chronicles 15:24]] as one of the priests who blew trumpets before the ark of the covenant as it was being brought to Jerusalem. This event took place during the reign of King David, as he sought to establish Jerusalem as the religious and political center of Israel \(1 Chronicles 15:1-16:3\). The ark, which symbolized God's presence among His people, was carried by the Levites and accompanied by musicians and singers. The priests, including Joshaphat, played a special role in this procession by blowing trumpets, which were used in religious ceremonies and to signal important events \(Numbers 10:1-10\).
