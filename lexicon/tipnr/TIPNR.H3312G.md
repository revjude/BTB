Jephunneh, a Kenizzite, was the father of Caleb, a prominent figure in the Old Testament. Caleb was chosen as one of the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan. Along with Joshua, Caleb was one of the two spies who brought back a positive report and encouraged the Israelites to trust in God and take possession of the land. As a result, Caleb and Joshua were the only two adults from their generation permitted to enter Canaan. Jephunneh's Kenizzite background suggests that he may have been a descendant of the Kenizzites, a non-Israelite tribe that was later absorbed into the tribe of Judah. Caleb's inheritance in the Promised Land, including Hebron and its surrounding areas, is mentioned multiple times in connection with Jephunneh, emphasizing the faithfulness and obedience of this father-son duo.
