Karkor was a location east of the Jordan River where Gideon, a judge of Israel, pursued and defeated the Midianite kings Zebah and Zalmunna \([[Judg.8.10|Judges 8:10]]\). After Gideon's initial victory over the Midianites, he learned that Zebah and Zalmunna had escaped with about 15,000 men. Gideon and his 300 men pursued them to Karkor, where they launched a surprise attack and captured the two kings. The exact location of Karkor is not known, but it was likely situated in the region of Gilead, east of the Jordan River.
