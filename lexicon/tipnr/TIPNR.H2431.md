Helam was a place east of the Jordan River where a significant battle took place between the forces of King David and the Arameans \(2 Sam 10:16-17\). The Arameans, under the leadership of Hadadezer, king of Zobah, had gathered their troops at Helam to fight against Israel. David led his army to confront the Arameans and defeated them decisively, causing them to flee. The exact location of Helam is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the region of Zobah, a powerful Aramean kingdom northeast of Israel.
