The King's Highway was an ancient trade route that ran through the kingdoms of Edom and Moab, east of the Jordan River. It was a vital commercial and military route connecting Egypt, Arabia, and Mesopotamia. During the Israelites' journey from Egypt to Canaan, Moses sent messengers to the kings of Edom and Sihon, requesting passage along the King's Highway \([[Num.20.17|Numbers 20:17]]; 21:22\). The Israelites promised to stay on the highway and not disturb the fields or vineyards, but both kings refused to grant them passage. As a result, the Israelites had to detour around Edom and defeat Sihon in battle to continue their journey. The King's Highway played a significant role in the region's history and is still identifiable in parts of modern-day Jordan.
