Hara is a place mentioned in the Bible where some of the Israelite tribes were exiled by the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser. In [[1Chr.5.26|1 Chronicles 5:26]], it is recorded that Tiglath-pileser carried away the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the river of Gozan. The exact location of Hara is uncertain, but it is believed to be in the region of Media, as suggested by the Septuagint's rendering of "ore Medon" \(mountains of the Medes\) and the additional phrase "and in the cities of the Medes" found in 2 Kings 17:6 and 18:11, where Hara is omitted from the list of places. The deportation of these Israelite tribes to Hara and other locations was part of the Assyrian policy of resettling conquered populations to prevent rebellions and to integrate them into the empire.
