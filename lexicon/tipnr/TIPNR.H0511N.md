Elkanah is mentioned as a palace officer who served under King Ahaz of Judah \([[2Chr.28.7|2Ch.28.7]]\). He held the position of being "next to the king," indicating his high rank and close proximity to the monarch. During a battle between Judah and Israel, Elkanah was killed by Zichri, a mighty warrior from the tribe of Ephraim. The text mentions Elkanah's death alongside the deaths of Maaseiah, the king's son, and Azrikam, the officer in charge of the palace. The inclusion of Elkanah in this list suggests that he was a significant figure in the royal court and that his death was a notable loss for the kingdom of Judah.
