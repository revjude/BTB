- A man living before Israel's Monarchy, only mentioned at [[Judg.8.20|Jdg.8.20]]; 
- only referred to as Jether **<big>[[H3500|יֶתֶר]]</big>**; 
-  son of Gideon **<big>[[H1439|גִּדְעוֹן]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Abimelech **<big>[[H0040|אֲבִימֶלֶךְ]]</big>** and Jotham **<big>[[H3147|יוֹתָם]]</big>**.

Jether was the firstborn son of Gideon, the judge of Israel who delivered the Israelites from Midianite oppression. After Gideon defeated the Midianite kings Zebah and Zalmunna, he commanded Jether to kill them. However, Jether was still a youth and was afraid to carry out the execution. As a result, Gideon himself killed the Midianite kings. This incident highlights Jether's youth and inexperience, as well as Gideon's role as a strong leader and warrior.
