Shobab is mentioned in [[2Sam.5.14|2 Samuel 5:14]] and [[1Chr.3.5|1 Chronicles 3:5]] and 14:4 as one of the sons born to David and Bathsheba in Jerusalem. He was born after the death of their first child, who was conceived through an adulterous relationship. Shobab's birth is listed along with his brothers, including Solomon, who would later succeed David as king. Being born in Jerusalem indicates that Shobab was born after David had established the city as his capital and the center of his kingdom.
