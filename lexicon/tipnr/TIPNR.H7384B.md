<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Riphath</span> was a son of Gomer and grandson of Japheth, mentioned in the Table of Nations.
- A man of the Gomerians living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.10.3|Gen.10.3]]; 
- referred to as Riphath **<big>[[H7384|רִיפַת]]</big>**, or Riphath **<big>[[H7384|רִיפַת]]</big>**; 
-  son of Gomer **<big>[[H1586|גֹּמֶר]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Ashkenaz **<big>[[H0813|אַשְׁכְּנַז]]</big>** and Togarmah **<big>[[H8425|תּוֹגַרְמָה]]</big>**.

Riphath is mentioned in [[Gen.10.3|Genesis 10:3]] and [[1Chr.1.6|1 Chronicles 1:6]] as one of the sons of Gomer, who was a son of Japheth. He is listed alongside his brothers Ashkenaz and Togarmah in the Table of Nations, which records the descendants of Noah's sons after the Great Flood \(Genesis 10:1-32\). The descendants of Japheth are generally associated with the peoples of Europe and Asia Minor. While the exact identity and location of the People from Riphath are uncertain, some scholars have proposed connections with the Riphean Mountains, a legendary mountain range mentioned by classical authors, or with the Paphlagonians, an ancient people who lived in the northern part of Asia Minor. However, these identifications remain speculative due to the limited information provided in the biblical text. The inclusion of Riphath in the Table of Nations highlights the diversity of peoples and nations that emerged from the descendants of Noah and their dispersal across the earth after the Flood.
