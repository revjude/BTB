Hotham the Aroerite is mentioned in [[1Chr.11.44|1 Chronicles 11:44]] as one of David's mighty warriors. He is listed among the group of soldiers known for their bravery and military prowess. 

The mighty warriors were an elite group of soldiers who fought alongside David and played a significant role in his military campaigns and the establishment of his kingdom. They were known for their strength, skill, and loyalty to David. 

Hotham is specifically identified as an Aroerite, which likely refers to his place of origin, the city of Aroer. There were two cities named Aroer in the Bible, one located in the territory of Gad \(Numbers 32:34\) and another in the territory of Judah \(1 Samuel 30:28\). 

Apart from being listed among David's mighty warriors, no other information is provided about Hotham in the Bible. His inclusion in this list highlights his reputation as a skilled soldier and his contribution to David's military successes.
