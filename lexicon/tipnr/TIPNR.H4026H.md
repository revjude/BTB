The Tower of the Hundred, also known as the Tower of Meah, is mentioned twice in the book of Nehemiah in the context of rebuilding Jerusalem's walls. In Nehemiah 3:1, it is recorded that the high priest Eliashib and his fellow priests rebuilt the Sheep Gate and consecrated it, continuing their work as far as the Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel. The tower is mentioned again in Nehemiah 12:39, where it is listed among the landmarks along the route of the dedication procession for the newly rebuilt walls. The exact location of the Tower of the Hundred is not specified, but it was likely situated on the northern side of Jerusalem, in close proximity to the Tower of Hananel and the Sheep Gate. The significance of the name "Tower of the Hundred" is uncertain, but it may have referred to the tower's height, the number of its steps, or the number of soldiers stationed there.
