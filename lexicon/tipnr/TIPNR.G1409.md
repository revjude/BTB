- A woman living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[1Sam.22.22|Act.24.24]]; 
- only referred to as Drusilla **<big>[[G1409|Δρούσιλλα]]</big>**; 
- wife of Felix **<big>[[G5344|Φῆλιξ]]</big>**.

Drusilla is mentioned in Acts 24:24 as the wife of Felix, the Roman governor of Judea. She was present when Felix summoned Paul to hear him speak about his faith in Christ. 

Drusilla was the daughter of Herod Agrippa I, who was the grandson of Herod the Great and the king of Judea from 41 to 44 AD. She was born around 38 AD and was known for her beauty and her tumultuous personal life. 

According to the Jewish historian Josephus, Drusilla was originally married to Azizus, the king of Emesa, who had agreed to be circumcised in order to marry her. However, Felix, who was captivated by her beauty, persuaded her to leave her husband and marry him instead. This was seen as a scandalous act, as it violated Jewish law and custom. 

When Paul spoke to Felix and Drusilla about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became frightened and sent Paul away, saying he would summon him again when it was convenient \(Acts 24:25\). This suggests that Paul's message had a profound impact on Felix.
