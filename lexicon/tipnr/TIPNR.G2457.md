- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Rom.16.15|Act.27.1]]; 
- only referred to as Julius **<big>[[G2457|Ἰούλιος]]</big>**.

Julius is mentioned in Acts 27:1 and 27:3 as a centurion of the Augustan Cohort who was responsible for escorting Paul to Rome. The context of the passage is Paul's journey to Rome as a prisoner, where he would stand trial before Caesar \(Acts 25:11-12; 27:1-44\). 

As a centurion, Julius was a Roman officer in charge of a group of soldiers. The Augustan Cohort was a special unit, possibly associated with the imperial household or the emperor himself. Julius' assignment to escort Paul to Rome indicates the importance of Paul's case and the Roman authorities' interest in ensuring his safe arrival. 

During the journey, Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him to visit his friends and receive care from them when they stopped at Sidon \(Acts 27:3\). This act of kindness suggests that Julius recognized Paul's unique status as a Roman citizen and an important prisoner. 

Throughout the difficult sea voyage, which included a shipwreck on the island of Malta \(Acts 27:41-44\), Julius played a significant role in ensuring Paul's safety and the safety of the other prisoners. His actions demonstrate the respect and fair treatment that Paul received from some Roman officials during his imprisonment and journey to Rome. 

Apart from his role in escorting Paul to Rome, no other details about Julius' life or military career are provided in the Bible.
