Hena was a city in Mesopotamia that the Assyrian kings had conquered shortly before the reign of Sennacherib \(2 Kgs 18:34; 19:13; [[Isa.37.13|Isa.37.13]]\). The exact location of Hena is uncertain, but it may be identified with the ancient town of Ana or Anah, situated about 20 miles from Babylon on the Euphrates River, not far from the city of Sippara \(modern-day Mosaib\). The Assyrian conquest of Hena is mentioned in the context of Sennacherib's boasting about the cities and kingdoms that had fallen to Assyria, challenging Hezekiah's faith in God's ability to protect Jerusalem.
