- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.2.46|Ezr.2.46]]; 
- only referred to as Hagab **<big>[[H2285|חָגָב]]</big>**.

Hagab is mentioned in [[Ezra.2.46|Ezra 2:46]] as one of the temple servants \(Nethinim\) who returned to Jerusalem from Babylonian captivity under the leadership of Zerubbabel. The temple servants were a group of people assigned to assist the Levites in the maintenance and service of the temple. They were not of Israelite descent but were likely descendants of the Gibeonites who had been assigned by Joshua to serve in the tabernacle \(Joshua 9:27\). Hagab and the other temple servants are listed among those who returned to help rebuild the temple and restore worship in Jerusalem.
