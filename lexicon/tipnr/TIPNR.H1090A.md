- A woman living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.29.29|Gen.29.29]]; 
- only referred to as Bilhah **<big>[[H1090|בִּלְהָה]]</big>**; 
- wife of Israel **<big>[[H3478|יִשְׂרָאֵל]]</big>**; 
-  mother of Dan **<big>[[H1835|דָּן]]</big>** and Naphtali **<big>[[H5321|נַפְתָּלִי]]</big>**.

Bilhah was the maidservant of Rachel, wife of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) \(Gen. 29:29\). When Rachel found herself unable to conceive, she gave Bilhah to Jacob as a wife to bear children on her behalf, following the custom of the time \(Gen. 30:3-4\). Bilhah gave birth to two sons, Dan and Naphtali \(Gen. 30:5-8\), who became the ancestors of two of the twelve tribes of Israel. Later, Jacob's firstborn son, Reuben, slept with Bilhah, an act that greatly displeased Jacob \(Gen. 35:22\). Despite this incident, Bilhah is still mentioned among the members of Jacob's family who went to Egypt during the famine \(Gen. 46:25\). Her sons, Dan and Naphtali, are listed among the seventy members of Jacob's household \(Gen. 46:23-25\). Bilhah's story highlights the complex family dynamics in Jacob's household and the importance of childbearing in ancient Israelite society. Her sons' inclusion in the twelve tribes of Israel underscores God's providence in fulfilling His promise to make a great nation from Jacob's descendants.
