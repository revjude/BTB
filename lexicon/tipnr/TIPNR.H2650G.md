Man living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Huppim</span> is mentioned in the genealogy of Manasseh as a descendant of Ir or as a son of Machir.
- A man from the tribe of Benjamin  living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[1Chr.7.12|1Ch.7.12]]; 
- only referred to as Huppim<[[H2650G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ח</span>ֻ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>פ</span>ִּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ים</span>\); 
-  son of Ir<[[H5893G]]>; 
- a brother of Shuppim<[[H8206G]]> and Maacah<[[H4601M]]>.

Huppim is mentioned in [[1Chr.7.12|1 Chronicles 7:12]] and 7:15 as part of the genealogy of the tribe of Manasseh, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. However, there is some ambiguity in the text regarding his exact relationship to the other members of the tribe. 

In [[1Chr.7.12|1 Chronicles 7:12]], Huppim and his brother Shuppim are described as the sons of Ir. However, the verse also mentions that they were the sons of Aher, which could be interpreted as "another" or as a proper name. 

In [[1Chr.7.15|1 Chronicles 7:15]], Huppim is mentioned again, this time in relation to Machir, the son of Manasseh. The verse states that Machir took a wife for Huppim and Shuppim, and that their sister's name was Maakah. 

The exact relationship between Huppim, Shuppim, Ir, Aher, and Machir is not entirely clear from the text. It is possible that Huppim and Shuppim were descendants of Manasseh through Ir or Aher, and that Machir, as the son of Manasseh, arranged their marriages. 

Despite the ambiguity in the genealogical details, the inclusion of Huppim in the record of Manasseh's descendants highlights the importance of family lineage and tribal identity in ancient Israelite society. The genealogies in 1 Chronicles serve to establish the connections between individuals and their ancestral tribes.
