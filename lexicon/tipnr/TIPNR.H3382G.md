He was the son of Mahalalel and the father of Enoch. Jared lived to the age of 962 years, making him the second-longest-lived person mentioned in the Bible after Methuselah. He was born when Mahalalel was 65 years old and had other sons and daughters in addition to Enoch. Jared's life is notable for being the father of Enoch, who is described as walking with God and being taken by God without experiencing death \(Genesis 5:22-24\). In [[Luke.3.37|Luke 3:37]], Jared is also mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus Christ, emphasizing the continuity of God's plan from creation to the coming of the Messiah.
