Hadlai is mentioned in [[2Chr.28.12|2 Chronicles 28:12]] as the father of Amasa, who was one of the leaders of Ephraim during the reign of King Ahaz of Judah. When Pekah, king of Israel, attacked Judah and took captives, some leaders of Ephraim, including Amasa son of Hadlai, opposed this action. They stood against the army of Israel and urged them to release the captives, as they believed that the Lord's fierce anger was already against Israel. The army listened to their plea and released the captives, providing them with clothing, food, and medical care before sending them back to Judah.
