Beth-rehob, also known as Rehob, was an Aramean city and region located in the north of Israel, near the border with Aram \(Syria\). It is mentioned in the context of the Israelites' conquest of Canaan and later during the reign of King David. 

In [[Num.13.21|Numbers 13:21]], the spies sent by Moses to explore Canaan are said to have gone as far north as Rehob, near Lebo-hamath. This suggests that Rehob was located in the northernmost part of the Promised Land, close to the entrance of Hamath, a major city in Syria. 

In [[Judg.18.28|Judges 18:28]], Rehob is mentioned as a reference point to describe the location of Laish, a city that the Danites conquered and renamed Dan. The text states that Laish was situated near Beth-rehob, indicating the proximity of the two places. 

During the reign of King David, Beth-rehob played a role in the conflict between Israel and the Ammonites. In [[2Sam.10.6|2 Samuel 10:6]], the Ammonites, facing an impending attack from David's army, hired Aramean mercenaries from various regions, including Beth-rehob, to help them in battle. The Arameans of Beth-rehob, along with those from Zobah, provided 20,000 foot soldiers to support the Ammonites. 

In the subsequent battle at Helam \([[2Sam.10.8|2 Samuel 10:8]]\), the Arameans of Beth-rehob and Zobah, together with the Ammonites, faced David's army, led by Joab and Abishai. The Israelites defeated the Arameans and Ammonites, and the Arameans made peace with Israel, fearing to help the Ammonites any further. 

The exact location of Beth-rehob is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the region of Aram, north of Israel, possibly in the area known as the Beqaa Valley in modern-day Lebanon. Its association with the Arameans and its proximity to Hamath suggest that it was an important city or region in the Aramean kingdom.
