Bezek was a city mentioned in the Bible as the place where the tribe of Judah fought against the Canaanites and Perizzites \([[Judg.1.4|Judges 1:4]]-5\). The battle occurred after the death of Joshua when the tribes of Israel were conquering and dividing the land of Canaan. Judah, accompanied by the tribe of Simeon, defeated ten thousand Canaanite and Perizzite soldiers at Bezek. They captured Adoni-bezek, the ruler of the city, and cut off his thumbs and big toes as punishment for his cruelty to seventy other kings. The exact location of Bezek is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the central or southern part of Canaan, within the territory of Judah.
