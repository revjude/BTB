Attai is mentioned in 2 Chronicles 11 as one of the sons of King Rehoboam of Judah and his wife Maacah, the daughter of Absalom. Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, became king after the division of the kingdom into Judah and Israel. He had many wives and concubines, and Maacah was his favorite wife. Attai is listed among the sons born to Rehoboam and Maacah, along with Abijah, who would later succeed Rehoboam as king of Judah. As a prince in the royal line of Judah, Attai would have held a position of importance and influence within the kingdom.
