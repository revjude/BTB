Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Bigthan</span>, a doorkeeper in Ahasuerus' court, plotted to assassinate the king but was exposed by Mordecai.
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Esth.2.21|Est.2.21]]; 
- referred to as Bigthan or Bigthana **<big>[[H0904|בִּגְתָן]]</big>**.

Bigthan, along with Teresh, was one of the doorkeepers in the court of King Ahasuerus \(Est. 2:21\). They became angry with the king and conspired to assassinate him. However, their plot was discovered by Mordecai, the cousin and guardian of Esther, who had been recently crowned as queen. Mordecai informed Esther about the plot, and she reported it to the king in Mordecai's name \(Est. 2:22\). After an investigation, Bigthan and Teresh were found guilty and hanged on the gallows \(Est. 2:23\). The incident was recorded in the king's presence in the book of the chronicles. Later, when the king was unable to sleep, he ordered the book of chronicles to be read to him, and Mordecai's good deed in exposing the plot was brought to his attention \(Est. 6:1-2\). This event led to Mordecai's elevation and honor, as well as the king's protection of the Jewish people from Haman's evil scheme. The story of Bigthan's plot and its consequences demonstrates the importance of loyalty, vigilance, and divine providence in the narrative of Esther.
