Uzal is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Ezek.27.19|Ezekiel 27:19]], as part of a prophecy against Tyre. In this passage, Ezekiel lists various nations and regions that traded with Tyre, including Dan, Javan, and Uzal. The verse states that these places traded "wrought iron, cassia, and calamus" in Tyre's marketplace. The exact location of Uzal is uncertain, but some scholars believe it may refer to a region in Arabia, possibly associated with the ancient city of Sanaa in modern-day Yemen. Other interpretations suggest that Uzal could be a reference to a type of high-quality sword or blade, rather than a geographical location. The mention of Uzal in Ezekiel's prophecy highlights the extensive trade network of Tyre and the various commodities exchanged in the ancient Near East.
