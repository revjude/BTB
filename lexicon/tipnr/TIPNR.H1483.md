Gur is a place mentioned briefly in the account of the death of Ahaziah, king of Judah. After Jehu had killed Joram, king of Israel, Ahaziah fled by the way of the garden house. Jehu pursued Ahaziah and ordered his men to shoot him in his chariot at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam \([[2Kgs.9.27|2 Kings 9:27]]\). Ahaziah was wounded there and managed to escape to Megiddo, where he died. The exact location of Gur is not specified in the Bible, but it is described as being near Ibleam, a town in the territory of Manasseh, near the border with Issachar. Apart from this single reference in the context of Ahaziah's death, no further information about Gur is provided in the Bible. Its mention serves to locate the place where Ahaziah was mortally wounded during Jehu's coup against the house of Ahab.
