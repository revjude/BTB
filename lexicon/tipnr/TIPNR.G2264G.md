Herod, also known as Herod the Great, was the Roman-appointed king of Judea during the time of Jesus' birth. He was an Idumean \(Edomite\) by birth and was appointed as king by the Roman Senate in 40 BC. Herod was known for his ambitious building projects, including the expansion and renovation of the Second Temple in Jerusalem. In the Bible, Herod is portrayed as a cruel and paranoid ruler. When the wise men from the East inquired about the birth of the "king of the Jews," Herod saw this as a threat to his power \([[Matt.2.1|Mat.2.1]]-8\). After the wise men failed to report back to him, Herod ordered the massacre of all male children aged two and under in Bethlehem and the surrounding region \([[Matt.2.1|Mat.2.1]]6-18\). This event, known as the "Massacre of the Innocents," reflects Herod's ruthless nature and his determination to eliminate any perceived threats to his rule. Herod's death is mentioned in [[Matt.2.1|Matthew 2:1]]9, which allowed Joseph, Mary, and Jesus to return from Egypt, where they had fled to escape Herod's wrath. \(Mat.2; [[Luke.1.5|Luk.1.5]]\).
