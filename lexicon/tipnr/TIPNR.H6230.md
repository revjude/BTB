Esek is the name of a well mentioned in [[Gen.26.20|Genesis 26:20]], which was dug by the servants of Isaac, the son of Abraham. The well was located in the Gerar Valley, where Isaac had settled after the Philistines had stopped up the wells previously dug by his father. 

When Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found a well of fresh water, the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with them, claiming the water as their own. As a result, Isaac named the well Esek, which means "contention" or "dispute," reflecting the conflict that had arisen over the water rights. 

The incident at Esek demonstrates the ongoing tensions between Isaac and the local inhabitants, as well as the importance of water sources in the semi-arid region. It also highlights Isaac's peaceful nature, as he chose to move on and dig another well rather than engage in further confrontation with the herdsmen of Gerar.
