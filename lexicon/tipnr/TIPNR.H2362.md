Hauran was a region situated east of the Sea of Galilee, known for its fertile lands. The prophet Ezekiel, in his vision of the restored land of Israel, described Hauran as part of the eastern border, between the territories of Damascus and Gilead \(Ezek 47:16,18\). This area was known for its rich basaltic soil, which supported productive agriculture. In the Hellenistic and Roman periods, Hauran was part of the Decapolis and later the province of Arabia Petraea. Today, Hauran is a region primarily located in southwestern Syria and parts of northern Jordan.
