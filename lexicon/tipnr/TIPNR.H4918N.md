Meshullam is mentioned in the book of 2 Chronicles as one of the Levites who supervised the repairs of the temple during the reign of King Josiah \([[2Chr.34.12|2Ch.34.12]]\). He is described as a Kohathite, indicating his descent from Kohath, one of the sons of Levi. Meshullam, along with Jahath and Obadiah, who were also Levites, oversaw the workmen and all those doing the work in the various kinds of service. This event took place during Josiah's reforms, which included the restoration of the temple and the renewal of the covenant with God.
