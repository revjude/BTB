Ephod, the son of Hanniel, is mentioned in the book of Numbers as the appointed leader from the tribe of Manasseh who assisted in dividing the land of Canaan among the Israelite tribes \([[Num.34.23|Num.34.23]]\). After the Israelites had conquered the land of Canaan under the leadership of Joshua, representatives from each tribe were chosen to help allocate the land according to the instructions given by God. Ephod was selected as the representative for the tribe of Manasseh, highlighting his leadership skills and the trust placed in him by his tribe. The division of the land was a crucial task, ensuring that each tribe received its allotted portion and that the distribution was fair and equitable. Ephod's role in this process demonstrates his importance and the responsibility he held within his tribe. No further details are provided about Ephod's life, his family, or his other contributions to the tribe of Manasseh. His mention in this context serves to highlight the organization and cooperation among the tribes during the allocation of the Promised Land and to recognize the significant individuals who played a role in this important event in Israel's history.
