Machir, the son of Ammiel, was a resident of Lo-debar who played a significant role in the life of Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan \([[2Sam.9.4|2Sa.9.4]],5\). After the deaths of Saul and Jonathan, Mephibosheth was taken to the house of Machir in Lo-debar, where he found refuge and support. When King David sought to show kindness to the remaining descendants of Saul, he learned that Mephibosheth was living in the house of Machir \([[2Sam.9.4|2Sa.9.4]]\). David summoned Mephibosheth and restored to him all the land that had belonged to Saul, ensuring his well-being \(2Sa.9.7-13\). Later, during Absalom's rebellion against David, Machir, along with Shobi and Barzillai, provided essential supplies to David and his followers, including beds, basins, wheat, barley, flour, and other provisions \([[2Sam.17.27|2Sa.17.27]]-29\). Machir's actions demonstrate his loyalty and support for both Mephibosheth and King David during challenging times.
