- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[Jer.1.1|Jer.1.1]]; 
- only referred to as Hilkiah **<big>[[H2518|חִלְקִיָּה]]</big>**;

Hilkiah is mentioned in [[Jer.1.1|Jeremiah 1:1]] as the father of the prophet Jeremiah. He is described as one of the priests living in Anathoth, a city in the territory of Benjamin, just a few miles northeast of Jerusalem. 

As a priest, Hilkiah would have served in the temple and been responsible for teaching the Law and conducting religious ceremonies. The fact that Jeremiah, his son, was called to be a prophet suggests that Hilkiah may have been a devout and faithful priest who raised his children in the knowledge and service of God. 

Although little is known about Hilkiah beyond this brief mention, his role as the father of one of the most prominent prophets in the Old Testament is significant. Jeremiah's ministry spanned several decades, from the reign of King Josiah through the Babylonian exile, and his prophecies and teachings played a crucial role in the spiritual history of Israel. Hilkiah's influence as a priest and father undoubtedly shaped Jeremiah's early life and prepared him for his prophetic calling.
