Mamre was a location near Hebron in Canaan, closely associated with the life of Abraham. It was at Mamre that Abraham pitched his tent and built an altar to the Lord \([[Gen.13.18|Genesis 13:18]]\). Abraham's allies, Mamre, Eshcol, and Aner, lived in this area \([[Gen.14.13|Genesis 14:13]], 24\). The Lord appeared to Abraham at Mamre, accompanied by three men, and promised that Sarah would bear a son \([[Gen.18.1|Genesis 18:1]]-15\). The cave of Machpelah, which Abraham purchased as a burial site for his family, was located in the field of Ephron the Hittite, near Mamre \([[Gen.23.17|Genesis 23:17]]-19; 25:9; 49:30; 50:13\). Abraham, Isaac, and Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) all lived at Mamre \([[Gen.35.27|Genesis 35:27]]\).
