Bethesda, also known as Bethzatha, was a pool located in Jerusalem, mentioned in the Gospel of John. The name Bethesda is derived from the Hebrew term meaning "house of mercy" or "house of grace," while Bethzatha comes from the Aramaic, meaning "house of olives" or "house of the olive tree." 

The pool is described as having five roofed colonnades or porticoes, suggesting a structure with covered walkways surrounding the pool. It was located near the Sheep Gate, which was likely a gate in the northern wall of the city, used for bringing sheep into Jerusalem for sacrificial purposes. 

In John 5:1-15, Jesus visits the Pool of Bethesda and encounters a man who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. The man explains that he has been unable to enter the pool when the water is stirred up, as someone else always steps in before him. It was believed that an angel would periodically come down and stir up the water, and the first person to enter the pool after this would be healed of their infirmities. 

Jesus, seeing the man and knowing his long-standing condition, asks him, "Do you want to get well?" The man responds by explaining his inability to enter the pool first. Jesus then commands him, "Get up! Pick up your mat and walk." Instantly, the man is healed, takes up his mat, and starts walking. 

This miracle leads to a controversy, as it occurred on the Sabbath, and the Jewish leaders considered carrying a mat on the Sabbath to be a violation of the law. Jesus later finds the man in the temple and advises him to stop sinning, lest something worse happens to him. 

The Pool of Bethesda is an example of Jesus' power to heal and his authority over the Sabbath. It also highlights the contrast between the man's long-standing infirmity and the instantaneous nature of Jesus' healing. 

Archaeologists have uncovered a site near the Church of St. Anne in Jerusalem, which is believed to be the location of the Pool of Bethesda. The excavations revealed a pool with multiple porticoes, consistent with the biblical description.
