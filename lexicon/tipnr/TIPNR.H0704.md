<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Arba</span> was the father of Anak and the namesake of Kiriath-arba, which was the former name of Hebron.
- A man living before Israel's Monarchy, first mentioned at [[Josh.14.15|Jos.14.15]]; 
- only referred to as Arba **<big>[[H0704|אַרְבַּע]]</big>**; 
- father of Anak **<big>[[H6061|עָנָק]]</big>**.

Arba is mentioned in the book of Joshua as the father of Anak and the namesake of Kiriath-arba, which was the former name of the city of Hebron. Hebron was a significant city in the hill country of Judah, later assigned to Caleb as part of his inheritance. The text states that Hebron's former name was Kiriath-arba, which means "the city of Arba." Arba is described as the greatest man among the Anakim, a group of people known for their large stature and strength. The Anakim were descendants of Anak and were considered a formidable enemy by the Israelites during their conquest of Canaan. The renaming of the city from Kiriath-arba to Hebron marks a significant shift in the region's history as the Israelites claimed the land promised to them by God. Apart from this mention in Joshua, no further information is provided about Arba himself in the biblical text.
