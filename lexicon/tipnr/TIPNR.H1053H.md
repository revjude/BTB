Beth-shemesh, meaning "house of the sun" in Hebrew, is mentioned in [[Josh.19.22|Joshua 19:22]] as a border town in the territory allotted to the tribe of Issachar. This Beth-shemesh is distinct from the more well-known city of the same name in Judah. 

The town is listed along with other cities and towns in Issachar's inheritance, such as Tabor, Shahazimah, and En-gannim. Its inclusion in this list suggests that it was located on the border of Issachar's territory, possibly adjacent to the territories of other tribes. 

No other information about this Beth-shemesh is provided in the Bible, and it is not mentioned in any other historical or archaeological context. Its name, "house of the sun," may refer to the presence of a shrine or temple dedicated to the sun god, or it could be related to a local geographical feature. 

The exact location of Beth-shemesh in Issachar is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the region of the Jezreel Valley, which was known for its fertile land and strategic importance.
