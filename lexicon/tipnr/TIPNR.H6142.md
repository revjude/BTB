Ikkesh the Tekoite is mentioned in the Bible as the father of Ira, one of King David's mighty warriors. Ira is listed among the "thirty" mighty men who were renowned for their military prowess and bravery \([[2Sam.23.26|2 Samuel 23:26]]; [[1Chr.11.28|1 Chronicles 11:28]]\). 

The "mighty men" or "mighty warriors" were an elite group of soldiers who served under King David and played a significant role in his military campaigns and the establishment of his kingdom. They were known for their exceptional combat skills and unwavering loyalty to the king. 

Ikkesh is specifically identified as a Tekoite, indicating that he was from the town of Tekoa, located in the territory of Judah, south of Jerusalem. The mention of Ikkesh's place of origin suggests that his son Ira may have also been from Tekoa. 

In addition to being listed among the mighty warriors, Ira the son of Ikkesh is also mentioned in [[1Chr.27.9|1 Chronicles 27:9]] as one of the twelve military commanders who served King David. Each of these commanders was responsible for leading a division of 24,000 men, with each division serving the king for one month out of the year. 

Although no specific details are provided about Ikkesh himself, his son Ira's inclusion among David's mighty warriors and military commanders indicates that the family was known for their military skill and leadership. Ikkesh's mention as Ira's father also highlights the importance of family lineage and the passing down of military traditions from one generation to another.
