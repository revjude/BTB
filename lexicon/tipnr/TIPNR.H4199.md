Mizzah is mentioned in [[Gen.36.13|Genesis 36:13]],17 and [[1Chr.1.37|1 Chronicles 1:37]] as one of the grandsons of Esau and a chief of Edom. He was the son of Reuel, who was one of Esau's sons by his wife Basemath. 

The genealogies in these passages list the descendants of Esau, who was also known as Edom, and provide insight into the family structure and leadership of the Edomite people. Mizzah is named among the chiefs of Edom, indicating that he held a position of authority and influence within the tribe. 

As a grandson of Esau, Mizzah was part of the second generation of Edomites and likely played a role in the establishment and growth of the Edomite kingdom. The Edomites were closely related to the Israelites, as Esau was the twin brother of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) \(Israel\), but they often had a contentious relationship throughout their history. 

Apart from being listed in these genealogies, no further details are provided about Mizzah's life, achievements, or specific role as a chief of Edom. However, his inclusion in these records highlights the importance of family lineage and tribal leadership in the ancient Near East.
