<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Shechem</span>, founder of a Hivite city where Jacob's daughter Dinah was raped.
- A man living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.33.19|Gen.33.19]]; 
- only referred to as Shechem **<big>[[H7927|שְׁכֶם]]</big>**; 
- a son of Hamor **<big>[[H2544|חֲמוֹר]]</big>**.

Shechem was the founder of a city of the same name located in Canaan, inhabited by the Hivites. Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) camped near Shechem upon returning to Canaan and bought a piece of land there \([[Gen.33.19|Genesis 33:19]]\). 

In Genesis 34, Shechem is the setting of a tragic incident. Shechem, the son of the city's ruler Hamor, raped Jacob's daughter Dinah. Shechem wanted to marry Dinah, so Hamor proposed intermarriage between their people and Jacob's family. Jacob's sons deceitfully agreed on the condition that the men of Shechem be circumcised. While the men were recovering, Simeon and Levi attacked the city, killing all the males and plundering it. Jacob rebuked them for this, fearing retaliation from the Canaanites.
