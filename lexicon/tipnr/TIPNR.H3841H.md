Libnah was a Canaanite city that was conquered by Joshua during the Israelite conquest of the Promised Land \(Joshua 10:29-32, 39; 12:15\). It was located in the Shephelah region of Judah \([[Josh.15.42|Joshua 15:42]]\). Libnah was later designated as a Levitical city, given to the descendants of Aaron \([[Josh.21.13|Joshua 21:13]]; [[1Chr.6.57|1 Chronicles 6:57]]\). During the reign of King Joram of Judah, Libnah revolted against Judah's rule \([[2Kgs.8.22|2 Kings 8:22]]; [[2Chr.21.10|2 Chronicles 21:10]]\). The city is also mentioned in the context of King Hezekiah's reign, as the place where the Assyrian commander Rabshakeh returned after speaking with Hezekiah's officials \([[2Kgs.19.8|2 Kings 19:8]]; [[Isa.37.8|Isaiah 37:8]]\). Libnah was the hometown of Hamutal, the mother of King Jehoahaz and King Zedekiah of Judah \([[2Kgs.23.31|2 Kings 23:31]]; 24:18; [[Jer.52.1|Jeremiah 52:1]]\).
