Irijah was a captain of the guard who arrested the prophet Jeremiah at the Benjamin Gate in Jerusalem, as recorded in [[Jer.37.13|Jeremiah 37:13]]-14. When Jeremiah attempted to go to the territory of Benjamin during a lull in the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem, Irijah seized him and accused him of deserting to the Babylonians. Jeremiah denied the charge, but Irijah still brought him to the officials, who beat Jeremiah and imprisoned him. Irijah's name means "Yahweh sees" in Hebrew. His action reflects the tense and suspicious atmosphere in Jerusalem during the Babylonian invasion.
