The Salt Valley, also known as the Valley of Salt, is a location mentioned in the Bible where David and his commanders achieved significant military victories. In [[2Sam.8.13|2 Samuel 8:13]] and [[1Chr.18.12|1 Chronicles 18:12]], it is recorded that David's commander Abishai defeated 18,000 Edomites in the Salt Valley. Later, in [[2Kgs.14.7|2 Kings 14:7]] and [[2Chr.25.11|2 Chronicles 25:11]], King Amaziah of Judah is said to have killed 10,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. The exact location of the Salt Valley is uncertain, but it was likely situated near the Dead Sea, possibly in the Arabah region south of the Dead Sea. The valley's name suggests an area with high salt content, which is characteristic of the Dead Sea region. Psalm 60, which is attributed to David, also mentions the Salt Valley in the context of military victories \(Psa. 60:1\). These biblical accounts highlight the Salt Valley as a place of significant military confrontations between Israel and its neighbors, particularly the Edomites.
