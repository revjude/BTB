Zanoah was a town located in the Judean lowlands \(Shephelah\) that was allotted to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land \(Josh. 15:34\). It is mentioned in the genealogy of Judah, where it is associated with Jekuthiel, the father of Zanoah \(1 Chr. 4:18\). During the time of Nehemiah, the people of Zanoah played a significant role in rebuilding the Valley Gate and a section of the wall of Jerusalem \(Neh. 3:13\). They are also listed among the towns resettled by the people of Judah after the Babylonian exile \(Neh. 11:30\). The exact location of Zanoah is not specified in the Bible, but it was situated in the Shephelah region, known for its fertile valleys and strategic importance. The repeated mention of Zanoah in various contexts throughout the Bible highlights its significance as a town within the territory of Judah.
