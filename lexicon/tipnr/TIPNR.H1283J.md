Beriah was a Levite who lived during the reign of King David \(1 Ch. 23:10-11\). He was a descendant of Shimei, one of the sons of Levi. Beriah had few sons, so his family was combined with that of his brother Jeush to form a single father's house for the purpose of temple service. This arrangement was made when David organized the Levites for their duties in the tabernacle and the future temple. The mention of Beriah and his family in this context highlights the importance of the Levites' role in maintaining worship and religious practices in ancient Israel.
