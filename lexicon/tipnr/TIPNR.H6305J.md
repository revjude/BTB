Pedaiah was the father of a man who helped repair the wall of Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah, according to [[Neh.3.25|Nehemiah 3:25]]. The text mentions "the house of Pedaiah son of Parosh" as a reference point for the section of wall being repaired by Pedaiah's unnamed son. This suggests that Pedaiah's family had a significant presence in Jerusalem and may have been involved in the restoration efforts.
