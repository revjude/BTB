<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Pedaiah</span>, father of a man who made repairs to the wall of Jerusalem in Nehemiah's time.
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.3.25|Neh.3.25]]; 
- only referred to as Pedaiah **<big>[[H6305|פְּדָיָה]]</big>**; 
- a son of Parosh **<big>[[H6551|פַּרְעֹשׁ]]</big>**.

Pedaiah was the father of a man who helped repair the wall of Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah, according to [[Neh.3.25|Nehemiah 3:25]]. The text mentions "the house of Pedaiah son of Parosh" as a reference point for the section of wall being repaired by Pedaiah's unnamed son. This suggests that Pedaiah's family had a significant presence in Jerusalem and may have been involved in the restoration efforts.
