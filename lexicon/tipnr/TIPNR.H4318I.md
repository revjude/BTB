Micah is briefly mentioned in the genealogy of the tribe of Reuben in the book of 1 Chronicles \([[1Chr.5.5|1Ch.5.5]]\). He is listed as a descendant of Joel, who was one of the sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\). The genealogy in this passage traces the lineage of the Reubenites, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, who settled east of the Jordan River. No additional information is provided about Micah's life, occupation, or role within the Reubenite clan. His mention serves to maintain a record of the generations descending from Reuben.
