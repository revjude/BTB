Golgotha, which means "Place of a Skull" in Aramaic, was the location outside the walls of Jerusalem where Jesus Christ was crucified. All four Gospels mention Golgotha as the site of the crucifixion \(Matthew 27:33; Mark 15:22; [[Luke.23.33|Luke 23:33]]; [[John.19.17|John 19:17]]\). The exact reason for the name is not specified in the Bible, but it may refer to the physical appearance of the site, resembling a skull, or it could be associated with a place of execution. The Gospel accounts describe how Jesus, after being sentenced to death by Pontius Pilate, was led to Golgotha, where he was crucified along with two criminals. The location of Golgotha was outside the city walls, as was customary for executions in ancient times. It is also mentioned that the site was near a garden and a tomb, which belonged to Joseph of Arimathea, where Jesus' body was later laid \(John 19:41-42\). The crucifixion at Golgotha is the central event in the Christian faith, as it represents Jesus' sacrificial death for the sins of humanity, leading to his resurrection and the offer of salvation to all who believe in him.
