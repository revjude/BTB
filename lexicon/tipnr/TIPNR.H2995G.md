Jabneel, also known as Jabneh, was a town located on the northwestern border of the tribe of Judah, near the Mediterranean Sea \([[Josh.15.11|Joshua 15:11]]\). During the reign of King Uzziah of Judah, the town was fortified as part of his military campaigns against the Philistines \([[2Chr.26.6|2 Chronicles 26:6]]\). The city later became known as Jamnia and served as a center of Jewish learning and the seat of the Sanhedrin after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD. Today, it is known as Yavne, a city in central Israel.
