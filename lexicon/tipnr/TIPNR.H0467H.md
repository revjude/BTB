Eliphelet, the son of Ahasbai the Maacathite, is mentioned in the list of David's mighty men \([[2Sam.23.34|2Sa.23.34]]\). The mighty men were a group of elite warriors who fought alongside King David and were known for their exceptional bravery, strength, and military prowess. Eliphelet's inclusion in this list indicates that he was a skilled warrior who played a significant role in David's military campaigns. His father, Ahasbai, is described as a Maacathite, suggesting that Eliphelet may have had ties to the region of Maacah, located near the border of Israel and Syria.
