Omri was the sixth king of Israel, who reigned for 12 years \([[1Kgs.16.23|1 Kings 16:23]]\). He came to power after a period of political instability and established Samaria as the new capital of Israel \(1 Kings 16:24\). Omri was a powerful ruler who expanded Israel's territory and made alliances with neighboring kingdoms, including Phoenicia through the marriage of his son Ahab to Jezebel \(1 Kings 16:31\). However, Omri did evil in the eyes of the Lord and followed the sins of Jeroboam \([[1Kgs.16.25|1 Kings 16:25]]-26\). The dynasty he founded, known as the "house of Omri," became notorious for its wickedness, particularly during the reign of his son Ahab \([[1Kgs.16.30|1 Kings 16:30]]; [[Mic.6.16|Micah 6:16]]\). Omri's reign was significant in the history of Israel, as he strengthened the kingdom politically and economically, but also led the nation further into idolatry and disobedience to God.
