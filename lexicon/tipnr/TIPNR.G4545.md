Samuel was a prophet and the last judge of Israel before the establishment of the monarchy. He was born to Hannah, who had been barren, and dedicated to the Lord's service from birth \(1 Samuel 1:11, 20\). Samuel grew up in the tabernacle under the guidance of Eli the priest \([[1Sam.2.18|1 Samuel 2:18]], 21, 26\). God called Samuel while he was still a boy, and he became a prophet \(1 Samuel 3\). Samuel played a crucial role in Israel's transition from the period of the judges to the monarchy. He led Israel in a decisive victory over the Philistines at Mizpah \([[1Sam.7.5|1 Samuel 7:5]]-14\) and served as a judge over Israel \([[1Sam.7.15|1 Samuel 7:15]]-17\). When the people demanded a king, Samuel anointed Saul as the first king of Israel \(1 Samuel 8-10\). However, when Saul disobeyed God, Samuel announced that God had rejected him as king \(1 Samuel 15\). Samuel then anointed David as the next king \([[1Sam.16.1|1 Samuel 16:1]]-13\). Samuel continued to guide and counsel David, even when Saul pursued him \(1 Samuel 19:18\). After Samuel's death, he was buried in Ramah \([[1Sam.25.1|1 Samuel 25:1]]; 28:3\). He is remembered as a faithful prophet and judge who played a pivotal role in Israel's history \(Psalm 99:6; [[Jer.15.1|Jeremiah 15:1]]; Acts 3:24; 13:20; [[Heb.11.32|Hebrews 11:32]]\). 

In [[1Chr.6.33|1 Chronicles 6:33]] he is listed in the genealogy of the Levites, specifically in the line of Kohath, which was one of the three main divisions of the Levites \(1 Chronicles 6:1, 33\). This Samuel is an ancestor of Heman, who was one of the chief musicians appointed by David to lead worship in the tabernacle \(1 Chronicles 6:31-33\). It is important to note that this Samuel is not the same person as the prophet and judge Samuel, who was also the son of an Elkanah \([[1Sam.1.20|1 Samuel 1:20]]\). The Samuel mentioned in [[1Chr.6.33|1 Chronicles 6:33]] lived much earlier than the prophet Samuel and was part of the Levitical line that served in the tabernacle and temple worship.
