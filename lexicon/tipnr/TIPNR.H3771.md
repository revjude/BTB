- A prince of Persia living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Esth.1.14|Est.1.14]]; 
- only referred to as Carshena **<big>[[H3771|כַּרְשְׁנָא]]</big>**.

Carshena was one of the seven princes of Persia and Media who served in the court of King Ahasuerus, also known as Xerxes \([[Esth.1.14|Esther 1:14]]\). These princes were the closest advisors to the king and had the privilege of direct access to his presence. They were known for their knowledge of the law and their understanding of the times. When Queen Vashti refused to appear before the king during a royal feast, Ahasuerus consulted with his wise men, including Carshena, to determine the appropriate response according to the law \(Esther 1:15\). The inclusion of Carshena among the named princes highlights his high status and influence within the Persian court during the events described in the book of Esther.
