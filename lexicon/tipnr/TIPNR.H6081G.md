Epher is mentioned in the genealogy of Abraham as one of the sons of Midian, who was born to Abraham through his wife Keturah \([[Gen.25.4|Gen.25.4]]; [[1Chr.1.33|1Ch.1.33]]\). Epher is listed among the descendants of Abraham, highlighting the diverse lineage that emerged from the patriarch. The sons of Midian, including Epher, are mentioned after Abraham had sent them away to the east with gifts, separating them from his son Isaac \(Gen.25.6\). This suggests that Epher and his brothers settled in the region east of Canaan. The genealogy in Chronicles repeats the information from Genesis, confirming Epher's place in the family line \([[1Chr.1.33|1Ch.1.33]]\). No further details are provided about Epher's life, his specific role, or the people group that may have descended from him. His mention in the genealogies serves to demonstrate the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that he would be the father of many nations and to provide a record of the various branches of Abraham's descendants.
