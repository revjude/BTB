Maaseiah was an Israelite who was found to have married a foreign woman during the time of Ezra \([[Ezra.10.30|Ezr.10.30]]\). He is listed among the descendants of Pahath-Moab who had taken foreign wives \([[Ezra.10.30|Ezr.10.30]]\). During the religious reform led by Ezra, which addressed the issue of intermarriage with foreign women, those who had married foreign women were required to separate from their wives and children \(Ezr.10.44\). This event highlights the importance of maintaining religious and ethnic purity within the Jewish community during the post-exilic period. The inclusion of Maaseiah and others in the list of those who had married foreign women demonstrates the widespread nature of the problem and the need for repentance and restoration.
