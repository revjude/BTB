Zaccur, the son of Imri, is mentioned in the account of the rebuilding of Jerusalem's wall under Nehemiah's leadership. He is listed among the people who worked on repairing the wall after the Babylonian exile. Zaccur and the men of Jericho built the section next to the portion completed by the high priest Eliashib and his fellow priests.
