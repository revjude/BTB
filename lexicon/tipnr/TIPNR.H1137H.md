Bani is briefly mentioned in [[1Chr.6.46|1 Chronicles 6:46]] as a Levite who served as a musician during the reign of King David. The context of the passage is a genealogy of the Levites, specifically the family of Merari, one of the three main Levitical clans. Bani is listed as the son of Shemer \(or 'Shamer'\) and the father of Amzi. The Levites were responsible for assisting the priests in the tabernacle and temple worship, and many of them were appointed as musicians \(1 Chronicles 15:16-24\). Bani's inclusion in this genealogy suggests that he was part of a family line that served in this musical role.
