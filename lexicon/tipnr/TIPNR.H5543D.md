Sallu is mentioned in [[1Chr.9.7|1 Chronicles 9:7]] as one of the Benjamites who lived in Jerusalem. The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 9 lists the inhabitants of Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile, focusing on the priests, Levites, and other Israelites who settled in the city \(1 Chronicles 9:1-3\). Sallu is described as the son of Meshullam, the son of Hodaviah, the son of Hassenuah, indicating his lineage within the tribe of Benjamin. No further details are provided about Sallu's specific role or contributions to the community in Jerusalem. The presence of Benjamites like Sallu in Jerusalem after the exile highlights the importance of the city as a center of Jewish life and worship, and the participation of various tribes in its restoration.
