Ramah is mentioned in the Bible as one of the fortified cities in the territory allocated to the tribe of Naphtali during the division of the Promised Land \(Josh. 19:36\). It is listed among the other cities and towns that were assigned to Naphtali as part of their inheritance. The exact location of this Ramah is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the northern region of Canaan, in the area later known as Galilee. The description of Ramah as a fortified city suggests that it had some strategic or defensive importance, possibly due to its location or the presence of military installations. The mention of Ramah in the list of Naphtali's cities highlights the allocation of specific territories to each of the twelve tribes of Israel, fulfilling God's promise to give them the land of Canaan as an inheritance. Although no further details about this Ramah are provided in the Bible, its inclusion in the biblical record serves to emphasize the orderly division of the land and the establishment of the tribes in their designated areas.
