- David's wife living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Sam.25.3|1Sa.25.3]]; 
- only referred to as Abigail **<big>[[H0026|אֲבִיגַיִל]]</big>**; 
- wife of David **<big>[[H1732|דָּוִד]]</big>** and Nabal **<big>[[H5037|נָבָל]]</big>**; 
-  mother of Chileab **<big>[[H3609|כִּלְאָב]]</big>**.

Abigail was a wise and beautiful woman who was initially married to a wealthy but foolish man named Nabal. When David and his men were in the wilderness, Nabal refused to provide them with food and supplies. Abigail, learning of this, quickly gathered provisions and went to meet David, apologizing for her husband's behavior and urging David not to seek revenge. 

Impressed by her wisdom and courage, David accepted her appeal and spared Nabal's life. When Abigail told Nabal about this incident, he had a heart attack and died ten days later. After Nabal's death, David sent for Abigail and married her. 

Abigail became one of David's wives and bore him a son named Chileab, who is also known as Daniel \([[2Sam.3.3|2 Samuel 3:3]]; [[1Chr.3.1|1 Chronicles 3:1]]\). She accompanied David during his time in Ziklag, where he sought refuge from King Saul \([[1Sam.27.3|1 Samuel 27:3]]; 30:5\). Abigail's story demonstrates her wisdom, diplomacy, and faith in God.
