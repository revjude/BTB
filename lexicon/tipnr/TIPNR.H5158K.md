The Brook of the Arabah is mentioned in the Bible as the eastern boundary of the kingdom of Israel during the reign of Jeroboam II \(Amos 6:14\). Jeroboam II was a powerful king who expanded Israel's territory and restored its borders to their former extent. The Brook of the Arabah likely refers to the Wadi Zered, a seasonal stream that flows into the Dead Sea from the east, marking the boundary between Moab and Edom. 

Amos's prophecy indicates that God would judge Israel for their sins, and their territory would be invaded from the Brook of the Arabah to the entrance of Hamath in the north. This prophecy highlights the extent of Israel's kingdom under Jeroboam II and the impending judgment that would befall them. The Brook of the Arabah serves as a geographical marker, emphasizing the scope of both Israel's power and their coming downfall.
