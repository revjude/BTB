Samothrace is a Greek island located in the northern Aegean Sea, south of the ancient city of Neapolis \(modern-day Kavala\) and west of the region of Thrace. In the Bible, Samothrace is mentioned once, in the context of Paul's second missionary journey. Acts 16:11 records that Paul and his companions, after leaving Troas, sailed directly to Samothrace and then on to Neapolis the following day. Samothrace was known in ancient times for its religious significance, particularly the mystery cult of the Cabeiri, which attracted initiates from across the Greek world. The island was also an important stopping point for ships navigating the northern Aegean Sea. Paul's voyage to Samothrace demonstrates the island's role as a transit point in the region and provides insight into the route of his missionary travels.
