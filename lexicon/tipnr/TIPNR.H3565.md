Bor-ashan is mentioned in [[1Sam.30.30|1 Samuel 30:30]] as one of the towns in southern Judah where David sent a portion of the spoils from his victory over the Amalekites. After rescuing his men's families and recovering the plunder the Amalekites had taken, David shared the spoils with the elders of Judah and various towns, including Bor-ashan. This gesture helped to strengthen David's relationship with the people of Judah during his time of exile from King Saul.
