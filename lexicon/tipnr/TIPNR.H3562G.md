Conaniah was a Levite who served during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. He was appointed as one of the officials in charge of the contributions, tithes, and dedicated gifts brought to the Temple \([[2Chr.31.12|2 Chronicles 31:12]]\). Along with his brother Shimei and other Levites, Conaniah was responsible for ensuring the proper distribution of these offerings to the priests and Levites \([[2Chr.31.13|2 Chronicles 31:13]]\). 

Later, during the Passover celebration in Hezekiah's reign, Conaniah, along with other Levite leaders, contributed a large number of animals for the Passover sacrifices \([[2Chr.35.9|2 Chronicles 35:9]]\). This demonstrates Conaniah's ongoing commitment to the Temple service and his leadership role among the Levites.
