Joseph is mentioned in [[Neh.12.14|Nehemiah 12:14]] as the head of the priestly family of Shebaniah during the days of Joiakim, the high priest. This was during the post-exilic period in Jerusalem, likely in the 5th century BC. The priests were organized into divisions or families, each with a designated leader. Nehemiah 12 lists the heads of priestly families in the generation following the return from Babylonian exile under Jeshua \(Nehemiah 12:1-7\) and then during the time of Joiakim \(Nehemiah 12:12-21\).
