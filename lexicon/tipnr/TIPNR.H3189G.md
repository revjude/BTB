Jahath is mentioned in 1 Chronicles 4:2 as part of the genealogy of the tribe of Judah. He is identified as the son of Reaiah, who was a descendant of Judah through Shobal. 

The genealogy in this chapter traces the descendants of Judah, one of the twelve sons of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\). It provides a detailed record of the families and clans within the tribe of Judah, highlighting significant individuals and their relationships. 

Jahath's father, Reaiah, is listed as the son of Shobal \(1Ch.4.2\). Shobal was one of the sons of Hur, who was the firstborn of Ephrathah, the wife of Caleb son of Hezron \(1Ch.2.19,50\). This places Jahath within the larger context of the Hurite clan within the tribe of Judah. 

Apart from his immediate family connections, no other specific details are provided about Jahath's life, occupation, or role within the tribe. His inclusion in the genealogy serves to maintain a record of the lineage of Judah and to demonstrate the continuity of the tribe through successive generations. 

The preservation of such genealogical records was important for the Israelites, as it helped to establish tribal identity, inheritance rights, and the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
