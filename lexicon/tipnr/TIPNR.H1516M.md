The Valley Gate was one of the gates in the wall of Jerusalem, mentioned in the Bible in connection with the city's fortifications and rebuilding. In [[2Chr.26.9|2 Chronicles 26:9]], it is recorded that King Uzziah of Judah built towers at the Corner Gate, the Valley Gate, and the angle of the wall, strengthening Jerusalem's defenses. The Valley Gate is also prominently mentioned in the book of Nehemiah, which describes the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls after the Babylonian exile. Nehemiah inspected the Valley Gate during his nighttime survey of the city's damaged walls \(Neh. 2:13, 15\). Later, during the rebuilding process, Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate, including its doors, bolts, and bars \(Neh. 3:13\). The exact location of the Valley Gate is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated on the western side of Jerusalem, leading to the Hinnom Valley. The Valley Gate's mention in both historical and post-exilic accounts highlights its importance in the defense and security of Jerusalem throughout different periods of the city's history.
