People from Shulam\(?\)

The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Shulammites</span> are mentioned in the Song of Solomon, possibly referring to a group of people or a place associated with the Shulammite woman.
- People from Shulam\(?\), first mentioned at Sng.6.13; 
- only referred to as Shulammites **<big>[[H7759|שׁוּלַמִּית]]</big>**.

The Shulammites are mentioned in Song of Solomon 6:13 \(twice\) in the context of a dialogue between the lovers in the song. The exact meaning and identity of the Shulammites are uncertain, and various interpretations have been proposed. Some scholars suggest that "Shulammite" may refer to a woman from Shunem, a town in the territory of Issachar \(see 1 Kings 1:3,15\). Others propose that it could be a feminine form of "Solomon," indicating a connection to King Solomon or a symbolic name for the beloved woman in the song. The verse depicts the lover asking his beloved to return, so that "we" \(possibly the Shulammites\) may gaze upon her. The Shulammites could represent a group of people, perhaps the daughters of Jerusalem or the friends of the lovers, who are invited to admire the beauty of the beloved woman.
