Eshan is mentioned in [[Josh.15.52|Joshua 15:52]] as one of the cities in the hill country of Judah, which was allotted to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land. It is listed along with other cities such as Arab, Dumah, and Janim. 

No other details about Eshan are provided in the Bible, and its exact location is unknown. The city was situated in the hill country, which is the central mountainous region of Judah, characterized by its rugged terrain and numerous valleys. 

The mention of Eshan in the list of cities allotted to Judah helps to define the extent of the tribe's territory and provides insight into the geography of the region during the time of the Israelite conquest and settlement of Canaan.
