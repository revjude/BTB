- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[1Chr.1.39|Act.13.1]]; 
- only referred to as Lucius **<big>[[G3066|Λούκιος]]</big>**.

Lucius of Cyrene is mentioned in Acts 13:1 as one of the prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch, alongside Barnabas, Simeon \(called Niger\), Manaen \(who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch\), and Saul \(later known as Paul\). Cyrene was a city in modern-day Libya, North Africa, indicating that Lucius may have been of African origin. As a prophet and teacher, Lucius would have been involved in proclaiming God's word and instructing the believers in Antioch. It was during a time of worship and fasting that the Holy Spirit called Barnabas and Saul to be set apart for the work of spreading the gospel to the Gentiles. Lucius, along with the other leaders, laid their hands on Barnabas and Saul and sent them off on their first missionary journey, which marked a significant expansion of the early Christian church. Additionally, Lucius is mentioned in [[Rom.16.21|Romans 16:21]] as a companion of Paul who sends greetings to the church in Rome, further indicating his involvement in the ministry of the early church.
