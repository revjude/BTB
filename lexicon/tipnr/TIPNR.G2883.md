<small>*Male • Centurion, first Gentile convert to Christianity*</small>

Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Cornelius</span>, a centurion, was the first Gentile convert to Christianity through Peter's ministry. \(Act.10\)
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[2Chr.35.9|Act.10.1]]; 
- only referred to as Cornelius<[[G2883]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Κορνήλιος</span>\).

Cornelius was a Roman centurion stationed in Caesarea. He is described as a devout man who feared God, gave alms generously, and prayed regularly \(Acts 10:1-2\). Despite his piety, Cornelius was not a convert to Judaism. 

In a vision, an angel instructed Cornelius to send for Peter, who was staying in Joppa \(Acts 10:3-8\). Meanwhile, Peter had a vision in which God revealed that he should not consider anything unclean that God had made clean, preparing him to accept Gentile believers \(Acts 10:9-16\). 

When Peter arrived at Cornelius' house, Cornelius gathered his relatives and close friends to hear Peter's message \(Acts 10:24-27\). As Peter shared the gospel, the Holy Spirit fell upon the Gentile listeners, confirming that God had accepted them \(Acts 10:44-46\). This event marked a significant turning point in the early church, as it demonstrated that the gospel was for both Jews and Gentiles. 

Peter then ordered that Cornelius and the other believing Gentiles be baptized \(Acts 10:47-48\). The conversion of Cornelius and his household was a pivotal moment in the spread of Christianity, paving the way for the inclusion of Gentiles in the church.
