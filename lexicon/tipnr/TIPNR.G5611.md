The Beautiful Gate, mentioned in Acts 3:2 and 3:10, was one of the gates of the temple in Jerusalem during the time of the early church. It was the location where the apostle Peter, accompanied by John, encountered a man who had been lame from birth. The man was carried daily to the gate to ask for alms from those entering the temple courts. 

As Peter and John approached the gate, the man asked them for money. Instead, Peter commanded the man to walk in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Instantly, the man's feet and ankles were made strong, and he began to walk, leap, and praise God. This miracle attracted the attention of the people, who were astonished to see the man walking and praising God. 

The exact location and appearance of the Beautiful Gate are not described in detail in the Bible. It is believed to have been one of the main entrances to the temple complex, possibly leading from the Court of the Gentiles to the Court of Women. The gate's name suggests that it was likely an ornate and impressive structure. 

The healing of the lame man at the Beautiful Gate was a significant event in the early church, demonstrating the power of the risen Christ and the authority of the apostles to perform miracles in His name. It also provided an opportunity for Peter to preach the gospel to the gathered crowd, resulting in many people coming to believe in Jesus \(Acts 3:11-26\).
