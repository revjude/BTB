Elishama is mentioned as the grandfather of Ishmael, a member of the royal family who assassinated Gedaliah, the governor appointed by the Babylonians over Judah after the fall of Jerusalem \([[2Kgs.25.25|2Ki.25.25]]; [[Jer.41.1|Jer.41.1]]\). Ishmael was the son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama. The Bible describes Elishama as being "of the royal family," indicating his connection to the Davidic line. Apart from this familial connection, no further details are provided about Elishama's life or role. His grandson Ishmael's actions led to political instability and the flight of many Judeans to Egypt, fearing Babylonian retaliation \(2Ki.25.26; [[Jer.41.1|Jer.41.1]]6-18\).
