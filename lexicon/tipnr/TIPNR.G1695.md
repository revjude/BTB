Emmaus was a village located about seven miles \(sixty stadia\) from Jerusalem \(Luk. 24:13\). It is mentioned in the Bible in connection with the events following Jesus' resurrection. On the day of His resurrection, two of Jesus' disciples were walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus, discussing the recent events surrounding Jesus' death and the empty tomb. As they walked, Jesus Himself joined them, but they did not recognize Him. Jesus explained to them the prophecies concerning the Messiah in the Scriptures. When they reached Emmaus, the disciples urged Jesus to stay with them, and as He broke bread with them, their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him \(Luk. 24:13-35\). The exact location of Emmaus is uncertain, as there are several possible sites that have been proposed based on ancient traditions and archaeological evidence.
