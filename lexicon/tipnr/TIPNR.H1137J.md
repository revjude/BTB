Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Bani</span> was one of the men who had married foreign women and agreed to put them away.
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.34|Ezr.10.34]]; 
- only referred to as Bani<[[H1137J]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>ָּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>\).

Bani is listed in [[Ezra.10.34|Ezra 10:34]] among the men who had married foreign women during the time of Ezra. After the return from Babylonian exile, Ezra discovered that many Israelites, including priests and Levites, had intermarried with the neighboring peoples \(Ezra 9:1-2\). This was seen as a violation of God's command not to intermarry with the idolatrous nations \(Deuteronomy 7:3-4\). Ezra called the people to repentance and urged them to separate from their foreign wives \(Ezra 10:10-11\). Bani was one of those who agreed to put away his foreign wife in obedience to God's law. This act demonstrated a commitment to holiness and a desire to maintain the distinct identity of the Jewish community.
