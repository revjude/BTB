Woman \(?\) living at the time of Divided Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Hodiah</span> was the wife of Ishbar or Mered, a descendant of Judah, and the mother of several notable individuals.
- A woman\(?\) from the tribe of Judah\(?\) living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.4.19|1Ch.4.19]]; 
- only referred to as Hodiah **<big>[[H1940|הוֹדִיָּה]]</big>**; 
- sister of Naham **<big>[[H5163|נַחַם]]</big>**; 
- wife of Ishbah **<big>[[H3431|יִשְׁבַּח]]</big>**.

Hodiah is mentioned in [[1Chr.4.19|1 Chronicles 4:19]] as the wife of a man named Ishbar or Mered, who was a descendant of Judah. The text is complex, but states either that she is married  to Ishbah or that she is one of the wives of his father Mered. She is described as the sister of Naham. 

Hodiah gave birth to several children, including the father of Keilah the Garmite and Eshtemoa the Maacathite. These individuals were likely significant figures or groups within their respective communities, as they are mentioned by their place of origin or association. 

The inclusion of Hodiah in this genealogy of Judah underscores the importance of family lineage and the role of women in the history of Israel. Although no further details are provided about Hodiah's life, her mention in the biblical record indicates that she was an ancestor of notable individuals within the tribe of Judah. 

The passage also highlights the practice of polygamy in ancient Israel, as Mered is recorded as having two wives. However, the biblical text does not provide any commentary on the practice itself, focusing instead on the genealogical record and the descendants of these unions.
