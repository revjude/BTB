Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Hymenaeus</span> was a man who had rejected the faith and was handed over to Satan by Paul so that he might learn not to blaspheme.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[1Tim.1.20|1Ti.1.20]]; 
- only referred to as Hymenaeus<[[G5211]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ὑμεναῖος</span>\).

Hymenaeus is mentioned in two of Paul's epistles to Timothy \([[1Tim.1.20|1 Timothy 1:20]] and [[2Tim.2.17|2 Timothy 2:17]]\) as a man who had strayed from the truth and was causing harm to the faith of others. 

In [[1Tim.1.20|1 Timothy 1:20]], Paul states that he had handed Hymenaeus and Alexander over to Satan so that they might learn not to blaspheme. This suggests that Hymenaeus had engaged in blasphemous speech or teachings that were contrary to the gospel. By handing him over to Satan, Paul likely meant that he had removed Hymenaeus from the protection and fellowship of the church, allowing him to experience the consequences of his sin with the hope that he would repent and return to the truth. 

In [[2Tim.2.17|2 Timothy 2:17]], Hymenaeus is mentioned along with Philetus as individuals who had departed from the truth and were promoting the false teaching that the resurrection had already taken place. This heretical view was undermining the faith of some believers. Paul compares their false teaching to gangrene, emphasizing its destructive nature and the need to confront it. 

These passages highlight the importance of maintaining sound doctrine and the need to address false teachings that can lead people astray. They also demonstrate the role of church discipline in correcting those who persist in promoting views that are contrary to the gospel.
