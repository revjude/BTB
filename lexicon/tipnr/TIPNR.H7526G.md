- A king living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Kgs.15.37|2Ki.15.37]]; 
- only referred to as Rezin **<big>[[H7526|רְצִין]]</big>**.

Rezin was the king of Aram \(Syria\) during the reign of Ahaz, king of Judah \([[2Kgs.15.37|2 Kings 15:37]]; 16:5-6, 9; [[Isa.7.1|Isaiah 7:1]], 4, 8; 8:6; 9:11\). He formed an alliance with Pekah, king of Israel, to attack Judah \([[Isa.7.1|Isaiah 7:1]]\). Their goal was to replace Ahaz with a king who would join their coalition against the growing threat of the Assyrian Empire \(Isaiah 7:6\). The alliance between Rezin and Pekah caused great distress to Ahaz and the people of Judah \(Isaiah 7:2\). In response, the prophet Isaiah encouraged Ahaz to trust in God and not fear the two "smoldering stubs of firewood" \(Isaiah 7:3-9\). Rezin and Pekah's attack on Jerusalem was unsuccessful \([[2Kgs.16.5|2 Kings 16:5]]\). However, Rezin was able to capture the city of Elath and drive out the Judahites living there \([[2Kgs.16.6|2 Kings 16:6]]\). Ahaz, instead of relying on God, sought help from Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria, by sending him tribute \(2 Kings 16:7-8\). Tiglath-pileser responded by attacking Damascus, the capital of Aram. He captured the city, killed Rezin, and deported the Aramean people to Kir \([[2Kgs.16.9|2 Kings 16:9]]\). This event fulfilled Isaiah's prophecy about the defeat of Aram and the death of Rezin within 65 years \([[Isa.7.8|Isaiah 7:8]]-9\). The downfall of Rezin and the Aramean kingdom was a significant moment in the history of the region, demonstrating the rising power of the Assyrian Empire and the consequences of forming alliances against God's people.
