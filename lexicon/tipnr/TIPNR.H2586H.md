- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.3.13|Neh.3.13]]; 
- only referred to as Hanun **<big>[[H2586|חָנוּן]]</big>**.

Hanun is mentioned in [[Neh.3.13|Nehemiah 3:13]] as one of the individuals who helped repair the Valley Gate during the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem. Under the leadership of Nehemiah, the Israelites who had returned from Babylonian captivity took on the task of restoring the city's fortifications. The repair work was divided among various groups and individuals, each responsible for a specific section of the wall. Hanun, along with the inhabitants of Zanoah, repaired the Valley Gate, which was one of the main entrances to the city. They also repaired a section of the wall measuring a thousand cubits \(approximately 450 meters or 1,500 feet\) from the Valley Gate to the Refuse Gate. The mention of Hanun in this context highlights the collective effort and participation of the Israelites in the restoration of Jerusalem's defenses. It also demonstrates the importance of unity and cooperation in achieving a common goal.
