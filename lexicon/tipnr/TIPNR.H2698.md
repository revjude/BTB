Hazeroth was a place where the Israelites camped during their wilderness wanderings after leaving Mount Sinai. It is mentioned several times in the book of Numbers and once in Deuteronomy \(Num 11:35; 12:16; 33:17-18; Deut 1:1\). The name "Hazeroth" is derived from the Hebrew word "hatser," meaning "enclosure" or "court," suggesting that the site may have had some form of semi-permanent structures. At Hazeroth, Moses faced challenges to his leadership from his siblings, Aaron and Miriam \(Num 12\). God affirmed Moses' unique role as His chosen leader and judged Miriam with temporary leprosy. The Israelites remained at Hazeroth for an unspecified period before setting out into the wilderness of Paran \([[Num.12.16|Num.12.16]]\). The exact location of Hazeroth is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the Sinai Peninsula, between Mount Sinai and Kadesh-barnea.
