Thessalonica was a major city in Macedonia, located on the Thermaic Gulf. It was an important commercial and political center during the Roman period. The apostle Paul visited Thessalonica during his second missionary journey, accompanied by Silas and Timothy \(Acts 17:1-9\). Paul preached in the synagogue for three Sabbaths, reasoning from the Scriptures about Jesus as the Messiah. Some Jews and a large number of God-fearing Greeks, including prominent women, believed and joined Paul and Silas. However, jealous Jews formed a mob and caused an uproar in the city, accusing Paul and Silas of defying Caesar's decrees. The believers sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. Despite the opposition, a strong church was established in Thessalonica. Paul later wrote two epistles to the Thessalonian church, addressing their concerns and encouraging them in their faith \(1 Thess. 1:1; 2 Thess. 1:1\). Thessalonica is also mentioned in connection with Paul's travels and ministry \(Acts 20:4; 27:2; Phil. 4:16; 2 Tim. 4:10\).
