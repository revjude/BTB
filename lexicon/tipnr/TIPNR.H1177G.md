Baal-hanan was one of the kings who reigned in Edom before Israel had kings. He is mentioned in the lists of Edomite kings found in [[Gen.36.38|Genesis 36:38]]-39 and [[1Chr.1.49|1 Chronicles 1:49]]-50. Baal-hanan is described as the son of Achbor, and he succeeded Shaul as king of Edom. After his death, Hadad became king in his place. The text does not provide any details about the length or events of Baal-hanan's reign. His name, which means "Baal is gracious," suggests that the Canaanite deity Baal was worshiped in Edom at that time.
