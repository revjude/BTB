Enan is mentioned in the Bible as the father of Ahira, who was the leader of the tribe of Naphtali during the Israelites' wilderness journey after the Exodus from Egypt. Enan's name appears multiple times in the book of Numbers in connection with his son's leadership role. In the census of the Israelites taken in the wilderness of Sinai, Ahira son of Enan is listed as the leader of the tribe of Naphtali \([[Num.1.15|Num.1.15]]\). The tribe of Naphtali, under Ahira's leadership, was positioned on the north side of the tabernacle, along with the tribes of Dan and Asher \([[Num.2.29|Num.2.29]]\). During the dedication of the tabernacle, Ahira son of Enan brought the offering for the tribe of Naphtali on the twelfth day \([[Num.7.78|Num.7.78]],83\). Later, when the Israelites set out from the wilderness of Sinai, the tribe of Naphtali, led by Ahira, was assigned to march last, along with the tribes of Dan and Asher \([[Num.10.27|Num.10.27]]\). Although Enan himself is not mentioned in any other context, his repeated mention as the father of Ahira highlights the significance of family lineage in the leadership structure of the Israelite tribes during their wilderness journey.
