- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Luke.1.3|Luk.1.3]]; 
- only referred to as Theophilus **<big>[[G2321|Θεόφιλος]]</big>**.

Theophilus is mentioned in [[Luke.1.3|Luke 1:3]] and Acts 1:1 as the recipient of these two books written by Luke. He is addressed as "most excellent Theophilus," indicating a person of high social or political standing, possibly a Roman official or a wealthy benefactor of the church. Luke states that he wrote his Gospel to provide Theophilus with an orderly account of the life and teachings of Jesus, based on eyewitness testimonies. The Book of Acts, also addressed to Theophilus, continues the narrative of the early church's growth and mission. The dedication suggests that Theophilus was a Christian who had received some instruction in the faith but needed a more comprehensive understanding. No other details are provided about Theophilus' background, conversion, or role in the church. His identity remains unknown, but his mention reflects the importance of written accounts in transmitting and confirming the gospel message for believers.
