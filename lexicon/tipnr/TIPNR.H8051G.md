Shammua, mentioned in [[Num.13.4|Numbers 13:4]], was one of the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan. He was the son of Zaccur and represented the tribe of Reuben. The twelve spies, one from each tribe, were chosen to assess the land, its inhabitants, and its resources. After forty days of exploration, the spies returned with their report. While ten of the spies brought back a discouraging report, emphasizing the strength of the inhabitants and the fortified cities, Caleb and Joshua, two of the spies, remained confident in God's promise and encouraged the people to trust in Him. The text does not provide any specific details about Shammua's role or his perspective during this mission. However, his inclusion in the list of spies highlights the importance of the task and the representation of each tribe in the reconnaissance of the Promised Land.
