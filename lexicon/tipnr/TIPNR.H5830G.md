Ezra was a prominent Jewish priest and scribe who lived during the Persian period. He was a descendant of Aaron, the first high priest of Israel \([[Ezra.7.1|Ezra 7:1]]-5\). Ezra was known for his devotion to the study and teaching of the Law of Moses \([[Ezra.7.6|Ezra 7:6]], 10\). He led a group of Jewish exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes of Persia \(Ezra 7:7-8\). Upon arriving in Jerusalem, Ezra discovered that many of the Jews, including priests and Levites, had intermarried with the pagan peoples of the land \(Ezra 9:1-2\). Ezra prayed and confessed the sins of the people, leading to a spiritual reformation and the dissolution of the mixed marriages \(Ezra 10\). Ezra also played a significant role in teaching the Law to the people and leading them in a covenant renewal ceremony \(Nehemiah 8\). He worked closely with Nehemiah, the governor of Judah, in rebuilding Jerusalem and restoring the spiritual life of the Jewish community \([[Neh.12.26|Nehemiah 12:26]], 36\).
