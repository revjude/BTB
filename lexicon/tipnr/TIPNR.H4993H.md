Mattithiah was a Levite who served as a musician during the reign of King David. He was among the Levites appointed by David to lead the music and praise in the tabernacle \([[1Chr.15.18|1 Chronicles 15:18]], 21\). Mattithiah is specifically mentioned as a harpist, playing the harp to accompany the singing of psalms and hymns \([[1Chr.16.5|1 Chronicles 16:5]]\). He was also one of the sons of Jeduthun, a chief musician in David's court, and was responsible for leading the fourteenth division of musicians \([[1Chr.25.3|1 Chronicles 25:3]], 21\). Mattithiah's role as a musician highlights the importance of worship and the use of music in the Israelite religious practices during David's reign.
