Ahitub was the father of Ahimelech, who served as the priest at Nob during the reign of King Saul. Ahitub's other son, Ahijah, also served as a priest and wore an ephod, indicating his priestly role. \([[1Sam.14.3|1Sa.14.3]]\) 

When David fled from Saul, he came to Ahimelech at Nob seeking help. Ahimelech provided David with the consecrated bread and the sword of Goliath. \(1Sa.21.1-9\) However, Doeg the Edomite, one of Saul's servants, witnessed this interaction and reported it to Saul. \([[1Sam.22.9|1Sa.22.9]]-10\). 

Saul summoned Ahimelech and the other priests, accusing them of conspiring with David against him. Despite Ahimelech's defense of his actions, Saul ordered the execution of the priests. Doeg carried out the order, killing Ahimelech, along with eighty-four other priests who were from the family of Ahitub. \([[1Sam.22.11|1Sa.22.11]]-19\) 

Only Abiathar, Ahimelech's son, escaped the massacre and fled to David, bringing with him the ephod. \([[1Sam.22.20|1Sa.22.20]]-23\) The tragedy that befell Ahitub's family highlights the tension between Saul and David and the consequences faced by those caught in the middle of their conflict.
