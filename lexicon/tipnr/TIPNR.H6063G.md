Aner was an Amorite, mentioned in the book of Genesis as one of the three allies of Abram \(later known as Abraham\). Along with his brothers Mamre and Eshcol, Aner joined forces with Abram to pursue and defeat the kings who had taken Abram's nephew Lot captive. After the successful rescue of Lot and the recovery of the goods that had been taken, Abram gave a tenth of the spoils to Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of God Most High. Aner, along with Eshcol and Mamre, received their share of the remaining spoils, as they had fought alongside Abram in the battle.
