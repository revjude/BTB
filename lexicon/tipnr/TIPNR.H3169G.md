Jehizkiah is mentioned in [[2Chr.28.12|2 Chronicles 28:12]] as one of the leaders of the tribe of Ephraim who opposed the actions of the Israelite army during the reign of King Ahaz of Judah. The army had just returned from a successful campaign against Judah, bringing back a large number of captives and plunder. However, Jehizkiah, along with Azariah, Berechiah, and Amasa, confronted the army and urged them not to bring the captives into Samaria, warning that this would only add to Israel's guilt before God. They argued that the army's actions had already provoked God's anger and that taking the captives would further incur his wrath. As a result of their intervention, the army released the captives, provided them with clothing and food, and sent them back to Judah. Jehizkiah's actions demonstrate his concern for righteousness and his willingness to stand up against wrongdoing, even in the face of military success.
