Shimei is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.23|Ezra 10:23]] as one of the Levites who had married foreign women during the Babylonian exile. After the return to Jerusalem, Ezra the scribe led a religious reform that required the Israelites to separate themselves from their foreign wives to maintain the purity of the nation. Shimei, along with several other Levites, priests, and leaders, was found to have married a foreign woman. As part of the reform, Shimei agreed to send away his foreign wife and children, demonstrating his commitment to following God's law and maintaining the religious and cultural identity of the Israelites.
