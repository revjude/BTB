The Hebron Valley is mentioned in [[Gen.37.14|Genesis 37:14]] as the location from which Joseph was sent by his father, Israel \(or 'Jacob'\), to find his brothers. The brothers had gone to pasture their flocks near Shechem, and Jacob instructed Joseph to go and check on their well-being. The Hebron Valley was likely in the vicinity of Hebron, a city located in the hill country of Judah, approximately 19 miles south of Jerusalem. The fact that Joseph traveled from the Hebron Valley to Shechem, a distance of about 50 miles, demonstrates the significant distance he had to cover to find his brothers.
