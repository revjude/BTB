Obed-edom was a Gittite in whose house the Ark of the Covenant stayed for three months after the death of Uzzah \([[2Sam.6.10|2 Samuel 6:10]]-12; [[1Chr.13.13|1 Chronicles 13:13]]-14\). When David attempted to bring the Ark to Jerusalem, Uzzah was struck down by God for touching the Ark. Fearful of further divine judgment, David left the Ark in the house of Obed-edom. During its stay, Obed-edom's household was blessed by God \(1 Chronicles 13:14\). Later, when David brought the Ark to Jerusalem, Obed-edom and his family were appointed as gatekeepers and musicians in the tabernacle \([[1Chr.15.18|1 Chronicles 15:18]], 21, 24; 16:5, 38\). Obed-edom had eight sons, all of whom served in the tabernacle \([[1Chr.26.4|1 Chronicles 26:4]]-8\). He is also mentioned as a Levite in the context of the temple treasuries \([[2Chr.25.24|2 Chronicles 25:24]]\). Obed-edom's faithfulness and the blessings he received highlight the importance of reverence for the Ark and the presence of God.
