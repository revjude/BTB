Rechab is mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as the father of Malchijah, one of the people who helped repair the walls of Jerusalem \([[Neh.3.14|Nehemiah 3:14]]\). During the time of Nehemiah, the walls of Jerusalem were in disrepair, leaving the city vulnerable to attack. Nehemiah, who was serving as cupbearer to King Artaxerxes of Persia, received permission to return to Jerusalem and oversee the rebuilding of the walls \(Nehemiah 2:1-8\). Various individuals and families were assigned to repair specific sections of the wall. Malchijah, son of Rechab, was responsible for repairing the Dung Gate, which was likely located on the southern side of the city and used for removing refuse \([[Neh.3.14|Nehemiah 3:14]]\). The mention of Rechab in this context highlights the participation of families in the restoration of Jerusalem's defenses and the importance of each person's contribution to the overall project.
