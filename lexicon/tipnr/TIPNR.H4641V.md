Maaseiah was a priest who participated in the dedication of Jerusalem's wall during the time of Nehemiah \([[Neh.12.41|Neh.12.41]]\). After the completion of the wall's reconstruction, Nehemiah organized a grand dedication ceremony that involved two large choirs processing around the city on top of the wall \(Neh.12.27-43\). Maaseiah is listed among the priests who blew trumpets during this celebratory event, along with other priests and Levites. The dedication of the wall was a significant moment in the restoration of Jerusalem, marking the completion of a major project and the reestablishment of the city's defenses. Maaseiah's participation in this event highlights the role of the priests in the religious and civic life of the community.
