- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[2Chr.23.1|2Ch.23.1]]; 
- only referred to as Adaiah **<big>[[H5718|עֲדָיָה]]</big>**; 
-  father of Maaseiah **<big>[[H4641|מַעֲשֵׂיָה]]</big>**.

Adaiah is mentioned in [[2Chr.23.1|2 Chronicles 23:1]] as the father of Maaseiah, who was one of the captains involved in the coup against Athaliah, the queen who had usurped the throne of Judah. Adaiah's son Maaseiah, along with other captains and Levites, was gathered by Jehoiada the priest to support the installation of Joash, the rightful heir to the throne, as king. 

The narrative in 2 Chronicles 23 describes how Jehoiada the priest organized a group of loyal captains, including Maaseiah, to protect Joash and overthrow Athaliah's reign. They strategically positioned themselves in the temple and proclaimed Joash as king, leading to the downfall of Athaliah and the restoration of the Davidic dynasty. 

Apart from being the father of Maaseiah, no other information is provided about Adaiah himself. His mention in the narrative serves to identify Maaseiah and to highlight the role of various individuals and families in the significant event of Joash's ascension to the throne and the removal of Athaliah's illegitimate rule.
