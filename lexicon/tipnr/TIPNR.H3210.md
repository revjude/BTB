Jalon is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.4.17|1 Chronicles 4:17]] as one of the sons of Ezrah, along with his brothers Jether and Mered. Ezrah was a descendant of Judah, the son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\), through Perez. The text does not provide any further information about Jalon's life, occupation, or role within the tribe of Judah. His mention in the genealogy suggests that he was an ancestor of some of the families within the tribe of Judah, although no specific details are given about his descendants.
