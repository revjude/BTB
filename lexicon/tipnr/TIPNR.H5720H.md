Adin is mentioned in [[Neh.10.16|Nehemiah 10:16]] as one of the leaders of the people who signed the covenant of faithfulness to God during the time of Nehemiah. This covenant was made after the completion of the wall of Jerusalem and the public reading of the Book of the Law. 

In Nehemiah 9, the people of Israel gathered to confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors. They acknowledged God's goodness and faithfulness, despite their disobedience and the disobedience of their forefathers. Following this confession, the leaders of the people, including Adin, signed a covenant to follow God's law and to keep His commandments \(Nehemiah 10:1-29\). 

The signing of this covenant was a significant event in the spiritual reformation of the Jewish community after their return from Babylonian exile. It demonstrated their commitment to God and their desire to live according to His will. 

Apart from being listed among the signatories of the covenant, no other information is provided about Adin's specific role, background, or family. His inclusion in the list highlights the unity and shared commitment of the leaders and the people in their dedication to God and His law.
