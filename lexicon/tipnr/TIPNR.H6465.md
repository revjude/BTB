Peor was a mountain located in the land of Moab, east of the Jordan River. It is mentioned in the context of Balak, the king of Moab, who sought to curse Israel through the prophet Balaam \(Num. 23:28\). Balak brought Balaam to the top of Peor, hoping that from there, Balaam would be able to curse the Israelites. However, God intervened and caused Balaam to bless Israel instead \(Num. 23:29-24:9\). 

Later, when the Israelites were camped in the plains of Moab, they began to engage in idolatry and sexual immorality with the Moabites \(Num. 25:1-3\). This incident became known as the "matter of Peor" \(Num. 25:18; 31:16\) and resulted in a plague that killed 24,000 Israelites \(Num. 25:9\). The Israelites' sin at Peor was remembered as a cautionary tale, warning against the dangers of idolatry and foreign influences \(Josh. 22:17; Ps. 106:28-29\). The events at Peor highlight the importance of remaining faithful to God and resisting the temptations of surrounding pagan cultures.
