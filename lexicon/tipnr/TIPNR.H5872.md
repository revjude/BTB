Engedi, also known as Hazazon-tamar, is an oasis located on the western shore of the Dead Sea, in the wilderness of Judah. It is mentioned several times in the Bible, often in the context of its strategic location and its lush vegetation. 

During the time of Abraham, Engedi \(then called Hazazon-tamar\) was one of the places where Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and his allies defeated the Amorites before attacking Sodom and Gomorrah \([[Gen.14.7|Genesis 14:7]]; [[2Chr.20.2|2 Chronicles 20:2]]\). 

Later, when David was fleeing from King Saul, he sought refuge in the strongholds of Engedi \([[1Sam.23.29|1 Samuel 23:29]]\). It was in the wilderness of Engedi that David had the opportunity to kill Saul but chose to spare his life, cutting off a corner of Saul's robe instead \([[1Sam.24.1|1 Samuel 24:1]]-7\). 

The Song of Solomon mentions Engedi as a source of fragrant henna blossoms \(Song of Solomon 1:14\), testifying to its fertility and beauty. In Ezekiel's vision of the restored land of Israel, Engedi is mentioned as a place where fishermen will spread their nets, symbolizing abundance and prosperity \([[Ezek.47.10|Ezekiel 47:10]]\). 

The name Engedi means "spring of the kid \(young goat\)" or "fountain of the goat," likely referring to the freshwater springs that make the area an oasis in the desert. Today, Engedi is a nature reserve in Israel, known for its hiking trails, waterfalls, and diverse flora and fauna.
