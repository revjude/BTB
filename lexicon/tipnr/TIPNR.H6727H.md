Man living at the time of Exile and Return

The temple servants, including the family of <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Ziha</span>, lived on Ophel in Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah \([[Neh.11.21|Neh.11.21]]\).
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.11.21|Neh.11.21]]; 
- only referred to as Ziha **<big>[[H6727|צִיחָא]]</big>**.

In Nehemiah 11, Ziha is mentioned again as one of the families of temple servants \(Nethinim\) who lived in Jerusalem after the return from Babylonian exile. The passage specifies that the temple servants lived on the Ophel, which was a hill located near the temple mount in Jerusalem. This suggests that the Nethinim, including the family of Ziha, were given living quarters in close proximity to the temple, allowing them to easily carry out their duties in assisting the Levites. The chapter provides a list of the residents of Jerusalem, including various officials, leaders, and groups responsible for maintaining the city and the temple. The mention of the temple servants and their location on the Ophel underscores their important role in supporting the temple worship and the religious life of the community.
