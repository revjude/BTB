Cushan is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Hab.3.7|Habakkuk 3:7]], where it is listed alongside the "tents of Midian" in a passage describing the prophet Habakkuk's vision of God's judgment. The verse reads, "I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; the curtains of the land of Midian trembled." 

The exact location and identity of Cushan are uncertain, as there is no other mention of it in the Bible or other historical sources. Some scholars suggest that Cushan might be related to Cush, the ancient region in Africa, due to the similarity in names. Others propose that it could be a reference to a Midianite tribe or another unidentified location. 

Given the limited information available, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about Cushan. However, its mention alongside Midian in the context of God's judgment suggests that it may have been a place or people group that experienced divine punishment or was affected by the events described in Habakkuk's vision.
