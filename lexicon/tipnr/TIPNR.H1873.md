<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Dara</span> was a son of Zerah and grandson of Judah. \([[1Chr.2.6|1Ch.2.6]]\)
- A man from the tribe of Judah living before Israel's Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.2.6|1Ch.2.6]]; 
- only referred to as Dara **<big>[[H1873|דָּרַע]]</big>**; 
-  son of Zerah **<big>[[H2226|זֶרַח]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Zabdi **<big>[[H2067|זַבְדִּי]]</big>**, Ethan **<big>[[H0387|אֵיתָן]]</big>**, Heman **<big>[[H1968|הֵימָן]]</big>** and Calcol **<big>[[H3633|כַּלְכֹּל]]</big>**.

Dara is mentioned in [[1Chr.2.6|1 Chronicles 2:6]] as one of the five sons of Zerah, along with Zimri, Ethan, Heman, and Calcol. Zerah was one of the twin sons of Judah, born to Tamar \(Genesis 38:30\). 

As a grandson of Judah, Dara was part of the tribe of Judah, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The tribe of Judah played a significant role in Israel's history, as it was prophesied that the Messiah would come from this tribe \(Genesis 49:10\). 

Apart from being listed in the genealogy of Judah, no other details about Dara's life or role are provided in the Bible. The genealogies in 1 Chronicles trace the lineage of the tribes of Israel, demonstrating the importance of family heritage and the fulfillment of God's promises through the generations.
