Habakkuk was a prophet who lived in Judah, likely during the late 7th century BC, before the Babylonian exile. The book of Habakkuk, which bears his name, records a unique dialogue between the prophet and God. Habakkuk questioned God's justice, asking why evil seemed to go unpunished and the righteous suffered \(Habakkuk 1:2-4\). God responded by revealing His plan to use the Babylonians to punish Judah's wickedness \(Habakkuk 1:5-11\). Habakkuk then struggled with the idea of God using a wicked nation to punish His people \([[Hab.1.1|Habakkuk 1:1]]2-2:1\). God assured Habakkuk that the Babylonians would also face judgment for their sins, and that the righteous would live by faith \(Habakkuk 2:2-20\). The book concludes with a prayer of Habakkuk, in which he expresses his trust in God despite the difficult circumstances \([[Hab.3.1|Habakkuk 3:1]]-19\). Habakkuk's message emphasizes the importance of faith and trust in God, even when His ways are difficult to understand.
