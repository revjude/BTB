Man living at the time of Exile and Return

- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.39|Ezr.10.39]]; 
- only referred to as Adaiah **<big>[[H5718|עֲדָיָה]]</big>**.

Adaiah, a priest mentioned in the book of Ezra, was among those who had married foreign women during the post-exilic period \([[Ezra.10.39|Ezra 10:39]]\). He was a descendant of Harim, one of the priestly families that returned to Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. 

During the religious reform led by Ezra, it was discovered that many Israelites, including priests and Levites, had married women from the surrounding nations. This was considered a violation of God's law, which prohibited intermarriage with the pagan peoples of the land \(Ezra 10:10-11\). 

Adaiah was one of the priests who had taken a foreign wife. In response to Ezra's call for repentance, he and the other offenders pledged to put away their foreign wives and children, demonstrating their commitment to obey God's law and maintain the purity of the Israelite community. 

No further details are provided about Adaiah's personal life or the specific consequences he faced in separating from his foreign wife. His inclusion in the list of priests who had married foreign women highlights the extent of the problem and the importance of addressing it to ensure the spiritual integrity of the community.
