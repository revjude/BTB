Pagiel, son of Ochran, was the leader of the tribe of Asher during the Israelites' wilderness wanderings \([[Num.1.13|Numbers 1:13]]\). He is mentioned several times in the book of Numbers as one of the leaders who assisted Moses in the census and organization of the Israelite camp \([[Num.1.13|Numbers 1:13]]; 2:27; 7:72, 77; 10:26\). In the census, Pagiel was responsible for counting the men of military age in his tribe \(Numbers 1:41\). He also brought an offering on behalf of his tribe during the dedication of the tabernacle \([[Num.7.72|Numbers 7:72]], 77\). As the leader of Asher, Pagiel would have been responsible for overseeing the affairs of his tribe, settling disputes, and representing their interests before Moses and the other tribal leaders. His presence in the various lists and events in Numbers highlights the importance of the tribal structure and leadership in the organization and governance of the Israelite community during their journey through the wilderness.
