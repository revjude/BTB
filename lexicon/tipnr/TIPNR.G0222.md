Alexandria, a prominent city in Egypt, is mentioned in the book of Acts in connection with Paul's journey to Rome. In Acts 27:6, Paul and his companions boarded a ship from Alexandria sailing to Italy. Later, in Acts 28:11, they departed from the island of Malta on another Alexandrian ship. Alexandria was known for its strategic location, serving as a major port and center of trade in the Mediterranean world. In Acts 6:9, the Synagogue of the Freedmen, which included Jews from Alexandria, is mentioned as being among those who disputed with Stephen. Alexandria had a significant Jewish population and was a center of Hellenistic culture and learning.
