- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Rom.16.14|Rom.16.14]]; 
- only referred to as Phlegon **<big>[[G5393|Φλέγων]]</big>**.

Phlegon is mentioned in Paul's letter to the Romans as one of the believers in Rome to whom Paul sends greetings \([[Rom.16.14|Romans 16:14]]\). He is listed alongside Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and other unnamed brethren, suggesting that they were part of a house church or a close-knit group within the larger Christian community in Rome. The name Phlegon means "burning" or "zealous" in Greek, which may indicate his fervor for the faith. However, no further details about Phlegon's background, conversion, or role in the Roman church are provided in the Bible. Paul's greeting to Phlegon and the others demonstrates the unity and love that existed among the early Christians, even across geographical distances.
