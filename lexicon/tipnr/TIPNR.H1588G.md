Uzza is mentioned in the Bible as a garden in Jerusalem where two kings of Judah, Manasseh and his son Amon, were buried \(2 Kgs. 21:18, 26\). Manasseh, who reigned for 55 years, was known for his wickedness and idolatry, leading the people of Judah astray \(2 Kgs. 21:1-9\). However, after being captured by the Assyrians, Manasseh repented and sought the Lord \(2 Chr. 33:10-13\). Upon his return to Jerusalem, he attempted to undo some of the damage caused by his earlier actions \(2 Chr. 33:14-16\). After Manasseh's death, he was buried in his own house, in the garden of Uzza \(2 Kgs. 21:18\). Amon, Manasseh's son, succeeded him as king but continued in the evil ways of his father's earlier reign. After ruling for only two years, Amon was assassinated by his servants and was also buried in the garden of Uzza \(2 Kgs. 21:19-26\). The exact location of the garden of Uzza is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely a royal garden or burial ground near the king's palace in Jerusalem.
