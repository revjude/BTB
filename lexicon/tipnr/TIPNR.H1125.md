Ben-abinadab is mentioned in [[1Kgs.4.11|1 Kings 4:11]] as one of the twelve officials appointed by King Solomon to oversee the provision of food for the king and his household. Each official was responsible for supplying provisions for one month out of the year. Ben-abinadab's district included the region of Dor, and he is noted as being married to Taphath, one of Solomon's daughters. This marriage alliance likely strengthened Ben-abinadab's position within Solomon's administration and ensured his loyalty to the king. The appointment of these twelve officials and the strategic marriage alliances demonstrate Solomon's wisdom in organizing his kingdom and securing the support of influential individuals.
