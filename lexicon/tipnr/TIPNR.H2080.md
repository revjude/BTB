Zebidah is mentioned in the biblical record as the mother of Jehoiakim, who became king of Judah. She was the daughter of Pedaiah from the town of Rumah. Zebidah's husband was Josiah, the king of Judah who instituted significant religious reforms. After Josiah's death, their son Jehoiakim ascended to the throne at the age of twenty-five and reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. However, Jehoiakim did not follow in his father's footsteps and did evil in the sight of the Lord.
