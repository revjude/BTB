<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Jahath</span> was a Levite, the son of Shelomoth, and a descendant of Izhar \([[1Chr.24.22|1Ch.24.22]]\).
- A man from the tribe of Levi living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.24.22|1Ch.24.22]]; 
- only referred to as Jahath **<big>[[H3189|יַחַת]]</big>**; 
- a son of Shelomith **<big>[[H8019|שְׁלֹמִית]]</big>**.

Jahath is mentioned in [[1Chr.24.22|1 Chronicles 24:22]] as a Levite, the son of Shelomoth, and a descendant of Izhar. This passage is part of a larger section that describes the divisions of the Levites for their service in the temple during the reign of King David. 

The Levites were one of the twelve tribes of Israel, set apart for religious duties and the service of the tabernacle and later the temple. Izhar was one of the sons of Kohath, who was one of the three main divisions of the Levites, along with Gershon and Merari \(1Ch.23.6,12\). 

In this context, Jahath is listed as the son of Shelomoth, who was a descendant of Izhar \([[1Chr.24.22|1Ch.24.22]]\). The text is providing a genealogical record of the Levites who were appointed to serve in the temple, organized according to their ancestral houses. 

No other specific details are provided about Jahath's life, role, or responsibilities as a Levite. His inclusion in this genealogical record, however, highlights the importance of the Levitical lineage and the organization of the Levites for their service in the temple during the time of David.
