Azariah is mentioned in 2 Chronicles 21:2 as one of the sons of King Jehoshaphat of Judah. He was a brother of Jehoram, who succeeded Jehoshaphat as king. Jehoshaphat gave his sons many gifts of silver, gold, and valuable possessions, along with fortified cities in Judah. However, he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the firstborn. The text does not provide further details about Azariah's life or role in the kingdom. The mention of Azariah and his brothers receiving gifts and cities from their father suggests that Jehoshaphat sought to provide for his sons and ensure their well-being, even as he passed the throne to his eldest son.
