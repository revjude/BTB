- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.10.25|Neh.10.25]]; 
- only referred to as Rehum<[[H7348H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>חו</span>ּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ם</span>\).

Rehum is mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as one of the individuals who sealed the covenant \([[Neh.10.25|Nehemiah 10:25]]\). After the completion of the wall of Jerusalem and the public reading of the Law, the people of Israel made a covenant to follow God's commands and to separate themselves from the surrounding nations \(Nehemiah 9-10\). The leaders of the people, including priests, Levites, and heads of families, sealed this covenant as a sign of their commitment \(Nehemiah 10:1-27\). Rehum was among these individuals, likely representing his family or clan. The sealing of the covenant was a significant moment in the spiritual renewal of the Jewish people after their return from Babylonian exile, and it demonstrated their dedication to obeying God's laws and maintaining their distinct identity as His chosen people.
