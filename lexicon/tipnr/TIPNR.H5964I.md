- A man from the tribe of Benjamin living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Chr.8.36|1Ch.8.36]]; 
- only referred to as Alemeth<[[H5964I]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>ֶ֫<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>מ</span>ֶ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ת</span>\); 
-  son of Jehoaddah<[[H3085]]>; 
- a brother of Azmaveth<[[H5820H]]> and Zimri<[[H2174H]]>.

Alemeth is mentioned in the genealogies of the tribe of Benjamin, specifically in the lineage of Saul, the first king of Israel. He is listed as a son of Jehoaddah \(or 'Jehoadah'\), who was a descendant of Jeiel, the father of Gibeon. \([[1Chr.8.36|1Ch.8.36]]; 9.42\) 

The genealogies in 1 Chronicles 8 and 9 provide a detailed record of the Benjamite families, particularly those associated with Saul's lineage. Alemeth is mentioned alongside his brothers, Azmaveth and Zimri, as well as other descendants of Jehoadah. \([[1Chr.8.36|1Ch.8.36]]; 9.42\) 

The repetition of this genealogy in both chapters suggests its importance in establishing the lineage of Saul and his family. It also highlights the significance of the Benjamite clan from Gibeon, which played a role in the early monarchy of Israel. 

Apart from being listed in the genealogies, no further details are provided about Alemeth's life, his role within the family, or any specific events associated with him. 

The inclusion of Alemeth in the genealogies serves to document the Benjamite lineage and to demonstrate the continuity of the family line from the time of Saul to the post-exilic period when the Chronicles were written.
