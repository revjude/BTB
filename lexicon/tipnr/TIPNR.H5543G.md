Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Sallu</span> was a Benjamite leader who settled in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile, as recorded in Nehemiah 11.
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.11.7|Neh.11.7]]; 
- only referred to as Sallu **<big>[[H5543|סַלּוּ]]</big>**; 
- a son of Meshullam **<big>[[H4918|מְשֻׁלָּם]]</big>**.

Sallu is mentioned in [[Neh.11.7|Nehemiah 11:7]] as one of the leaders of the Benjamites who settled in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. This Sallu is different from the one mentioned in Nehemiah 11:8, as their fathers' names are different \(Meshullam vs. Joed\). The list in Nehemiah 11 records the names of the people who volunteered to live in Jerusalem, which was in need of repopulation and rebuilding after the return from exile \(Nehemiah 11:1-2\). Sallu, the son of Meshullam, is described as a leader among the Benjamites who resided in Jerusalem. No further details are provided about his specific role or contributions to the community. The resettlement of Jerusalem by people from various tribes, including Benjamin, was an important step in the restoration of Jewish life and worship in the city following the exile.
