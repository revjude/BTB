Ammah is mentioned in [[2Sam.2.24|2 Samuel 2:24]] as a hill located near Giah, on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon. The context is the pursuit of Abner, the commander of Saul's army, by Joab and Abishai, who were commanders in David's army. After a battle at Gibeon, Abner and his men fled, with Joab and Abishai in pursuit. 

The verse states that Joab and Abishai reached the hill of Ammah as the sun was setting. The exact location of Ammah is not specified, but it was likely situated in the region of Gibeon, a short distance northwest of Jerusalem. The hill of Ammah may have been a prominent landmark or a strategic vantage point in the area. 

Apart from this single mention in the narrative of the conflict between David's and Saul's forces, no other information about Ammah is provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in the text serves to provide a geographical reference point for the pursuit and to emphasize the distance covered by Joab and Abishai in their attempt to capture Abner.
