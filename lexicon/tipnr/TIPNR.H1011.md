Beth-biri is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[1Chr.4.31|1 Chronicles 4:31]], as part of a list of towns allotted to the tribe of Simeon. The verse states that Beth-biri, along with several other towns, belonged to Simeon until the reign of David. 

The name Beth-biri means "house of my creation" or "house of my pasture" in Hebrew. In the parallel list of Simeon's towns found in Joshua 19:4, the name Bethul appears instead of Beth-biri. This suggests that Beth-biri may have been an alternate name for Bethul or that the town's name changed over time. 

The exact location of Beth-biri is not specified in the Bible, but it was within the territory of Simeon, which was located in the southern part of Canaan, within the larger allotment of the tribe of Judah. Simeon's territory was eventually absorbed into Judah, as the tribe's population decreased over time.
