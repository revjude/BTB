Sheba, mentioned in [[Gen.25.3|Genesis 25:3]] and [[1Chr.1.32|1 Chronicles 1:32]], was one of the sons of Jokshan, who was a son of Abraham through his wife Keturah. After Sarah's death, Abraham took Keturah as his wife and had several children with her. These children, including Jokshan and his sons Sheba and Dedan, are associated with the peoples and tribes of northern Arabia and the surrounding regions. The mention of Sheba as a descendant of Abraham through Keturah indicates the spread of Abraham's lineage beyond the primary line of Isaac and Israel \(or 'Jacob'\). The Sheba mentioned in this context is distinct from the Sheba who was a descendant of Cush \(Genesis 10:7\) and the Sheba who was a descendant of Joktan \(Genesis 10:28\). The multiple individuals named Sheba in the biblical record suggest the prominence and influence of the Arabian tribes and kingdoms in the ancient Near East, particularly in the context of trade and commerce.
