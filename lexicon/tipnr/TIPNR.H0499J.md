Eleazar, mentioned in [[1Chr.23.21|1 Chronicles 23:21]]-22 and 24:28, was the son of Mahli, who was a descendant of Levi through Merari. Eleazar had no sons, only daughters. As a result, his daughters married their cousins on their father's side, the sons of Kish. This arrangement allowed Eleazar's lineage to continue through his daughters.
