Cyrene was an important city in ancient Libya, located in present-day Libya. In the New Testament, Cyrene is mentioned in connection with several individuals who played a role in the life of Jesus and the early Christian church. 

Simon of Cyrene, who was compelled by Roman soldiers to carry Jesus' cross on the way to His crucifixion, is mentioned in [[Matt.27.32|Matthew 27:32]], [[Mark.15.21|Mark 15:21]], and [[Luke.23.26|Luke 23:26]]. Mark's Gospel identifies Simon as the father of Alexander and Rufus, suggesting that these men may have been known to the early Christian community. 

In Acts 2:10, Cyrenians are listed among the people present in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples. Some of these Cyrenian Jews, along with those from Cyprus, were among the first to preach the gospel to the Gentiles in Antioch \(Acts 11:20\). 

Lucius of Cyrene is mentioned as one of the prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch who ministered to the Lord and fasted, leading to the commissioning of Barnabas and Saul \(Paul\) for their first missionary journey \(Acts 13:1\). 

In Acts 6:9, Cyrenian Jews are mentioned as part of the Synagogue of the Freedmen, which disputed with Stephen, the first Christian martyr. 

These references to Cyrene in the New Testament highlight the city's significance as a center of Jewish diaspora and its contribution to the spread of early Christianity, particularly in the evangelization of Gentiles.
