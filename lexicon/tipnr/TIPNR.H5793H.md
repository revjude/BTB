Uthai was one of the exiles who returned to Jerusalem from Babylon with Ezra the scribe. He, along with Zabbud, is recorded as leading a group of 70 males of the descendants of Bigvai in this return journey. This took place during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia, who commissioned Ezra to lead a group back to Judah to reestablish worship and law according to the Torah. Uthai was part of this important group helping to restore Jewish life in Jerusalem after the exile.
