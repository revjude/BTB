Tema is mentioned in several Old Testament passages as an Arabian city and tribe known for its caravans and trade. In [[Job.6.19|Job 6:19]], the caravans of Tema are described as eagerly seeking water in the desert, highlighting the challenges of travel and commerce in the arid region. [[Isa.21.14|Isaiah 21:14]] portrays the inhabitants of Tema offering assistance to fugitives and providing them with bread and water, suggesting a hospitable nature. [[Jer.25.23|Jeremiah 25:23]] lists Tema among the Arabian tribes and kingdoms that would face God's judgment and be made to drink the cup of His wrath. The exact location of Tema is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula, along the trade routes connecting Arabia with Mesopotamia and the Levant. The Tema oasis was a significant stopover for caravans, providing water and provisions for travelers. The tribe of Tema was likely involved in facilitating trade and offering protection to merchant caravans passing through their territory. The biblical references to Tema underscore the importance of Arabian trade and the interactions between the peoples of the Near East in ancient times.
