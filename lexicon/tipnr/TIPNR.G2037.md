Erastus was a companion of the apostle Paul, mentioned in several New Testament passages. He was sent by Paul, along with Timothy, from Ephesus to Macedonia \(Acts 19:22\). In his letter to the Romans, Paul mentions that Erastus, the city treasurer, sends his greetings \([[Rom.16.23|Romans 16:23]]\), indicating that he held an important position in Corinth. Later, in his second letter to Timothy, Paul writes that Erastus stayed in Corinth \([[2Tim.4.20|2 Timothy 4:20]]\). These references suggest that Erastus was a trusted associate of Paul and played a significant role in the early church.
