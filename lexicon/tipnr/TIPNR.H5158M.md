The Brook of Egypt, also known as Shihor, was a waterway that marked the southwestern boundary of the Promised Land. It is mentioned in several passages describing the extent of the Israelite territory \([[Num.34.5|Numbers 34:5]]; [[Josh.15.4|Joshua 15:4]], 47; [[1Kgs.8.65|1 Kings 8:65]]; [[2Chr.7.8|2 Chronicles 7:8]]; [[Ezek.47.19|Ezekiel 47:19]]; 48:28\). The Brook of Egypt is generally identified with the Wadi el-Arish, a seasonal stream that flows into the Mediterranean Sea near the modern border between Israel and Egypt. 

In [[Josh.13.3|Joshua 13:3]], Shihor is described as being "east of Egypt," suggesting that it was a separate body of water from the Nile River. However, in [[Isa.23.3|Isaiah 23:3]], Shihor seems to be associated with the Nile, possibly referring to one of its eastern branches. The Brook of Egypt served not only as a geographical boundary but also as a symbol of the extent of God's promise to Israel and the limit of their conquest. During the reign of King Josiah, the Brook of Egypt was mentioned as the southern limit of Judah's territory \(2 Kings 24:7\).
