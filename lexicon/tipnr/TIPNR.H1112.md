Belshazzar is a prominent figure in the book of Daniel, mentioned in chapters 5, 7, and 8. He is introduced as the king of Babylon and the son of Nebuchadnezzar \([[Dan.5.1|Daniel 5:1]], 22\), although historical records identify him as the son of Nabonidus, the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Belshazzar is known for holding a great feast, during which he and his nobles drank from the sacred vessels taken from the temple in Jerusalem \([[Dan.5.1|Daniel 5:1]]-4\). During this feast, a mysterious hand appeared and wrote a message on the wall, which only Daniel could interpret \(Daniel 5:5-28\). The message foretold the end of Belshazzar's kingdom, and that very night, Belshazzar was slain, and Darius the Mede took over the kingdom \([[Dan.5.30|Daniel 5:30]]-31\). Belshazzar is also mentioned in Daniel's visions \([[Dan.7.1|Daniel 7:1]]; 8:1\), providing a historical context for the prophetic revelations. Belshazzar's reign and his sudden downfall serve as a powerful reminder of God's sovereignty over earthly kingdoms and the consequences of disregarding God's authority.
