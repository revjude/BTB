Ehud was a left-handed Benjamite who served as a judge and deliverer of Israel during the period of the judges. His story is primarily recorded in Judges 3:12-30, with brief mentions in [[Judg.4.1|Judges 4:1]] and [[1Chr.8.6|1 Chronicles 8:6]]. 

After the Israelites did evil in the sight of the Lord, God allowed Eglon, the king of Moab, to conquer and oppress them for eighteen years. When the Israelites cried out to the Lord for deliverance, God raised up Ehud as their deliverer \(Judges 3:12-15\). 

Ehud is described as a left-handed man, which is significant because it allowed him to conceal a double-edged sword on his right thigh without arousing suspicion. He was sent to deliver tribute to King Eglon, who is portrayed as a very fat man \([[Judg.3.16|Judges 3:16]]-17\). 

After presenting the tribute, Ehud returned to Eglon, claiming to have a secret message for him. When Eglon dismissed his attendants, Ehud approached him and declared, "I have a message from God for you" \(Judges 3:18-20\). He then drew his concealed sword with his left hand and thrust it into Eglon's belly, killing him \([[Judg.3.21|Judges 3:21]]-22\). 

Ehud escaped, locking the doors of the upper room behind him. He then rallied the Israelites, who seized the fords of the Jordan leading to Moab and struck down about 10,000 Moabites. This victory brought peace to the land for eighty years \([[Judg.3.23|Judges 3:23]]-30\).
