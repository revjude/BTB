- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Zech.6.10|Zec.6.10]]; 
- referred to as Josiah<[[H2977H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>אש</span>ִׁ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ָּ֫<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>הו</span>ּ\), or Hen<[[H2581]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ח</span>ֵ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ן</span>\); 
- a son of Zephaniah<[[H6846I]]>.

Josiah, also known as Hen, is mentioned in [[Zech.6.10|Zechariah 6:10]] and 6:14 in the context of a symbolic act during the prophet Zechariah's ministry. Zechariah was instructed to take silver and gold from the returned exiles, specifically from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, who had come from Babylon \([[Zech.6.10|Zechariah 6:10]]\). 

Josiah \(or Hen\) is mentioned as the son of Zephaniah, in whose house the silver and gold were to be stored until they were used to make a crown \([[Zech.6.10|Zechariah 6:10]], 14\). The crown was then to be placed on the head of Joshua, the high priest, as a symbol of the coming "Branch," a messianic figure who would build the temple and rule as both priest and king \(Zechariah 6:11-13\). 

The name "Josiah" is used in verse 10, while "Hen" is used in verse 14. This variation may reflect different traditions or translations of the name.
