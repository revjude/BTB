Mattaniah was a Levite who lived during the time of Nehemiah, after the Babylonian exile. He served as a singer and gatekeeper in the temple. In the genealogies of the Levites, Mattaniah is listed as a descendant of Asaph, one of the chief musicians appointed by David \([[1Chr.9.15|1 Chronicles 9:15]]\). During the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, Mattaniah was among the Levites who led the people in praise and thanksgiving to God \([[Neh.11.17|Nehemiah 11:17]]; 12:8, 25\). His role as a singer and gatekeeper highlights the importance of worship and service in the restored community of Israel.
