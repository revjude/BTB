The Ephraim Gate is mentioned in the Book of Nehemiah as one of the gates in Jerusalem's wall that was rebuilt and dedicated during Nehemiah's governorship \([[Neh.8.16|Nehemiah 8:16]]; 12:39\). After the Babylonian exile, Nehemiah led the effort to reconstruct the city walls and gates, which had been destroyed by the Babylonians. 

In [[Neh.8.16|Nehemiah 8:16]], the Ephraim Gate is mentioned as one of the locations where the people gathered to hear Ezra read the Book of the Law during the Feast of Tabernacles. The public reading of the Law was an important event in the spiritual renewal of the Jewish community after their return from exile. 

[[Neh.12.39|Nehemiah 12:39]] describes a dedication ceremony for the rebuilt wall, during which two processions of singers and musicians marched along the top of the wall in opposite directions, meeting at the Ephraim Gate before proceeding to the Temple. 

The Ephraim Gate's location is not specified, but it was likely on the north side of the city, facing toward the territory of Ephraim. Its inclusion in these events highlights its significance as a public gathering place and a symbol of Jerusalem's restoration and spiritual renewal under Nehemiah's leadership.
