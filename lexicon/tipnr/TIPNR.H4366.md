Michmethath is mentioned twice in the Bible as a place situated on the border between the territories allocated to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh \([[Josh.16.6|Joshua 16:6]]; 17:7\). In [[Josh.16.6|Joshua 16:6]], it is described as being east of Taanath-shiloh and is one of the points defining the border of Ephraim. In [[Josh.17.7|Joshua 17:7]], Michmethath is said to be south of Shechem and is part of the border description of Manasseh. The exact location of Michmethath is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the hill country of central Canaan.
