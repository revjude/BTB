Mehir is mentioned in the genealogy of Judah, specifically as the son of Chelub \([[1Chr.4.11|1 Chronicles 4:11]]\). No further information is provided about Mehir or his descendants in the biblical text. The genealogies in 1 Chronicles often serve to establish the lineage and inheritance rights of prominent families in Israel, particularly in the context of the post-exilic period when these records were compiled. However, due to the lack of additional details, Mehir's role and significance in the family of Judah remain unknown.
