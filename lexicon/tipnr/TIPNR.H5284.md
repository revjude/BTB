<small>*Group • The people group of Zophar, Job's friend.*</small>

People from Naamath\(?\)

The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Naamathites</span> were the people group to which Zophar, one of Job's three friends, belonged.
- People from Naamath\(?\), first mentioned at [[Job.2.11|Job.2.11]]; 
- only referred to as Naamathites **<big>[[H5284|נַעֲמָתִי]]</big>**.

The Naamathites are mentioned in the Book of Job as the people group to which Zophar, one of Job's three friends, belonged \([[Job.2.11|Job 2:11]]; 11:1; 20:1; 42:9\). Zophar is described as "the Naamathite," indicating his association with this group. 

The Naamathites are not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, and little is known about their specific location, history, or culture. The name "Naamathite" suggests a connection to a place called Naamah, but the exact location of this place is uncertain. 

In the Book of Job, Zophar, along with Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite, come to comfort Job after hearing of his afflictions. The three friends engage in a series of dialogues with Job, attempting to explain his suffering and offering their perspectives on God's justice and the reasons for Job's trials. 

Zophar's speeches, as a representative of the Naamathites, emphasize the idea that suffering is a consequence of sin and that Job must have committed some wrongdoing to deserve his misfortune. Zophar urges Job to repent and seek God's forgiveness \([[Job.11.1|Job 11:1]]3-20\).
