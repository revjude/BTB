Shimri is mentioned in [[2Chr.29.13|2 Chronicles 29:13]] as one of the Levites who participated in the purification of the temple during the reign of King Hezekiah. He is listed alongside other Levites from the families of Elizaphan and Asaph who responded to Hezekiah's call to consecrate themselves and cleanse the temple. The purification process involved removing all the unclean items from the temple and restoring proper worship practices. As a Levite, Shimri would have had specific duties related to the temple service and played a role in this important religious reform.
