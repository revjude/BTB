Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Blastus</span>, Herod's chamberlain, was persuaded by the people of Tyre and Sidon to help them gain the king's favor.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Esth.1.10|Act.12.20]]; 
- only referred to as Blastus **<big>[[G0986|Βλάστος]]</big>**.

Blastus was the chamberlain of King Herod Agrippa I, who ruled over Judea from 41 to 44 AD \(Acts 12:20\). The people of Tyre and Sidon, two coastal cities in modern-day Lebanon, had offended Herod, and their region depended on the king's country for food. To regain Herod's favor, they persuaded Blastus to help them secure a reconciliation with the king. Blastus' position as chamberlain, or personal attendant, to the king gave him significant influence and access to the monarch. The fact that the people of Tyre and Sidon sought Blastus' assistance indicates his importance in the royal court and his potential role as an intermediary between the king and his subjects. This brief mention of Blastus in the book of Acts provides insight into the political dynamics and the role of royal officials in the early days of the Christian church.
