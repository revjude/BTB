Jahleel was one of the sons of Zebulun and a grandson of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) \(Gen. 46:14\). He is mentioned in the genealogy of Jacob's descendants who went to Egypt during the time of Joseph. Later, in the census taken in the wilderness, Jahleel is listed as one of the clans of Zebulun \(Num. 26:26\). The Jahleelites, his descendants, are counted among the clans of Zebulun. Apart from these two mentions in the genealogies and census, no other details about Jahleel's life or specific role are provided in the Bible. His inclusion in these lists highlights his place in the lineage of Zebulun and his status as a clan leader within the tribe.
