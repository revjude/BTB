The context of the passage is the listing of David's officials and advisors, with a focus on those who served in key positions during his reign. Jehoiada's appointment as a counselor to the king suggests that he was a wise and trusted individual, capable of providing guidance and support to David. The fact that he succeeded Ahithophel, who had been a renowned counselor before his betrayal and death, further underscores the importance of Jehoiada's role. The mention of Benaiah as Jehoiada's father provides a genealogical link and helps to establish Jehoiada's identity.
