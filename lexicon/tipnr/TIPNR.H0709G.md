Argob was a region located in the kingdom of Bashan, east of the Jordan River, in what is now modern-day Syria. It is mentioned in the Bible in connection with the Israelites' conquest of the Promised Land under the leadership of Moses and Joshua. 

In Deuteronomy 3:4, Argob is described as a region containing sixty fortified cities, all of which were captured by the Israelites during their conquest of Og, the king of Bashan. These cities were noted for their high walls, gates, and bars, indicating their strong defensive capabilities \(Deuteronomy 3:5\). 

The region of Argob was allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh as part of their inheritance in the Promised Land \(Deuteronomy 3:13\). Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took possession of Argob and named it Havvoth-jair, which means "the towns of Jair" \(Deuteronomy 3:14\). 

During the reign of King Solomon, Argob was included in the territory governed by one of his twelve officers, who was responsible for providing provisions for the king and his household \([[1Kgs.4.13|1 Kings 4:13]]\). 

The biblical references to Argob highlight its significance as a fortified and strategically important region in the Transjordan area. The conquest of Argob by the Israelites demonstrates their military success under divine guidance and the fulfillment of God's promise to give them the land. The region's inclusion in the allotment of the tribes and its mention during Solomon's reign underscore its ongoing importance in the history of Israel.
