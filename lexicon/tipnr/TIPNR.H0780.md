Ararat is a mountain range located in the region of Armenia, in present-day eastern Turkey. It is most famously known as the place where Noah's ark came to rest after the great flood, as recorded in [[Gen.8.4|Genesis 8:4]]. The specific mountain is often identified as Mount Ararat, which consists of two peaks: Greater Ararat and Lesser Ararat. 

In the Bible, Ararat is also mentioned in the context of historical events. In [[2Kgs.19.37|2 Kings 19:37]] and [[Isa.37.38|Isaiah 37:38]], it is recorded that Adrammelech and Sharezer, the sons of Sennacherib, king of Assyria, fled to the land of Ararat after assassinating their father. This suggests that Ararat was a recognized geographical and political entity during the time of the Assyrian Empire. 

Furthermore, in [[Jer.51.27|Jeremiah 51:27]], Ararat is mentioned alongside Minni and Ashkenaz as kingdoms summoned to rise up against Babylon. This prophetic passage foretells the fall of Babylon and the role that the kingdoms of Ararat and its allies would play in this event. 

The biblical references to Ararat highlight its significance as a geographical landmark and its association with important events in biblical history, most notably the landing of Noah's ark and the preservation of life after the flood. The mention of Ararat in the context of political alliances and conflicts also demonstrates its relevance in the geopolitical landscape of the ancient Near East.
