- A man from the tribe of Issachar living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, only mentioned at [[1Chr.7.2|1Ch.7.2]]; 
- only referred to as Ibsam **<big>[[H3005|יִבְשָׂם]]</big>**; 
-  son of Tola **<big>[[H8439|תּוֹלָע]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Uzzi **<big>[[H5813|עֻזִּי]]</big>**, Rephaiah **<big>[[H7509|רְפָיָה]]</big>**, Jeriel **<big>[[H3400|יְרִיאֵל]]</big>**, Jahmai **<big>[[H3181|יַחְמַי]]</big>** and Shemuel **<big>[[H8050|שְׁמוּאֵל]]</big>**.

Ibsam is mentioned in [[1Chr.7.2|1 Chronicles 7:2]] as one of the sons of Tola, who was a son of Issachar. Issachar was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, and the genealogy in 1 Chronicles 7 lists the descendants of this tribe. 

Ibsam is listed along with his brothers Uzzi, Rephaiah, Jeriel, Jahmai, Jibsam, and Shemuel. These seven individuals are described as "mighty men of valor" and heads of their fathers' houses. This suggests that Ibsam and his brothers were influential leaders within the tribe of Issachar. 

The genealogical record in 1 Chronicles 7 emphasizes the importance of family lineage and tribal identity in ancient Israelite society. The mention of Ibsam and his brothers as mighty men of valor also highlights their military prowess and leadership roles within the tribe. 

Apart from this brief mention in the genealogy, no other specific details are provided about Ibsam's life or achievements in the Bible. However, his inclusion in the record attests to his significance as a member of the tribe of Issachar and his position as a head of his father's house.
