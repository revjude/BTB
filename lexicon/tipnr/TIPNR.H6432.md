People from Pelath\(?\)

The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Pelethites</span>, along with the Cherethites, were an elite military unit loyal to King David.
- People from Pelath\(?\), first mentioned at [[2Sam.8.18|2Sa.8.18]]; 
- only referred to as Pelethites **<big>[[H6432|פְּלֵתִי]]</big>**.

The Pelethites were an elite military unit that served as part of King David's personal guard and army, often mentioned alongside the Cherethites \([[2Sam.8.18|2 Samuel 8:18]]; 15:18; 20:7,23; [[1Kgs.1.38|1 Kings 1:38]],44; [[1Chr.18.17|1 Chronicles 18:17]]\). They were known for their loyalty to David and played a significant role in supporting him during his reign. The Pelethites and Cherethites were likely foreign mercenaries, possibly of Philistine origin, who had pledged their allegiance to David. They were involved in key events, such as helping David quell Absalom's rebellion \([[2Sam.15.18|2 Samuel 15:18]]\) and supporting Solomon's claim to the throne \([[1Kgs.1.38|1 Kings 1:38]],44\). The presence of these elite warriors demonstrates David's military strength and the diversity of his army.
