Nethaniah was a Levite who lived during the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah. He was one of the Levites that Jehoshaphat sent out to teach the Book of the Law in all the towns of Judah \([[2Chr.17.8|2 Chronicles 17:8]]\). As a Levite, teaching the people God's laws would have been one of his key roles. This mission by Jehoshaphat was part of his reforms to turn the people back to God.
