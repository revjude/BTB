Shallum, mentioned in [[2Kgs.22.14|2 Kings 22:14]] and [[2Chr.34.22|2 Chronicles 34:22]], was the husband of Huldah, a prophetess who lived in Jerusalem during the reign of King Josiah. He is described as the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, and is identified as the keeper of the wardrobe. This position likely involved overseeing the royal garments and possibly managing the king's household. When King Josiah ordered the high priest Hilkiah to inquire of the Lord concerning the words of the Book of the Law that had been found, Hilkiah and the king's servants sought out Huldah for her prophetic insight. Huldah delivered a message from God, confirming the authenticity of the book and foretelling the judgment that would come upon Judah for their disobedience. Shallum's connection to Huldah and his role in the royal household suggest that he was a respected figure in Jerusalem during this time of religious reform.
