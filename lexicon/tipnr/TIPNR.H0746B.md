- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Dan.2.14|Dan.2.14]]; 
- only referred to as Arioch **<big>[[H0746|אֲרְיוֹךְ]]</big>**.

Arioch is mentioned in the book of Daniel as the captain of King Nebuchadnezzar's guard during the time of the Babylonian exile. In Daniel 2, Nebuchadnezzar had a troubling dream and demanded that his wise men not only interpret the dream but also tell him what he had dreamed. When they were unable to do so, the king ordered Arioch to execute all the wise men of Babylon. 

Daniel, a young Jewish exile, requested time from Arioch to interpret the king's dream. Arioch brought Daniel before Nebuchadnezzar, and Daniel was able to reveal both the content of the dream and its interpretation, which concerned the rise and fall of future kingdoms and the ultimate establishment of God's eternal kingdom. 

Arioch's role in this narrative highlights the danger faced by Daniel and his friends, as well as the power and authority of the Babylonian king. Arioch's willingness to grant Daniel's request and bring him before Nebuchadnezzar also demonstrates the respect and trust that Daniel had earned in the Babylonian court, even as a young exile.
