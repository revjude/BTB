Joseph was the husband of Mary and the earthly father of Jesus Christ. He was a descendant of David \([[Matt.1.16|Matthew 1:16]], 20; [[Luke.1.27|Luke 1:27]]; 2:4\) and lived in Nazareth \([[Luke.2.4|Luke 2:4]]\). Joseph was betrothed to Mary when she was found to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit \([[Matt.1.18|Matthew 1:18]]; [[Luke.1.27|Luke 1:27]]\). Being a righteous man, he planned to divorce her quietly, but an angel appeared to him in a dream, telling him to take Mary as his wife and name the child Jesus \([[Matt.1.19|Matthew 1:19]]-21, 24-25\). Joseph obeyed and took care of Mary and Jesus. He was present at Jesus' birth in Bethlehem \([[Luke.2.4|Luke 2:4]]-7, 16\) and later took his family to Egypt to escape Herod's persecution \([[Matt.2.13|Matthew 2:13]]-15, 19-23\). Joseph is last mentioned in the Gospels when Jesus was 12 years old, and the family visited Jerusalem for the Passover \([[Luke.2.4|Luke 2:4]]1-51\). He is referred to as Jesus' father \([[Luke.2.33|Luke 2:33]], 48; 4:22; [[John.1.45|John 1:45]]; 6:42\) and was a carpenter by trade \([[Matt.13.55|Matthew 13:55]]\). Joseph is not mentioned during Jesus' adult ministry, suggesting he may have died before that time.
