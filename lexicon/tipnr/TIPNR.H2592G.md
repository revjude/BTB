Hanniel, the son of Ephod, is mentioned in [[Num.34.23|Numbers 34:23]] as the leader of the tribe of Manasseh during the allotment of the Promised Land. After the Israelites had conquered the land of Canaan under the leadership of Joshua, the land was divided among the tribes of Israel. To ensure a fair distribution, leaders from each tribe were appointed to oversee the process. Hanniel was chosen to represent the tribe of Manasseh, one of the largest tribes, which received its inheritance on both sides of the Jordan River \(Joshua 13:29-31\). The mention of Hanniel in this context highlights the importance of the land allotment process and the role of tribal leaders in ensuring a just distribution.
