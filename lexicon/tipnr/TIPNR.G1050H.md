Gaius of Derbe is mentioned in Acts 20:4 as one of the men who accompanied Paul on his journey from Greece to Jerusalem. After spending three months in Greece, Paul decided to return through Macedonia due to a plot against him by the Jews. He was accompanied by Sopater of Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus of Thessalonica, Gaius of Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia. These men went ahead and waited for Paul and his companions at Troas. The mention of Gaius and the others demonstrates the unity and support among the early Christians from different regions as they worked together to spread the gospel.
