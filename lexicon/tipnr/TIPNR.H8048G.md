Shammah, mentioned in [[Gen.36.13|Genesis 36:13]],17 and [[1Chr.1.37|1 Chronicles 1:37]], was a descendant of Esau, the twin brother of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\). He was the son of Reuel, who was one of Esau's sons. Shammah is listed among the chiefs of Edom, indicating that he held a position of authority and leadership within the Edomite tribe. The Edomites were descendants of Esau who settled in the region southeast of Judah. The text does not provide any specific details about Shammah's life or his role as a chief. However, his inclusion in the genealogical record of Esau's descendants highlights the importance of family lineage and the development of tribal structures in the ancient Near East. The mention of Shammah as a chief suggests that he played a significant role in the political and social organization of the Edomites.
