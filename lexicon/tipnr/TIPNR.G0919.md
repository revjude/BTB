<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Bar-jesus</span>, also known as Elymas, was a Jewish sorcerer who tried to hinder Paul and Barnabas' ministry.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[1Chr.3.22|Act.13.6]]; 
- referred to as Bar-jesus **<big>[[G0919|Βαριησοῦς]]</big>**, or Elymas **<big>[[G1681|Ἐλύμας]]</big>**.

Bar-Jesus, also called Elymas, was a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet encountered by Paul and Barnabas during their missionary journey on the island of Cyprus \(Acts 13:6-12\). He was associated with Sergius Paulus, the proconsul of the island, who had summoned Paul and Barnabas to hear the word of God. However, Elymas opposed the apostles and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith. Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, rebuked Elymas for his deceit and obstruction of the truth, declaring that he would be temporarily blinded. Immediately, Elymas lost his sight, and the proconsul, seeing what had happened, believed and was astonished at the teaching about the Lord. The name "Elymas" is said to mean "magician" or "sorcerer," while "Bar-Jesus" means "son of Jesus" or "son of Joshua." This incident demonstrates the power of the gospel over spiritual opposition and the consequences of resisting God's message.
