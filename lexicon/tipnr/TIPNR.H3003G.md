Jabesh, also known as Jabesh-gilead, was a town located in the region of Gilead, east of the Jordan River. The city is first mentioned in the book of Judges, where the inhabitants refused to join the Israelites in fighting against the tribe of Benjamin \([[Judg.21.8|Judges 21:8]]-14\). As a result, the town was attacked, and the virgins of Jabesh were given as wives to the surviving Benjamites. Later, during the reign of King Saul, the Ammonites besieged Jabesh, and Saul came to their rescue, defeating the Ammonites and solidifying his position as king \(1 Samuel 11:1-11\). After Saul's death, the men of Jabesh bravely retrieved the bodies of Saul and his sons from the Philistines and buried them \([[1Sam.31.11|1 Samuel 31:11]]-13; [[1Chr.10.11|1 Chronicles 10:11]]-12\). David later praised the men of Jabesh for their loyalty and kindness to Saul \([[2Sam.2.4|2 Samuel 2:4]]-7\). The town's location is uncertain, but it was likely situated in northern Gilead, possibly near modern-day Wadi Yabis in Jordan.
