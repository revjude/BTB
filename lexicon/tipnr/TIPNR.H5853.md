Ataroth-addar was a town situated on the border between the tribal territories of Ephraim and Benjamin, as recorded in the book of Joshua. In [[Josh.16.5|Joshua 16:5]], Ataroth-addar is mentioned as part of the description of Ephraim's territory, specifically its southern border. The town is listed along with Beth-horon as marking the extent of Ephraim's inheritance. 

In [[Josh.18.13|Joshua 18:13]], Ataroth-addar appears again in the delineation of Benjamin's territory. The verse states that the border extended from there to Ataroth-addar, near the hill south of Lower Beth-horon. This description places Ataroth-addar in the vicinity of Beth-horon, a strategically important town in the western foothills of the central hill country. 

The name Ataroth-addar likely combines two elements: "Ataroth," meaning "crowns" or "wreaths," and "Addar," which may be a personal name or a descriptive term. The exact location of Ataroth-addar is not known with certainty, but its repeated mention in the boundary descriptions underscores its significance as a border town between Ephraim and Benjamin. 

Apart from its role in demarcating tribal territories, no other information about Ataroth-addar is provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in the boundary lists of Joshua highlights the importance of establishing clear territorial divisions among the tribes of Israel as they settled in the Promised Land.
