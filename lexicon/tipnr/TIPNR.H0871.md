Atharim is mentioned in [[Num.21.1|Numbers 21:1]] as the place where the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that the Israelites were coming along the road to Atharim. Upon hearing this news, the king attacked Israel and took some of them captive. 

The exact location of Atharim is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the northern part of the Negev desert, south of Canaan. The name Atharim may refer to a specific road or route that the Israelites were traveling on during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. 

The incident at Atharim occurred after the Israelites had left Mount Hor and were continuing their journey around the land of Edom. The attack by the Canaanite king of Arad was a significant challenge for the Israelites, as it threatened their progress and security in the region. 

In response to this attack, the Israelites made a vow to the Lord, promising to utterly destroy the Canaanite cities if God would deliver them into their hands. God heard their plea and gave them victory over the Canaanites, leading to the destruction of their cities and the renaming of the place as Hormah, meaning "destruction" \(Numbers 21:2-3\). 

The event at Atharim highlights the ongoing challenges and conflicts the Israelites faced during their wilderness journey, as well as their dependence on God's protection and intervention in the face of enemy attacks. It also foreshadows the future conquest of Canaan under Joshua's leadership.
