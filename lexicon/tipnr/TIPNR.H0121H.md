Adam is mentioned in [[Josh.3.16|Joshua 3:16]] as a city near the Jordan River, in connection with the miraculous crossing of the Israelites into the Promised Land. When the priests bearing the Ark of the Covenant stepped into the Jordan, the river stopped flowing and piled up in a heap a great distance away at Adam, allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground. The exact location of Adam is uncertain, but it is described as being beside Zarethan, which is believed to be near the confluence of the Jabbok and Jordan Rivers, roughly 30 miles \(48 km\) north of Jericho. The damming of the Jordan at Adam demonstrates God's power and faithfulness in enabling Israel to enter the Promised Land.
