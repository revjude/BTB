<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Rehum</span> was a Persian official who wrote to King Artaxerxes, attempting to stop the rebuilding of Jerusalem.
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.4.8|Ezr.4.8]]; 
- only referred to as Rehum<[[H7348B]]> \(Aramiac <span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>חו</span>ּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ם</span>\).

Rehum is mentioned in the book of Ezra as a high-ranking Persian official who held the title of "commander" \([[Ezra.4.8|Ezra 4:8]], 9, 17, 23\). When the enemies of the Jews learned that they had begun rebuilding the temple and the city walls of Jerusalem, they wrote a letter to King Artaxerxes to persuade him to stop the work \(Ezra 4:7-16\). Rehum was one of the officials who signed this letter, along with Shimshai the scribe and others \([[Ezra.4.9|Ezra 4:9]]\). In the letter, they accused the Jews of rebuilding a rebellious and wicked city that had a history of causing trouble for kings \(Ezra 4:12-16\). As a result, Artaxerxes ordered the work to be stopped until further notice \([[Ezra.4.17|Ezra 4:17]]-22\). Rehum and his associates then went to Jerusalem and forcibly made the Jews stop building \([[Ezra.4.23|Ezra 4:23]]\). This opposition delayed the completion of the temple and the city walls until the reign of King Darius \(Ezra 4:24\). Rehum's actions demonstrate the political challenges faced by the Jews as they sought to rebuild Jerusalem after returning from Babylonian exile.
