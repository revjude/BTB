Johanan, the son of Kareah, was a prominent Judean military leader who was active in the aftermath of the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in 586 BC. After the Babylonians appointed Gedaliah as governor over the remnant of Judah, Johanan and other army officers came to him at Mizpah \([[2Kgs.25.23|2Ki.25.23]]; [[Jer.40.8|Jer.40.8]]\). When Ishmael, a member of the royal family, assassinated Gedaliah and killed many others, Johanan pursued him and rescued the captives Ishmael had taken \([[Jer.41.11|Jer.41.11]]-16\). 

Following these events, Johanan and the other leaders sought the advice of the prophet Jeremiah, asking him to pray for guidance \([[Jer.42.1|Jer.42.1]]-3\). However, when Jeremiah conveyed God's message that they should remain in the land and not flee to Egypt, Johanan and the others refused to obey \([[Jer.43.2|Jer.43.2]]-4\). Instead, they took the remnant of Judah, including Jeremiah, and went to Egypt \([[Jer.43.5|Jer.43.5]]-7\). 

Johanan's story highlights the complex political situation in Judah after the Babylonian conquest and the challenges faced by those who remained in the land. While he initially seemed to support Gedaliah and sought Jeremiah's guidance, his ultimate refusal to obey God's word led him and the remnant of Judah into further disobedience and exile.
