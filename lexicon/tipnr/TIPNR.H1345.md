Geuel, the son of Machi, is mentioned in [[Num.13.15|Numbers 13:15]] as the representative of the tribe of Gad among the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan. After the Israelites had left Egypt and arrived at the wilderness of Paran, God instructed Moses to send one man from each of the twelve tribes to scout out the Promised Land \(Numbers 13:1-2\). These twelve spies were chosen from among the leaders of their respective tribes \(Numbers 13:3\). Geuel was selected to represent the tribe of Gad. The spies were tasked with assessing the land, its inhabitants, and its resources \(Numbers 13:17-20\). After forty days, they returned with a report of a land flowing with milk and honey, but also inhabited by strong peoples \(Numbers 13:25-28\). Ten of the spies, including Geuel, brought back a discouraging report, emphasizing the challenges of conquering the land \(Numbers 13:31-33\). Only Joshua and Caleb, the spies from the tribes of Ephraim and Judah, respectively, gave a positive report and encouraged the people to trust in God's promise \(Numbers 14:6-9\). As a result of the people's unbelief and rebellion, God declared that the generation who had witnessed the Exodus would not enter the Promised Land, except for Joshua and Caleb \(Numbers 14:20-35\). Geuel's role in this incident highlights the importance of faith and obedience in the face of challenges and the consequences of unbelief and disobedience.
