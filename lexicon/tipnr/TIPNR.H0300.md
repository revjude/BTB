Ahishahar is mentioned briefly in the genealogy of the tribe of Benjamin, recorded in the book of 1 Chronicles. He was one of the sons of Bilhan, who was a descendant of Benjamin through his son Jediael. \(1Ch.7.6,10\) 

The genealogy lists several of Bilhan's sons, including Ahishahar, but does not provide any additional information about their lives or roles within the tribe. The purpose of the genealogy is to trace the lineage of significant Benjamite families and individuals. 

As a member of the tribe of Benjamin, Ahishahar would have been part of the Israelite community, but the biblical text does not record any specific events or contributions associated with him.
