Secacah is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the list of towns allotted to the tribe of Judah in the wilderness region \(Josh. 15:61\). The wilderness of Judah was a barren and sparsely populated area in the eastern part of Judah's territory, bordering the Dead Sea. The exact location of Secacah is unknown, but it was likely situated in this arid region.
