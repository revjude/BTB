Seraiah, mentioned in [[Ezra.2.2|Ezra 2:2]], [[Neh.10.2|Nehemiah 10:2]], and [[Neh.12.1|Nehemiah 12:1]],12, was a priest who returned from the Babylonian exile. He is listed among the priests who came back to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel, the leader of the first group of returning exiles. Seraiah's name appears in the list of men who sealed the covenant under Nehemiah's leadership \([[Neh.10.2|Nehemiah 10:2]]\), indicating his involvement in the spiritual renewal of the community. He is also mentioned in the list of priests who settled in Jerusalem during the time of the high priest Joiakim \([[Neh.12.1|Nehemiah 12:1]],12\). These references suggest that Seraiah played a significant role in the religious life of the post-exilic community, serving as a priest and participating in important events such as the signing of the covenant.
