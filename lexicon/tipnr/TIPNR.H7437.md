Ramath-lehi is mentioned in the Bible in connection with the story of Samson, one of the judges of Israel \(Judg. 15:17\). After Samson's wife was given to another man, he took revenge on the Philistines by burning their crops and vineyards. In retaliation, the Philistines came to arrest Samson, who was staying in Judah. The men of Judah, fearing Philistine reprisal, bound Samson and handed him over to the Philistines. However, when the Philistines came to capture him, the Spirit of the Lord came upon Samson, and he broke free from his bonds. He then found a fresh jawbone of a donkey and used it to strike down a thousand Philistines \(Judg. 15:14-16\). The place where this event occurred was called Ramath-lehi, which means "hill of the jawbone" or "jawbone height" \(Judg. 15:17\). The name served as a reminder of Samson's remarkable feat and God's empowerment in his life. The story of Samson at Ramath-lehi highlights the ongoing conflict between the Israelites and the Philistines during the period of the judges and demonstrates God's power to deliver His people through unlikely means.
