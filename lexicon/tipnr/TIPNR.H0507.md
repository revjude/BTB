Haeleph was a town mentioned in the list of cities and towns allotted to the tribe of Benjamin during the division of the Promised Land. It is listed among the towns in the vicinity of Jerusalem, along with Zelah, Eleph, Jebusi \(Jerusalem\), Gibeah, and Kirjath-jearim \([[Josh.18.28|Joshua 18:28]]\). Apart from this single mention in the book of Joshua, no further information about Haeleph is provided in the Bible. Its exact location and history remain uncertain, as the town is not mentioned in any other biblical accounts or in known extra-biblical sources. The inclusion of Haeleph in the list of Benjamin's towns suggests that it was a settlement of some significance during the time of Joshua and the initial division of the land among the Israelite tribes.
