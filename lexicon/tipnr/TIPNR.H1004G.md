Beth-ashbea is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[1Chr.4.21|1 Chronicles 4:21]], as part of the genealogy of the tribe of Judah. The verse states that the families of the house of Ashbea, who were from Beth-ashbea, were known for their work with fine linen. 

The exact location of Beth-ashbea is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely a town or village within the territory of Judah. The name Beth-ashbea means "house of Ashbea" or "house of the oath" in Hebrew. 

The mention of the families of the house of Ashbea and their fine linen work suggests that Beth-ashbea was known for its textile industry. Fine linen was a valuable commodity in ancient times, often used for clothing, bedding, and religious garments. 

No other details about Beth-ashbea or the families of the house of Ashbea are provided in the Bible. The brief mention in the genealogy of Judah highlights the skills and craftsmanship of the people associated with this place.
