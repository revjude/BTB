Adamah is listed in [[Josh.19.36|Joshua 19:36]] as one of the fortified cities within the territory allotted to the tribe of Naphtali. It is mentioned along with other fortified cities such as Chinnereth, Ramah, and Hazor, suggesting its importance as a defensive stronghold in the region. The exact location of Adamah is unknown, but it was likely situated in the hill country of Upper Galilee, north of the Sea of Galilee. As a fortified city, Adamah would have played a role in protecting Naphtali's territory from enemy incursions.
