Hodiah is mentioned in [[Neh.10.18|Nehemiah 10:18]] as one of the priests who signed the covenant to follow the Law of God during the time of Nehemiah. This covenant was a solemn agreement made by the Israelites to obey God's commandments, separate themselves from the surrounding nations, and support the temple service. 

As a priest, Hodiah would have had specific responsibilities related to the temple worship and the teaching of the Law. By signing the covenant, he publicly demonstrated his commitment to God's Law and his support for the spiritual and social reforms initiated by Nehemiah. 

The participation of priests in the covenant signing was crucial, as they were the religious leaders of the community and were responsible for maintaining the purity of worship and the adherence to God's commandments. Hodiah's involvement in this event highlights his role as a priest and his dedication to the spiritual well-being of the Israelites during this period of rebuilding and renewal.
