Oren was one of the sons of Jerahmeel, a descendant of Judah \([[1Chr.2.25|1 Chronicles 2:25]]\). He is mentioned in the genealogy of Judah, which lists the descendants of Judah's sons and grandsons. Jerahmeel was the son of Hezron, who was the son of Perez, one of Judah's twin sons born to Tamar \(1 Chronicles 2:5, 9\). The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 2 provides insight into the family lines and clans within the tribe of Judah. Oren's mention in this genealogy suggests that he was a significant figure within the Jerahmeelite clan. However, no further details about Oren's life or role are provided in the Bible.
