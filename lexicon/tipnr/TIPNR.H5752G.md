Oded was a prophet who lived during the reign of King Asa of Judah. He was the father of Azariah, another prophet \([[2Chr.15.1|2 Chronicles 15:1]]\). Azariah, inspired by the Spirit of God, delivered a message to King Asa, encouraging him to seek the Lord and reminding him of the consequences of forsaking God \([[2Chr.15.1|2 Chronicles 15:1]]-7\). This prophecy prompted Asa to initiate religious reforms in Judah, removing idols and repairing the altar of the Lord \([[2Chr.15.8|2 Chronicles 15:8]]\). Although Oded himself is not recorded as delivering a prophecy, his role as the father of Azariah suggests that he may have been influential in his son's prophetic ministry.
