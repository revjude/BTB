Elnaam is mentioned in the list of David's mighty men as the father of Jeribai and Joshaviah \([[1Chr.11.46|1Ch.11.46]]\). The mighty men were a group of skilled warriors who demonstrated exceptional valor and loyalty to King David. Elnaam's sons, Jeribai and Joshaviah, were counted among this elite group, indicating their prowess in battle and their dedication to serving the king. The inclusion of Elnaam's name in this context suggests that he was a notable figure, possibly known for his own military achievements or for his role in raising and training his sons to be skilled warriors. However, no further details about Elnaam's life, occupation, or personal characteristics are provided in the Bible. His mention serves primarily to identify the family background of two of David's mighty men.
