Maaseiah was a priest who was found to have married a foreign woman during the time of Ezra \([[Ezra.10.18|Ezr.10.18]]\). After the return of the Jewish exiles from Babylon, Ezra, a priest and scribe, led a religious reform to purify the community and restore adherence to the Law of Moses \(Ezr.7-10\). One of the issues addressed in this reform was the problem of intermarriage with foreign women, which was seen as a violation of God's commandments \(Deut.7.3-4\). Maaseiah was among the priests who had taken foreign wives, and he is listed along with others who pledged to put away their wives and offer a ram as a guilt offering \([[Ezra.10.18|Ezr.10.18]]-19\). This event highlights the importance of maintaining religious purity and the challenges faced by the Jewish community in the post-exilic period. The inclusion of priests among those who had married foreign women underscores the pervasive nature of the problem and the need for spiritual leadership in the restoration of the community.
