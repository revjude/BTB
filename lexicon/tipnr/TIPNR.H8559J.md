Tamar is mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel as a landmark on the southeastern border of the Promised Land. In Ezekiel's vision of the division of the land among the tribes of Israel, Tamar is listed as a point on the eastern border, alongside the Dead Sea and the Jordan River \(Ezek. 47:18-19\). It is also mentioned as part of the southern border of the portion allotted to the prince \(Ezek. 48:28\). The exact location of Tamar is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the Judean Desert, south of the Dead Sea. Some scholars suggest that it may be identified with the site of Ein Hatzeva, an oasis in the Arava Valley.
