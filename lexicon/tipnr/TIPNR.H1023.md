Beth-merchak is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[2Sam.15.17|2 Samuel 15:17]], during the account of Absalom's revolt against his father, King David. The name Beth-merchak means "house of distance" or "house of the far place" in Hebrew. 

As Absalom's conspiracy gained strength, David decided to flee from Jerusalem to escape the impending danger. The king left the city with his entire household, except for ten concubines who were left to take care of the palace. 

David and his followers stopped at a place some distance from the city, which is referred to as Beth-merchak. The text does not provide the exact location of this place, but it was likely a short distance from Jerusalem, possibly a suburb or a neighboring village. 

At Beth-merchak, David reviewed the people who were with him, including his servants and loyal followers. It was here that he encountered Ittai the Gittite, who pledged his loyalty to David despite being a foreigner.
