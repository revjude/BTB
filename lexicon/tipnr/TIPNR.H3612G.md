Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, was one of the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan \(Num. 13:6\). Along with Joshua, Caleb stood firm in his faith and trust in God's promise, encouraging the Israelites to enter the land despite the other spies' negative report \(Num. 13:30; 14:6-9\). As a result, God commended Caleb for his faithfulness and promised that he would inherit the land he had explored \(Num. 14:24, 30, 38; Deut. 1:36\). After the conquest of Canaan, Caleb requested and received Hebron as his inheritance \(Josh. 14:6-15; 15:13-19; 21:12; Judg. 1:12-15, 20\). He drove out the Anakim giants from Hebron and offered his daughter Achsah in marriage to whoever conquered Kirjath Sepher \(Josh. 15:14-17; Judg. 1:12-13\). Caleb's descendants settled in the Negev region and in the cities of Hebron \(1 Sam. 30:14; 1 Chr. 4:15; 6:56\). His faith, courage, and obedience to God made him a prominent figure in Israel's history, and his story is remembered as an example of unwavering trust in God's promises \(Num. 32:12; Judg. 3:9\).
