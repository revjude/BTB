Helbah was a Canaanite town mentioned in [[Judg.1.31|Judges 1:31]] as one of the places that the tribe of Asher failed to conquer during the period of the judges. After the death of Joshua, the individual tribes were responsible for securing their allocated territories. However, the tribe of Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of several cities, including Helbah, allowing the Canaanites to continue dwelling in the land. The exact location of Helbah is unknown, but it was likely situated within the allotted territory of Asher, in the western Galilee region of northern Israel.
