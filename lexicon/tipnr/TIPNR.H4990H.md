- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.4.7|Ezr.4.7]]; 
- only referred to as Mithredath **<big>[[H4990|מִתְרְדָת]]</big>**.

Mithredath is mentioned in [[Ezra.4.7|Ezra 4:7]] as one of the Persian officials who opposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem during the reign of King Artaxerxes. Along with Bishlam, Tabeel, and the rest of their associates, Mithredath wrote a letter to the king, accusing the Jews of rebuilding the city walls and expressing concern that this would lead to rebellion against the Persian Empire. 

The letter was written in Aramaic and translated, indicating that it was an official document sent to the Persian court. Mithredath and his colleagues urged the king to search the historical records to verify that Jerusalem had a history of rebellion and that allowing the city to be rebuilt would be detrimental to the interests of the empire. 

As a result of this letter, King Artaxerxes issued a decree ordering the Jews to stop their work on the city walls. This opposition from Mithredath and the other officials effectively halted the rebuilding efforts in Jerusalem for a time, until the reign of King Darius when the Jews were allowed to resume their work. 

Mithredath's actions demonstrate the political challenges faced by the Jewish people as they sought to rebuild their homeland and restore their religious practices in the face of opposition from local officials and neighboring peoples.
