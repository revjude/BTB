Man living at the time of Divided Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Abijah</span>, the son of King Jeroboam I, fell ill and died in childhood, as prophesied by Ahijah the prophet.
- A man of the Kingdom of Israel, living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Kgs.14.1|1Ki.14.1]]; 
- only referred to as Abijah **<big>[[H0029|אֲבִיָּה]]</big>**; 
-  son of Jeroboam **<big>[[H3379|יָרׇבְעָם]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Nadab **<big>[[H5070|נָדָב]]</big>**.

Abijah was the son of Jeroboam I, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy. When Abijah fell sick, Jeroboam sent his wife in disguise to the prophet Ahijah to inquire about the child's fate \([[1Kgs.14.1|1 Kings 14:1]]-3\). 

Ahijah, guided by God, recognized Jeroboam's wife and delivered a message of judgment against Jeroboam's house for his idolatry and disobedience. The prophet also revealed that Abijah would die, and indeed, as soon as Jeroboam's wife returned home, the child died \([[1Kgs.14.1|1 Kings 14:1]]2-17\). 

Ahijah prophesied that Abijah would be the only one of Jeroboam's family to receive a proper burial because he was the only one in whom God found something good \([[1Kgs.14.1|1 Kings 14:1]]3\). The death of Abijah was a sign of God's judgment against Jeroboam and his dynasty.
