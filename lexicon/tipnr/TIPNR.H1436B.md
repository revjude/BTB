- A Governor living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Kgs.25.22|2Ki.25.22]]; 
- referred to as Gedaliah **<big>[[H1436|גְּדַּלְיָה]]</big>**, or Gedaliah **<big>[[H1436|גְּדַּלְיָה]]</big>**; 
- a son of Ahikam **<big>[[H0296|אֲחִיקָם]]</big>**.

Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, was appointed governor of Judah by the Babylonians after the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC \([[2Kgs.25.22|2 Kings 25:22]]; [[Jer.40.5|Jeremiah 40:5]]\). He established his base at Mizpah and encouraged the remaining Jews to submit to Babylonian rule and live peacefully in the land \([[Jer.40.9|Jeremiah 40:9]]-10\). Many Jews who had fled to surrounding countries returned to Judah and settled under Gedaliah's leadership \([[Jer.40.11|Jeremiah 40:11]]-12\). However, Ishmael, a member of the royal family, conspired against Gedaliah and assassinated him along with the Babylonian officials and Jews who were with him \([[2Kgs.25.25|2 Kings 25:25]]; [[Jer.41.1|Jeremiah 41:1]]-3\). This act of treachery led to the flight of the remaining Jews to Egypt, fearing Babylonian reprisals \(2 Kings 25:26; [[Jer.41.1|Jeremiah 41:1]]6-18; 43:5-7\). Gedaliah's assassination marked the end of Jewish self-rule in the land and the beginning of the Babylonian exile. The prophet Jeremiah, who had been released from prison by the Babylonians and entrusted to Gedaliah's care \([[Jer.39.14|Jeremiah 39:14]]; 40:5-6\), witnessed these tragic events and mourned the loss of Gedaliah and the fate of his people \([[Jer.41.4|Jeremiah 41:4]]-6\).
