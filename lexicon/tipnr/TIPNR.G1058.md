<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Gallio</span>, the Roman proconsul of Achaia, refused to judge Paul when the Jews brought charges against him in Corinth.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Neh.11.17|Act.18.12]]; 
- only referred to as Gallio<[[G1058]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Γαλλίων</span>\).

Gallio was the Roman proconsul of Achaia, the province that included the city of Corinth, during Paul's second missionary journey \(Acts 18:12\). When the Jews brought charges against Paul, accusing him of persuading people to worship God in ways contrary to the law, Gallio refused to hear the case. He dismissed the charges, stating that he would not get involved in matters of Jewish law and that the Jews should settle the issue among themselves \(Acts 18:14-16\). Gallio's refusal to judge Paul allowed the apostle to continue his ministry in Corinth unhindered. The incident also demonstrates the Roman authorities' general tolerance of early Christian preaching, as long as it did not disturb public order or challenge Roman rule. Gallio's tenure as proconsul of Achaia helps to date Paul's time in Corinth to around 51-52 AD.
