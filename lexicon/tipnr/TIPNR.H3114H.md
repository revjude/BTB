Joiarib is mentioned briefly in [[Ezra.8.16|Ezra 8:16]] as one of the men of understanding whom Ezra sent to Iddo, the leader of the Levites at Casiphia, to bring ministers for the house of God. This event took place during Ezra's journey from Babylon to Jerusalem, as he sought to restore the worship and religious practices of the Jews in their homeland. 

Ezra, a priest and scribe, had been commissioned by King Artaxerxes of Persia to lead a group of Jewish exiles back to Jerusalem. As part of his preparations, Ezra gathered a number of men, including Joiarib, who are described as "men of understanding." This designation suggests that Joiarib and the others were known for their wisdom, discernment, and knowledge of the law. 

Ezra sent these men to Iddo to request that he send Levites to accompany them to Jerusalem. The Levites were essential for the proper functioning of the temple and the maintenance of religious rituals. Joiarib's inclusion in this delegation highlights his trustworthiness and the importance of his role in Ezra's mission. 

No further details are provided about Joiarib's background or his specific contributions to the journey or the restoration of Jerusalem. However, his brief mention in this context underscores the significance of the Levites and the collective effort required to reestablish Jewish religious life in the post-exilic period.
