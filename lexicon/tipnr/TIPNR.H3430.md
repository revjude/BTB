Ishbi-benob was a Philistine warrior described as a descendant of the giants \([[2Sam.21.16|2Sa.21.16]]\). During a battle at Gob, he wielded a bronze spear weighing three hundred shekels and was armed with a new sword. Ishbi-benob attempted to kill King David, who had grown weary in the fight. However, Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to David's aid and struck down the Philistine and killed him. After this incident, David's men urged him not to go out to battle anymore, lest he quench the lamp of Israel \(2Sa.21.17\). This event demonstrates the ongoing conflict between the Israelites and the Philistines during David's reign, as well as the loyalty of David's mighty men.
