Gibeath-elohim, also known as the "Hill of God," was a place mentioned in the account of Saul's anointing as king of Israel. It was located near the city of Gibeah, in the territory of Benjamin. The name "Gibeath-elohim" suggests that it may have been a site of religious significance or a place associated with divine presence. According to [[1Sam.10.5|1 Samuel 10:5]], there was a garrison of Philistines stationed at Gibeath-elohim. This detail indicates that the Philistines, who were the dominant power in the region at the time, had established a military presence there. The presence of the Philistine garrison at Gibeath-elohim highlights the oppression and control that the Israelites were subjected to before the establishment of the monarchy under Saul. Its location remains unknown.
