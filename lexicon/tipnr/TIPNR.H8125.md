He is listed in the genealogical records of the Benjamites, which trace the lineage of the tribe. The text does not provide any specific details about Shamsherai's life, his role within the community, or his achievements. However, his inclusion in the genealogy highlights the importance of documenting family lineages and the presence of Benjamites in Jerusalem. The tribe of Benjamin, along with Judah, remained loyal to the Davidic dynasty after the split of the kingdom and continued to play a significant role in the history of Israel. The mention of Shamsherai and other Benjamites living in Jerusalem underscores the diversity of the population and the representation of various tribes within the city.
