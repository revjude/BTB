Man living at the time of Exile and Return

The descendants of <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Barzillai</span> were a priestly family who returned from Babylonian exile but could not prove their lineage.
- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at Ezr.2.61; 
- only referred to as Barzillai **<big>[[H1271|בַּרְזִלַּי]]</big>**.

Barzillai is mentioned in Ezra 2:61 and Nehemiah 7:63 as the ancestor of a priestly family who returned to Judah from Babylonian exile. According to these passages, the descendants of Habaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai sought to be registered as priests but were unable to prove their priestly lineage. The text states that Barzillai had married a daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite \(likely the same Barzillai who supported David\) and took on his name. Due to the uncertainty surrounding their genealogy, these priests were excluded from serving until a priest could consult the Urim and Thummim for divine guidance. The mention of Barzillai in this context highlights the importance of verifying priestly lineage and maintaining the purity of the priesthood after the exile.
