<small>*Male • Judah's Adullamite friend.*</small>

Man living at the time of the Patriarchs

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Hirah</span> was an Adullamite who was a close friend of Judah, the son of Jacob.
- A man living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.38.1|Gen.38.1]]; 
- only referred to as Hirah **<big>[[H2437|חִירָה]]</big>**.

Hirah is mentioned in [[Gen.38.1|Genesis 38:1]] and 12 as an Adullamite who was a close friend of Judah, the fourth son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\). Adullam was a Canaanite city located in the Shephelah, the foothills between the coastal plain and the Judean hills. 

In [[Gen.38.1|Genesis 38:1]], Judah left his brothers and stayed with Hirah in Adullam. During this time, Judah married a Canaanite woman named Shua and had three sons with her. This event marked a significant departure from the traditions of his family, as marrying outside of the Hebrew people was generally discouraged. 

Later, in [[Gen.38.1|Genesis 38:1]]2, after the death of Judah's wife, he went to Timnah with his friend Hirah to shear his sheep. It was during this trip that Judah encountered his daughter-in-law Tamar, who had disguised herself as a prostitute. Judah, unaware of her true identity, slept with her, resulting in Tamar's pregnancy. 

Hirah's presence in these narratives suggests that he was a trusted companion of Judah and that their friendship endured over time. As an Adullamite, Hirah would have been familiar with the local customs and culture, which may have influenced Judah's decisions and actions during his time away from his family.
