Shua is mentioned in [[Gen.38.2|Genesis 38:2]],12 and [[1Chr.2.3|1 Chronicles 2:3]] as the father of a Canaanite wife of Judah, one of the twelve sons of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\). Judah married Bath-shua, the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua, and she bore him three sons: Er, Onan, and Shelah. The narrative in Genesis 38 focuses on the story of Judah and Tamar, with Bath-shua's sons playing a significant role. Er, Judah's firstborn, was killed by God due to his wickedness, and Onan, who was obligated to provide an heir for his deceased brother, also displeased God and died. Bath-shua is not mentioned beyond her role as the mother of Judah's sons, and her Canaanite origin is significant in the context of the Israelites' relationship with the Canaanites in the Promised Land.
