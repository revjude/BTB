Zephaniah was a prophet of Judah who ministered during the reign of King Josiah, likely in the late 7th century BC. He was the son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah. This genealogy suggests that Zephaniah may have been a descendant of King Hezekiah of Judah. The book of Zephaniah, the ninth book of the Minor Prophets, is attributed to him. In his prophecies, Zephaniah addresses the judgment coming upon Judah and the surrounding nations, as well as the future restoration of God's people. His message emphasizes the Day of the Lord, a time of both judgment and salvation. The book concludes with a promise of hope and joy for the remnant of Israel.
