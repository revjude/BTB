Ahasuerus, also known as Xerxes I, was the king of Persia during the events described in the book of Esther. He ruled over a vast empire from India to Ethiopia. In the third year of his reign, Ahasuerus held a lavish banquet and requested the presence of his queen, Vashti. When she refused to come, the king deposed her. \(Est.1\) 

A search was made for a new queen, and Esther, a young Jewish woman, was chosen. Esther kept her Jewish identity secret. \(Est.2\) Later, Haman, a high official, plotted to destroy the Jews due to his hatred for Mordecai, Esther's cousin. Haman convinced Ahasuerus to issue a decree allowing the annihilation of the Jews. \(Est.3\). 

Esther revealed her Jewish identity to Ahasuerus and exposed Haman's plot. The king ordered Haman's execution and issued a new decree allowing the Jews to defend themselves. \(Est.7-8\) The Jews were victorious over their enemies, and Ahasuerus promoted Mordecai to a high position in the kingdom. \(Est.9-10\). 

Ahasuerus is also mentioned in [[Ezra.4.6|Ezra 4:6]], where his reign is associated with opposition to the rebuilding of Jerusalem, and in [[Dan.9.1|Daniel 9:1]], as the father of Darius the Mede. Xerxes I  ruled 486 to 465.
