- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[2Chr.31.15|2Ch.31.15]]; 
- only referred to as Amariah<[[H0568K]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>ֲ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>מ</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ָ֫<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>הו</span>ּ\).

Amariah is mentioned in the context of King Hezekiah's religious reforms in Judah. Hezekiah, a righteous king, sought to restore proper worship and support for the priests and Levites. \(2Ch.31.1-21\) 

As part of these reforms, Hezekiah ordered the people to contribute portions to support the priests and Levites, enabling them to devote themselves to the Law of the Lord. \(2Ch.31.4\) The people responded generously, bringing an abundance of offerings and tithes. \(2Ch.31.5-10\). 

To ensure the proper distribution of these offerings, Hezekiah appointed officers, including Amariah, to oversee the process. \(2Ch.31.12-15\) Amariah, along with several other Levites, was entrusted with the task of faithfully distributing the offerings to his fellow Levites according to their divisions and responsibilities. \([[2Chr.31.15|2Ch.31.15]]-18\) 

This system of distribution ensured that all the priests and Levites, including those in the cities of Judah, received their rightful share of the offerings, enabling them to focus on their duties in the temple and in teaching the Law to the people. 

The mention of Amariah in this context highlights the importance of the Levites in the administration of the temple and the support system for the religious leaders. It also demonstrates Hezekiah's commitment to restoring proper worship and ensuring the well-being of the priests and Levites.
