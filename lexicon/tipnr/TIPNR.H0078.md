Judge living before Israel's Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Ibzan</span> was a judge of Israel who led the nation for seven years, had thirty sons and thirty daughters, and was buried in Bethlehem.
- A Judge living before Israel's Monarchy, first mentioned at [[Judg.12.8|Jdg.12.8]]; 
- only referred to as Ibzan **<big>[[H0078|אִבְצָן]]</big>**.

Ibzan is mentioned in [[Judg.12.8|Judges 12:8]]-10 as one of the judges who led Israel after the time of Jephthah. He was from Bethlehem, although it is not specified whether this refers to Bethlehem in Judah or another Bethlehem. 

Ibzan judged Israel for seven years. The text mentions that he had thirty sons and thirty daughters. It also states that he sent his daughters abroad in marriage and brought in thirty young women from outside for his sons. This suggests that Ibzan was a man of influence and means, as he was able to arrange marriages for his many children. 

The mention of Ibzan's thirty sons and thirty daughters riding on seventy donkeys \(Judges 12:14\) further emphasizes his wealth and status, as donkeys were a sign of prosperity and importance in ancient times. 

After leading Israel for seven years, Ibzan died and was buried in his hometown of Bethlehem. The brief account of his life and leadership highlights the period of the judges, during which Israel was led by various individuals who delivered the nation from oppression and provided guidance and governance. 

Ibzan's story also illustrates the importance of family and marriage alliances in ancient Israelite society, as well as the significance of the number seven, which often represents completeness or perfection in the Bible.
