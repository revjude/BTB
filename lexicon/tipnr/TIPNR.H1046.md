Beth-pelet, meaning "house of escape" or "house of flight" in Hebrew, was a town located in the southern part of Judah's territory, in the Negev region. It is mentioned twice in the Bible, first in [[Josh.15.27|Joshua 15:27]] as part of the list of towns allotted to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land. 

The second mention of Beth-pelet is in [[Neh.11.26|Nehemiah 11:26]], where it is listed among the towns resettled by the people of Judah after their return from the Babylonian exile. This suggests that Beth-pelet was one of the towns that had been inhabited by the Judahites before the exile and was later reoccupied when they returned to their homeland. 

The exact location of Beth-pelet is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the arid region south of Hebron, along with other towns mentioned in the same context, such as Moladah, Hazar-shual, and Beersheba. 

No other information about Beth-pelet is provided in the Bible, and the town is not mentioned in any other historical or archaeological context. Its name, "house of escape" or "house of flight," may refer to its function as a place of refuge or to a local event or feature associated with escape or flight.
