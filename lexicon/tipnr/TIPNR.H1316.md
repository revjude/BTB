Bashan was a region located east of the Jordan River, known for its fertile land, lush pastures, and abundant livestock. It was conquered by the Israelites during the time of Moses, along with the territories of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan \(Numbers 21:33; Deuteronomy 3:1-11\). The land of Bashan was allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh \([[Num.32.33|Numbers 32:33]]; Joshua 13:29-31\). 

The region was known for its strong oak trees \([[Isa.2.13|Isaiah 2:13]]; [[Ezek.27.6|Ezekiel 27:6]]\) and its well-nourished cattle, often referred to as the "bulls of Bashan" \(Deuteronomy 32:14; Psalm 22:12; Amos 4:1\). It was also famous for its rich pastures \([[Jer.50.19|Jeremiah 50:19]]; [[Mic.7.14|Micah 7:14]]\) and its fertile soil, which was well-suited for growing crops \(Psalm 135:11; 136:20\). 

Bashan was one of the regions from which Solomon received supplies for his royal court \([[1Kgs.4.13|1 Kings 4:13]]\). It was also the homeland of Golan, one of the cities of refuge designated by Moses \(Deuteronomy 4:43; [[Josh.20.8|Joshua 20:8]]; 21:27\). 

Several Old Testament passages use Bashan as a symbol of God's power and judgment \(Psalm 68:15, 22; [[Isa.33.9|Isaiah 33:9]]; [[Jer.22.20|Jeremiah 22:20]]; [[Ezek.39.18|Ezekiel 39:18]]; [[Zech.11.2|Zechariah 11:2]]\). The region was also mentioned in the context of God's blessings and provision for His people \(Deuteronomy 33:22; [[Neh.9.22|Nehemiah 9:22]]\).
