Philip was one of the sons of Herod the Great and ruled as tetrarch over the regions of Iturea and Traconitis \([[Luke.3.1|Luke 3:1]]\). He was a half-brother to Herod Antipas, who ruled Galilee and Perea, and Herod Archelaus, who ruled Judea, Samaria, and Idumea. Philip's reign coincided with the beginning of John the Baptist's ministry and the early years of Jesus' life. The specific dates of his rule are not provided in the Bible, but historical records indicate that he reigned from 4 BC to AD 34. Philip is described by the Jewish historian Josephus as a moderate and peaceful ruler who was devoted to his subjects. He is not mentioned in connection with any of the events in Jesus' life or ministry.
