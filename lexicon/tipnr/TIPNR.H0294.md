Ahisamach was a member of the tribe of Dan and is mentioned in the Bible as the father of Oholiab, a skilled artisan who played a significant role in the construction of the tabernacle. 

When God instructed Moses to build the tabernacle, He appointed Bezalel from the tribe of Judah and Oholiab from the tribe of Dan to oversee the craftsmanship. \(Exo.31.1-6\) Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, was filled with wisdom, understanding, and knowledge in all kinds of crafts, including designing and working with gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood. \([[Exod.35.34|Exo.35.34]]\). 

Together with Bezalel, Oholiab led the skilled artisans in creating the intricate components of the tabernacle, such as the ark of the testimony, the mercy seat, the table of showbread, the lampstand, the altar of incense, and the altar of burnt offering. They also crafted the priestly garments and other items used in worship. \([[Exod.38.23|Exo.38.23]]\) 

Although Ahisamach himself is not described as participating in the tabernacle's construction, his mention as Oholiab's father highlights the family's giftedness and the important role they played in the building of the sacred structure.
