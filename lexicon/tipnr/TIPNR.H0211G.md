Ophir was one of the sons of Joktan, a descendant of Shem through Eber \([[Gen.10.29|Genesis 10:29]]; [[1Chr.1.23|1 Chronicles 1:23]]\). He is mentioned in the Table of Nations, which lists the descendants of Noah's sons after the flood. Joktan's descendants, including Ophir, are said to have settled in the region "from Mesha all the way to Sephar, the eastern hill country" \(Genesis 10:30\). The exact location of this region is uncertain, but it is generally believed to be in the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula. The name Ophir is also associated with a land famous for its wealth and gold \(e.g., 1 Kings 9:28; 10:11; 22:48; 1 Chronicles 29:4; 2 Chronicles 8:18; 9:10; Job 22:24; 28:16; Psalm 45:9; Isaiah 13:12\), but it is unclear if this land was named after Joktan's son or another individual.
