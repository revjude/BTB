Shinar was an ancient territory first mentioned in Genesis as the location of several important cities including Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh \([[Gen.10.10|Genesis 10:10]]\). This region became historically significant immediately after the Flood when people migrated to a plain in Shinar and built the Tower of Babel \([[Gen.11.2|Genesis 11:2]]\). 

 The area was ruled by powerful kings from an early period. Amraphel, king of Shinar, appears among the coalition of kings who fought against the cities of the plain during Abraham's time \([[Gen.14.1|Genesis 14:1]],9\). This demonstrates the region's significant political influence in the ancient Near East. 

 Shinar's wealth and craftsmanship were renowned. During the conquest of Canaan, Achan coveted and stole a beautiful robe from Shinar among other valuable items \([[Josh.7.21|Joshua 7:21]]\). The quality of its goods made them highly desirable as plunder. 

 The region maintained its importance throughout biblical history. Isaiah mentioned Shinar among the places from which God would recover the remnant of His people \([[Isa.11.11|Isaiah 11:11]]\). During the Babylonian exile, King Nebuchadnezzar took vessels from Jerusalem's temple to "the land of Shinar," to the house of his god \([[Dan.1.2|Daniel 1:2]]\). 

 In a prophetic vision, Zechariah saw wickedness being transported to Shinar, where a house would be built for it \([[Zech.5.11|Zechariah 5:11]]\), suggesting the region's enduring association with rebellion against God. 

 Probably corresponds to ancient Sumer and Babylonia, encompassing the southern portion of modern Iraq between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
