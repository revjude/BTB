Adoram, also referred to as Adoniram or Hadoram, was a prominent official who served under three successive kings of Israel: David, Solomon, and Rehoboam. He is primarily known for his role in overseeing the forced labor used in various construction projects. 

During King David's reign, Adoram was mentioned as being in charge of the forced labor \([[2Sam.20.24|2 Samuel 20:24]]\). This suggests that he was responsible for organizing and supervising the workers conscripted for royal building projects. 

Under King Solomon, Adoram \(called Adoniram in [[1Kgs.4.6|1 Kings 4:6]]\) continued to hold the position of being in charge of the forced labor. Solomon undertook extensive building projects, including the construction of the temple and his royal palace, which required a significant workforce. Adoniram was tasked with managing the labor force, which included both Israelites and foreign workers \(1 Kings 5:13\).
