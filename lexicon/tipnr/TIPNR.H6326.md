- A woman living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, only mentioned at [[Exod.1.15|Exo.1.15]];

Puah was one of the two Hebrew midwives mentioned in [[Exod.1.15|Exodus 1:15]], along with Shiphrah. They lived in Egypt during the time when the Israelites were enslaved and oppressed by the Egyptians. The Pharaoh, fearing the growing population of the Hebrews, ordered the midwives to kill any male children born to Hebrew women \([[Exod.1.15|Exodus 1:15]]-16\). However, Puah and Shiphrah feared God and did not follow Pharaoh's command. Instead, they allowed the male children to live \(Exodus 1:17\). When questioned by Pharaoh about their disobedience, the midwives claimed that the Hebrew women gave birth quickly, before they could arrive \(Exodus 1:18-19\). God blessed Puah and Shiphrah for their bravery and gave them families of their own \(Exodus 1:20-21\). The defiance of Puah and Shiphrah is an example of faith and courage in the face of oppression, and their actions played a role in the preservation of the Hebrew people during a time of great adversity.
