Hazor was a town located in the Negev region, the southern part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Judah. It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Josh.15.23|Joshua 15:23]], as part of the list of towns and villages in the southland of Judah. 

In the context of Joshua 15, the chapter describes the boundaries and cities of Judah's inheritance in the Promised Land. The list of towns is divided into several geographical regions, including the Negev, the lowland, and the hill country. 

Hazor is listed among other towns in the Negev, such as Kedesh, Ithnan, Ziph, Telem, and Bealoth. The exact location of this Hazor is uncertain, as it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in other historical sources. 

The name "Hazor" is derived from the Hebrew word meaning "enclosure" or "settlement," suggesting that it may have been a fortified town or a well-known encampment in the region. 

The mention of Hazor in the biblical text serves to provide a detailed account of the cities and villages allotted to the tribe of Judah and to underscore the fulfillment of God's promise to give each tribe a portion of the Promised Land as an inheritance. Its inclusion in the list also highlights the importance of geographical accuracy and attention to detail in the recording of Israel's history and the allotment of the land.
