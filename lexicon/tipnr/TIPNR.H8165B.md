Seir is mentioned in [[Gen.36.20|Genesis 36:20]]-21 and [[1Chr.1.38|1 Chronicles 1:38]] as a Horite chief and an ancestor of the Horites who inhabited the land of Seir. The Horites were the original inhabitants of the region of Seir before the descendants of Esau settled there. Seir is listed among the sons of Seir the Horite, indicating that he was a prominent figure among the Horite clans. The land of Seir, located in the region of Edom, south of the Dead Sea, was named after Seir the Horite. The descendants of Esau, also known as the Edomites, later inhabited this region and intermarried with the Horites.
