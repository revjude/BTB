Mahlon was the son of Elimelech and Naomi from Bethlehem in Judah. He had a brother named Chilion. Due to a famine in Judah, Elimelech took his family to live in the country of Moab. There, Mahlon married a Moabite woman named Ruth. However, Elimelech, Mahlon, and Chilion all died in Moab, leaving Naomi and her daughters-in-law as widows. When Naomi decided to return to Judah, Ruth chose to go with her. In Bethlehem, Boaz, a relative of Elimelech, acted as a kinsman-redeemer. He married Ruth and bought the property that had belonged to Elimelech, Chilion, and Mahlon to maintain their inheritance \(Ruth 1:2, 5; 4:9, 10\).
