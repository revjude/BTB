Shemida was a son of Gilead and a great-grandson of Manasseh, as mentioned in [[Num.26.32|Numbers 26:32]], [[Josh.17.2|Joshua 17:2]], and [[1Chr.7.19|1 Chronicles 7:19]]. He was one of the descendants of Joseph through Manasseh, and his clan, the Shemidaites, is listed among the families of Manasseh who received an inheritance in the Promised Land. In the census conducted in the plains of Moab \(Numbers 26\), the Shemidaites are counted among the clans of Manasseh. Shemida's descendants are also mentioned in the context of the division of the land under Joshua \([[Josh.17.2|Joshua 17:2]]\), where they are allocated a portion of the territory assigned to Manasseh. Beyond these genealogical and territorial references, no further details are provided about Shemida's life or his role in the history of Israel.
