Chilmad is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Ezek.27.23|Ezekiel 27:23]], as one of the trading partners of the city of Tyre. In this passage, Ezekiel prophesies about the destruction of Tyre and lists various nations and cities that traded with it, including Haran, Canneh, Eden, Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad. 

The exact location of Chilmad is unknown, and there is little information about it outside of this single reference in Ezekiel. It is possible that Chilmad was a city or region in Mesopotamia, as it is mentioned alongside other places in that area, such as Haran and Asshur. 

The context of the passage suggests that Chilmad was known for its trade and commercial activities, as it is listed among the merchants and suppliers of Tyre. However, the specific goods or products that Chilmad traded are not mentioned in the text. 

Given the limited information available, Chilmad appears to have been a place of some commercial significance during the time of Ezekiel, but its precise location and role in the ancient Near Eastern trade network remain uncertain.
