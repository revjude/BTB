Ezer was one of the sons of Ephraim, the son of Joseph \([[1Chr.7.21|1 Chronicles 7:21]]\). He was born in Egypt before the Israelites' exodus. Ezer, along with his brother Elead, was killed by the men of Gath when they went to raid the livestock of the Gathites \([[1Chr.7.21|1 Chronicles 7:21]]\). This event caused great grief to their father, Ephraim, who mourned for many days. The incident highlights the ongoing conflicts between the Israelites and the inhabitants of Canaan during their early history.
