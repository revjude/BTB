Elioenai is mentioned in the Book of Ezra as one of the priests who had married foreign women during the Babylonian exile \([[Ezra.10.22|Ezr.10.22]]\). After the return to Jerusalem, Ezra discovered that many Israelites, including priests and Levites, had intermarried with the neighboring peoples, which was against God's command. Elioenai was among those who had taken foreign wives, but he agreed to put away his wife as part of the covenant renewal led by Ezra. The Bible does not provide any further details about Elioenai's life or priestly duties.
