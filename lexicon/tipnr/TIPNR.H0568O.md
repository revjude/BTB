- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[Zeph.1.1|Zep.1.1]]; 
- only referred to as Amariah **<big>[[H0568|אֲמַרְיָה]]</big>**; 
- a son of Hezekiah **<big>[[H2396|חִזְקִיָּה]]</big>**; 
-  father of Gedaliah **<big>[[H1436|גְּדַּלְיָה]]</big>**.

Amariah is mentioned in the opening verse of the Book of Zephaniah, which provides the prophet's genealogy. He is listed as the great-grandfather of Zephaniah, who prophesied during the reign of King Josiah of Judah. \([[Zeph.1.1|Zep.1.1]]\) 

The genealogy traces Zephaniah's lineage back four generations: Zephaniah, son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah. This suggests that Zephaniah came from a notable family, possibly with royal or priestly connections, as the name Hezekiah may refer to the king of Judah. 

Amariah's inclusion in this genealogy helps to establish Zephaniah's credibility and authority as a prophet. It also provides a historical context for Zephaniah's ministry, placing him during the reign of King Josiah, who instituted significant religious reforms in Judah. \(2Ki.22-23\) 

Apart from being mentioned in Zephaniah's genealogy, no further details are provided about Amariah's life, his role, or any significant events associated with him. 

The mention of Amariah in this context serves to underscore the importance of family lineage in establishing the legitimacy and authority of prophetic figures in ancient Israel. It also highlights the continuity of God's message through successive generations of His servants.
