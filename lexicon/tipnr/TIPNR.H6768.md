Zelek was an Ammonite who was counted among David's mighty men, the elite group of warriors who fought alongside him. He is mentioned in the lists of David's mighty men in both 2 Samuel and 1 Chronicles. The fact that an Ammonite was included among David's most trusted soldiers is significant, as the Ammonites were often enemies of Israel. Zelek's presence in this group suggests that he had proven his loyalty and skill in battle.
