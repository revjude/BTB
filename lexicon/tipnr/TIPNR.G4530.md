Salim is mentioned in the Gospel of John as a place near Aenon where John the Baptist was baptizing people. The text notes that John chose this location because there was plenty of water available \([[John.3.23|John 3:23]]\). The exact location of Salim is uncertain, but it was likely situated somewhere in the Jordan Valley, possibly near the Jordan River or one of its tributaries. Some scholars suggest that Salim may be identified with the modern-day village of Ain Salim, located east of Nablus in the West Bank, while others propose alternative locations. The proximity to water was essential for John's baptismal ministry, as it allowed for full immersion of those who came to be baptized.
