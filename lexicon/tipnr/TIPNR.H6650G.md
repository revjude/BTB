Zeboim is mentioned in [[Neh.11.34|Nehemiah 11:34]] as one of the towns resettled by the people of Judah after their return from the Babylonian exile. This Zeboim is distinct from the ancient city of Zeboiim that was destroyed along with Sodom and Gomorrah. In the context of Nehemiah 11, the resettlement of towns and villages surrounding Jerusalem is described, with people from Judah and Benjamin inhabiting these places. Zeboim is listed among other towns such as Hadid, Neballat, Lod, and Ono, suggesting that it was located in the region of Judah, possibly in the Shephelah \(lowlands\) or the coastal plain. The mention of Zeboim in this passage highlights the efforts of the returning exiles to reestablish their presence in the land and rebuild their communities after the Babylonian captivity. However, no further details about this specific town are provided in the Bible.
