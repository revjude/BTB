Bunni was a Levite who lived in Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah \(Neh. 11:15\). After the completion of the wall of Jerusalem, Nehemiah organized the resettlement of the city, ensuring that a tenth of the population, including various leaders and officials, would reside within the city walls. Bunni is mentioned among the Levites who were chosen to live in Jerusalem. The presence of Levites in the city was crucial for maintaining the spiritual life of the community, as they were responsible for the temple services and religious instruction. Bunni's inclusion in the list of Levites residing in Jerusalem highlights his role in the spiritual leadership of the nation and the importance of having Levites present in the holy city.
