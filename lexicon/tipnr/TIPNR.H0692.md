Man living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Areli</span>, a son of Gad, is mentioned in the genealogy of Jacob and the census of the Israelites in the wilderness.
- A man from the tribe of Gad living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Gen.46.16|Gen.46.16]]; 
- referred to as Areli or Arelite **<big>[[H0692|אַרְאֵלִי]]</big>**; 
-  son of Gad **<big>[[H1410|גָּד]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Ziphion **<big>[[H6837|צִפְיוֹן]]</big>**, Haggi **<big>[[H2291|חַגִּי]]</big>**, Shuni **<big>[[H7764|שׁוּנִי]]</big>**, Ezbon **<big>[[H0675|אֶצְבּוֹן]]</big>**, Eri **<big>[[H6179|עֵרִי]]</big>** and Arod **<big>[[H0720|אֲרוֹד]]</big>**.

Areli is mentioned in the Old Testament as one of the sons of Gad, who was one of the twelve sons of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\). In [[Gen.46.16|Genesis 46:16]], Areli is listed among the descendants of Jacob who went down to Egypt during the time of famine. This genealogical record emphasizes the growth of the Israelite clan and the fulfillment of God's promise to make them a great nation. 

Areli is also mentioned in the book of Numbers, during the census of the Israelites taken in the wilderness of Moab, near the end of their forty years of wandering. In [[Num.26.17|Numbers 26:17]], the descendants of Areli are listed as a clan within the tribe of Gad. This census was taken to determine the military strength of each tribe and to prepare for the allocation of the Promised Land among the tribes. 

Apart from these mentions in the genealogical records and census, no further details about Areli's life or his descendants are provided in the biblical text. His inclusion in these lists highlights the continuity of the Israelite tribes and their growth as a nation, in fulfillment of God's promises to their forefathers.
