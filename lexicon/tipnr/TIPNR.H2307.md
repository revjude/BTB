Hadid was a town located in the territory of Benjamin, mentioned in the context of the return of the Jewish exiles from Babylon. In the lists of the people who returned to Judah under the leadership of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, the men of Hadid are counted among the returnees \([[Ezra.2.33|Ezra 2:33]]; [[Neh.7.37|Nehemiah 7:37]]\). These lists suggest that Hadid was one of the towns resettled by the returning exiles as they reestablished their presence in the land. Hadid is also mentioned in the account of the resettlement of Jerusalem, where some of the people of Judah settled in Hadid and its surrounding villages \([[Neh.11.34|Nehemiah 11:34]]\). The town's inclusion in this list indicates that it was part of the region surrounding Jerusalem and played a role in the reestablishment of Jewish communities after the exile. The exact location of Hadid is not specified in the Bible, but it is believed to be situated in the vicinity of Lod \(Lydda\) and Ono, towns located in the western part of Benjamin's territory, near the border with Judah.
