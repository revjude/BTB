- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[2Tim.4.21|2Ti.4.21]]; 
- only referred to as Pudens<[[G4227]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Πούδης</span>\).

Pudens is mentioned briefly in [[2Tim.4.21|2 Timothy 4:21]] as one of the individuals in Rome who sent greetings to Timothy through Paul's letter. Paul, who was imprisoned in Rome at the time, was writing to Timothy to encourage him and provide final instructions. In the closing section of the letter, Paul conveys greetings from several believers in Rome, including Pudens. The inclusion of Pudens in this list suggests that he was a member of the Christian community in Rome and likely had a personal connection with both Paul and Timothy. However, no further details are provided about Pudens' background, his role in the church, or his relationship with Paul and Timothy. The mention of Pudens, along with the others who sent greetings, highlights the close-knit nature of the early Christian community and the importance of personal relationships and support among believers, even across geographical distances.
