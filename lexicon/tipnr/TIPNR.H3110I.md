Johanan is briefly mentioned in [[1Chr.3.24|1 Chronicles 3:24]] as part of the genealogy of King David's descendants. He is listed as one of the sons of Elioenai, who was a descendant of King Jehoiachin \(also known as Jeconiah\). Jehoiachin was one of the last kings of Judah before the Babylonian exile, and he was taken captive to Babylon in 597 BC \(2Ki.24.15\). 

The mention of Johanan in this genealogy demonstrates that David's lineage continued even after the exile, and it highlights the importance of maintaining family records. However, no additional information is provided about Johanan's life, his specific role within the family, or any notable achievements. His inclusion in the genealogy serves primarily to trace the ongoing fulfillment of God's promise to establish David's throne forever \(2Sa.7.16\).
