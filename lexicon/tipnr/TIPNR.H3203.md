Jecoliah is mentioned in [[2Kgs.15.2|2 Kings 15:2]] and [[2Chr.26.3|2 Chronicles 26:3]] as the mother of King Uzziah, who is also referred to as Azariah. She was from Jerusalem, but no further information is provided about her background or family. Jecoliah's son Uzziah became king of Judah at the age of sixteen and reigned for fifty-two years. He is described as a king who did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, although he did not remove the high places where people offered sacrifices and burned incense. Uzziah's reign was marked by military successes and a strengthening of Judah's defenses. However, when he attempted to burn incense in the temple, which was a task reserved for the priests, he was struck with leprosy and had to live in isolation until his death. Jecoliah's mention as Uzziah's mother highlights the importance of maternal lineage in the royal succession and the historical record of Judah's kings.
