Mica, also known as Micah, is mentioned in the books of 1 Chronicles and Nehemiah as one of the Levites who resided in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile \([[1Chr.9.15|1Ch.9.15]]; [[Neh.11.17|Neh.11.17]]\). He was a descendant of Asaph, one of the three main Levitical singers appointed by David. In the post-exilic period, Mica is described as the son of Zichri and a leader of the Levites. He is also mentioned as being second to Mattaniah in thanksgiving and prayer. These details suggest that Mica played a significant role in the worship and spiritual life of the Jewish community in Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah.
