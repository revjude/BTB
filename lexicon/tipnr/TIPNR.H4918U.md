- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Neh.10.7|Neh.10.7]]; 
- only referred to as Meshullam **<big>[[H4918|מְשֻׁלָּם]]</big>**.

Meshullam is mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as one of the priests who sealed the covenant with Nehemiah \([[Neh.10.7|Neh.10.7]]\). After the public reading of the Law and the people's confession of their sins, the leaders, priests, and Levites entered into a covenant to follow God's Law and uphold its requirements. Meshullam was among the priests who signed and sealed this covenant, pledging to adhere to its stipulations. Later, during the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, Meshullam is mentioned again as one of the priests who participated in the procession and the dedication ceremonies \([[Neh.12.33|Neh.12.33]]\). This suggests that Meshullam held a significant role within the priesthood and actively contributed to the spiritual life of the community.
