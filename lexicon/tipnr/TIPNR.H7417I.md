Rimmon is mentioned in [[Josh.15.32|Joshua 15:32]] as one of the towns allotted to the tribe of Judah in the Negev region. It is listed among the towns in the southern part of Judah's territory. In [[Josh.19.7|Joshua 19:7]] and [[1Chr.4.32|1 Chronicles 4:32]], Rimmon is included in the list of towns given to the tribe of Simeon within Judah's inheritance. This suggests that Rimmon was initially part of Judah's territory but was later assigned to Simeon. The exact location of Rimmon is not specified, but it was situated in the Negev, the southern desert region of Judah.
