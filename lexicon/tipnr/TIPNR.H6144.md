Ar was the capital city of Moab, a kingdom located east of the Dead Sea in what is now modern-day Jordan. The city is mentioned several times in the Old Testament, particularly in the context of Israel's journey through the wilderness and in prophetic messages concerning Moab. 

During the Israelites' journey from Egypt to the Promised Land, they passed through the territory of Moab. God instructed them not to harass or provoke the Moabites, as He had given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession \(Deuteronomy 2:9\). The Israelites bypassed Ar and continued their journey \(Deuteronomy 2:18\). 

In Numbers 21, the Israelites' journey is described, mentioning the valleys that extend to the site of Ar and lie along the border of Moab \([[Num.21.15|Numbers 21:15]]\). Later in the chapter, a poetic passage refers to a fire that came out of Heshbon and consumed Ar of Moab \([[Num.21.28|Numbers 21:28]]\), likely alluding to a past military conquest. 

The prophet Isaiah also mentions Ar in his prophecy against Moab, declaring that Ar is laid waste and destroyed in a night \([[Isa.15.1|Isaiah 15:1]]\). This prophecy foretells the coming judgment on Moab and its capital city. 

The exact location of Ar is uncertain, but it is generally associated with the modern city of Rabba, about 15 miles \(24 km\) south of the Arnon River. As the capital of Moab, Ar would have been a significant political and economic center in the region.
