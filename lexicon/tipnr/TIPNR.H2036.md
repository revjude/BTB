<small>*Male • King of Gezer, defeated by Joshua.*</small>

Man living before Israel's Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Horam</span>, the king of Gezer, came to help Lachish but was defeated by Joshua and the Israelites.
- A man living before Israel's Monarchy, only mentioned at [[Josh.10.33|Jos.10.33]]; 
- only referred to as Horam **<big>[[H2036|הֹרָם]]</big>**.

Horam was the king of Gezer, a Canaanite city, during the time of Joshua's conquest of the Promised Land. He is mentioned briefly in [[Josh.10.33|Joshua 10:33]]. 

When the Israelites, led by Joshua, were attacking the city of Lachish, Horam came with his army to help defend the city. However, Joshua and the Israelites defeated Horam and his people, striking them down and leaving no survivors. 

The defeat of Horam and the capture of Gezer were part of Joshua's campaign to conquer the southern cities of Canaan. The victory over Gezer and its king demonstrated the power of God fighting on behalf of the Israelites and the fulfillment of His promise to give them the land. 

The brief mention of Horam in the Bible serves to highlight the Israelites' success in conquering the Canaanite cities and the faithfulness of God in helping them achieve their goal of settling in the Promised Land.
