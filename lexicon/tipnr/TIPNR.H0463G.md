Eliam, also referred to as Ammiel, is mentioned in [[2Sam.11.3|2 Samuel 11:3]] and [[1Chr.3.5|1 Chronicles 3:5]] as the father of Bathsheba. Bathsheba was the wife of Uriah the Hittite, one of David's mighty men. David committed adultery with Bathsheba, and after discovering that she was pregnant, he arranged for Uriah to be killed in battle. David then married Bathsheba, and their first child died as a consequence of David's sin. Later, Bathsheba gave birth to Solomon, who would succeed David as king. The name Eliam means "God of the people," while Ammiel means "my kinsman is God." The reason for the variation in Eliam's name is not explicitly stated in the biblical text.
