Phoenicia was an ancient region and civilization located along the Mediterranean coast, primarily in modern-day Lebanon and parts of Syria and Israel. The Phoenicians were known for their maritime skills, extensive trade networks, and their development of the alphabet. In the New Testament, Phoenicia is mentioned in the context of the early spread of Christianity. After the persecution that arose following Stephen's death, some believers traveled as far as Phoenicia, preaching the gospel \(Acts 11:19\). Later, when Paul and Barnabas were returning from the Jerusalem Council, they passed through Phoenicia, bringing joy to the believers there \(Acts 15:3\). During Paul's final journey to Jerusalem, he sailed to Tyre, a city in Phoenicia, where he stayed with disciples for seven days \(Acts 21:2-4\). Although the Phoenicians are not mentioned extensively in the Bible, their region played a role in the spread of the gospel in the early church era.
