The Most Holy Place, also known as the Holy of Holies, was the innermost room of the tabernacle and later the temple in Jerusalem. It was separated from the Holy Place by a veil \(Exod. 26:31-33\). The Ark of the Covenant, which contained the tablets of the Ten Commandments, was kept in the Most Holy Place \(Exod. 25:10-22; 1 Kgs. 8:6\). The high priest entered the Most Holy Place only once a year, on the Day of Atonement, to make atonement for the sins of the people \(Lev. 16\). The Most Holy Place was a perfect cube, measuring 20 cubits in length, width, and height \(1 Kgs. 6:20; 2 Chr. 3:8\). It was overlaid with pure gold and contained gold cherubim \(1 Kgs. 6:28; 2 Chr. 3:10-13\). The Most Holy Place represented the dwelling place of God among His people.
