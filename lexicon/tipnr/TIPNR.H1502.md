- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.48|Ezr.2.48]]; 
- only referred to as Gazzam<[[H1502]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ג</span>ַּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ז</span>ָּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ם</span>\).

Gazzam is mentioned in [[Ezra.2.48|Ezra 2:48]] and [[Neh.7.51|Nehemiah 7:51]] as an ancestor of a group of temple servants, also known as Nethinim, who returned to Jerusalem from the Babylonian exile. The Nethinim were a class of temple personnel who assisted the Levites in the maintenance and service of the temple \(Ezra 8:20\). They were likely descendants of the Gibeonites who were assigned by Joshua to serve as woodcutters and water carriers for the altar of the Lord \(Joshua 9:23, 27\). In the lists of the exiles who returned to Jerusalem under the leadership of Zerubbabel \(Ezra 2\) and Nehemiah \(Nehemiah 7\), the descendants of Gazzam are counted among the Nethinim. This suggests that Gazzam's descendants had faithfully carried out their duties in the temple service, even during the exile, and were part of the group who returned to restore worship in Jerusalem.
