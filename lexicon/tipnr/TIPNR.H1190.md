Baal-shalishah is mentioned in [[2Kgs.4.42|2 Kings 4:42]] as the hometown of a man who brought provisions to the prophet Elisha during a time of famine. The man brought twenty loaves of barley bread and some heads of new grain to Elisha at Gilgal. Elisha instructed the man to give the food to the people to eat, and despite the man's doubts about the sufficiency of the food for a hundred people, there was enough for everyone to eat, with some left over, as per the word of the Lord. The exact location of Baal-shalishah is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the region of Ephraim, as Gilgal was located in that area.
