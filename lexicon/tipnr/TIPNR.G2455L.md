Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Judas</span> was a Christian living on Straight Street in Damascus, where Saul \(Paul\) stayed after his conversion.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Gal.2.14|Act.9.11]]; 
- only referred to as Judas **<big>[[G2455|Ἰούδας]]</big>**.

Judas is mentioned in Acts 9:11 as a Christian living on Straight Street in Damascus. The context of the passage is Saul's \(later known as Paul\) conversion and his subsequent visit to Damascus \(Acts 9:1-19\). 

After Saul's encounter with the risen Christ on the road to Damascus, he was blinded and led into the city \(Acts 9:8\). In a vision, the Lord instructed Ananias, a disciple in Damascus, to go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and find Saul \(Acts 9:11\). 

The mention of Judas' house on Straight Street suggests that he was a Christian who provided lodging for believers visiting or living in Damascus. Straight Street was a well-known thoroughfare in the city, and Judas' house likely served as a meeting place for the early Christian community there. 

No further information is provided about Judas' background, occupation, or role in the church. His brief mention in the narrative highlights the hospitality and support of the early Christian community during the time of Saul's conversion and early ministry.
