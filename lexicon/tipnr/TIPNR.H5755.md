Ivvah, also known as Avva, was a city that was conquered by the Assyrians. It is mentioned in [[2Kgs.18.34|2 Kings 18:34]] and 19:13, as well as in [[Isa.37.13|Isaiah 37:13]], as one of the cities whose gods could not save them from the Assyrian invasion. The people of Ivvah, along with those from other conquered cities, were later resettled in Samaria by the Assyrian king \([[2Kgs.17.24|2 Kings 17:24]]\). These people, known as the Avvites, continued to worship their own gods in their new land \([[2Kgs.17.31|2 Kings 17:31]]\). The exact location of Ivvah is unknown, but it was likely situated somewhere in Syria or Mesopotamia.
