Seled is mentioned twice in 1 Chronicles 2:30 as a son of Nadab, who was a descendant of Judah. The passage states that Seled died without having any children. This brief mention of Seled is part of a genealogical record of the tribe of Judah, focusing on the descendants of Hezron. The fact that Seled died childless is significant in the context of genealogies, as it marks the end of a particular line of descent.
