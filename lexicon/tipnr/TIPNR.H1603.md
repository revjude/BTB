- A man living before Israel's Monarchy, first mentioned at [[Judg.9.26|Jdg.9.26]]; 
- only referred to as Gaal **<big>[[H1603|גַּעַל]]</big>**; 
- a son of Ebed **<big>[[H5651|עֶבֶד]]</big>**.

Gaal, the son of Ebed, appears in Judges 9 as the leader of a revolt against Abimelech, the ruler of Shechem. After Abimelech had ruled Shechem for three years, Gaal arrived in the city and gained the trust of the people \([[Judg.9.26|Judges 9:26]]-29\). He challenged Abimelech's authority and encouraged the people to follow him instead. When Abimelech was informed of Gaal's actions, he devised a plan to attack the city \([[Judg.9.30|Judges 9:30]]-33\). Gaal and his followers went out to fight against Abimelech but were defeated and driven out of Shechem \(Judges 9:34-41\). Abimelech then destroyed the city and scattered salt over it, symbolizing its complete destruction \(Judges 9:45\). The story of Gaal's failed revolt illustrates the internal conflicts and power struggles that occurred during the period of the judges in Israel.
