Mahalath is mentioned in 2 Chronicles as one of the wives of King Rehoboam, the son of Solomon and the first king of the Kingdom of Judah after the division of the united monarchy \([[2Chr.11.18|2Ch.11.18]]\). She was the daughter of Jerimoth, who was a son of David, making her a granddaughter of King David. Rehoboam's marriage to Mahalath, along with his other wife Abihail, is recorded in the context of his family life and his establishment of his royal household \([[2Chr.11.18|2Ch.11.18]]-23\). The chronicler notes that Rehoboam loved Mahalath and Abihail more than his other wives and concubines \(2Ch.11.21\). This marriage alliance with a descendant of David likely served to strengthen Rehoboam's claim to the throne and his connection to the Davidic dynasty. No further details are provided about Mahalath's personal life or her influence in the royal court. Her inclusion in the biblical record highlights the importance of marital alliances and family lineage in the political and social structure of the Judean monarchy.
