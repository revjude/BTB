Adithaim is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Josh.15.36|Joshua 15:36]], as one of the towns allotted to the tribe of Judah in the Shephelah \(foothills\) region. It is listed along with other towns such as Shaaraim, Gederah, and Gederothaim, suggesting its location was in the western part of Judah's territory, between the coastal plain and the hill country. No other information is provided about Adithaim in the Bible, and its exact location is unknown. As part of Judah's inheritance, Adithaim would have been settled by members of the tribe of Judah following the conquest of Canaan under Joshua.
