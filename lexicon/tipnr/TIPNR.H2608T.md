- Daniel's compatriot living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Dan.1.6|Dan.1.6]]; 
- referred to as Hananiah **<big>[[H2608|חֲנַנְיָה]]</big>**, or Hananiah **<big>[[H2608|חֲנַנְיָה]]</big>**, or Shadrach **<big>[[H7714|שַׁדְרַךְ]]</big>**, or Shadrach **<big>[[H7715|שַׁדְרַךְ]]</big>**.

Hananiah, also known by his Babylonian name Shadrach, was one of the three friends of Daniel who were taken into captivity to Babylon during the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah \([[Dan.1.6|Daniel 1:6]]-7\). Along with Daniel, Mishael \(Meshach\), and Azariah \(Abednego\), Hananiah was chosen to serve in Nebuchadnezzar's court. They were given new names and trained in the language and literature of the Babylonians \(Daniel 1:4-5\). Hananiah and his friends remained faithful to God and refused to defile themselves with the king's food and wine \(Daniel 1:8-16\). God granted them knowledge, skill, and wisdom, and they excelled in their service to the king \(Daniel 1:17-20\). Later, when King Nebuchadnezzar erected a golden image and demanded that all people worship it, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah refused to comply \([[Dan.3.12|Daniel 3:12]]\). As a result, they were thrown into a fiery furnace, but God protected them, and they emerged unharmed \([[Dan.3.19|Daniel 3:19]]-27\). This event led Nebuchadnezzar to acknowledge the power of their God and promote them to higher positions in the province of Babylon \([[Dan.3.28|Daniel 3:28]]-30\). Hananiah's faith and courage in the face of persecution serve as an example of unwavering devotion to God.
