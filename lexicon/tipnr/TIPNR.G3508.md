Naphtali was the sixth son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and the second son of Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant \([[Gen.30.8|Genesis 30:8]]; 35:25\). His birth was celebrated by Rachel, who had been struggling with infertility. She named him Naphtali, saying, "With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister and have prevailed" \([[Gen.30.8|Genesis 30:8]]\). 

As one of the twelve tribes of Israel, Naphtali played a significant role in the history of God's chosen people. During the Exodus, the tribe of Naphtali was led by Ahira son of Enan \([[Num.1.15|Numbers 1:15]]\) and was counted among the Israelite tribes in the wilderness \([[Num.1.42|Numbers 1:42]]-43; 26:48-50\). 

In the arrangement of the Israelite camp, Naphtali was positioned on the north side, along with the tribes of Dan and Asher \(Numbers 2:29\). The tribe also had representatives among the twelve spies sent to explore Canaan \([[Num.13.14|Numbers 13:14]]\) and had a designated leader, Pedahel son of Ammihud, during the allocation of the Promised Land \([[Num.34.28|Numbers 34:28]]\). 

The territory allotted to the tribe of Naphtali was in the northern part of Canaan, bordering Asher, Zebulun, and Issachar \(Joshua 19:32-39\). The region was known for its fertile lands and abundant resources, as reflected in Jacob's blessing: "Naphtali is a doe let loose that bears beautiful fawns" \([[Gen.49.21|Genesis 49:21]]\) and Moses' blessing: "Naphtali is abounding with the favor of the Lord and is full of his blessing; he will inherit southward to the lake" \(Deuteronomy 33:23\). 

Throughout Israel's history, the tribe of Naphtali played various roles. They participated in the battles against Sisera \(Judges 4:6, 10; 5:18\) and the Midianites \([[Judg.6.35|Judges 6:35]]; 7:23\). The tribe also provided skilled warriors to support David \([[1Chr.12.34|1 Chronicles 12:34]], 40\) and was known for its wise and articulate people \([[Judg.5.18|Judges 5:18]]; Psalm 68:27\). 

In the New Testament, Naphtali is mentioned in connection with Jesus' ministry in the region of Galilee \([[Matt.4.13|Matthew 4:13]], 15\), fulfilling the prophecy of [[Isa.9.1|Isaiah 9:1]]. The tribe is also listed among the twelve tribes of Israel sealed by God in the book of Revelation \([[Rev.7.6|Revelation 7:6]]\).
