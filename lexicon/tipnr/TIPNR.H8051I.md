Shammua, mentioned in [[Neh.12.18|Nehemiah 12:18]], was a priest who served during the time of Nehemiah, a key figure in the rebuilding of Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. Shammua is listed among the priests who were heads of their fathers' houses during the days of Joiakim, the high priest. This suggests that Shammua held a leadership position within the priestly community. The text does not provide any specific details about Shammua's role or his contributions to the religious life of the community. However, his inclusion in the list of priests highlights the importance of the priestly lineage and their service in the temple. The priests were responsible for maintaining the religious practices, offering sacrifices, and teaching the people the law of God. Shammua's presence in this list indicates his participation in these sacred duties and his commitment to the spiritual well-being of the community during the post-exilic period.
