Jamin is mentioned in [[Neh.8.7|Nehemiah 8:7]] as one of the Levites who helped explain the Law to the people during the time of Ezra and Nehemiah. After the return from the Babylonian exile, Ezra the scribe read the Book of the Law to the assembled Israelites during the Feast of Tabernacles. As he read, the Levites, including Jamin, helped the people understand the Law by translating and interpreting it for them. This event marked a significant moment in the spiritual reformation of the Israelites as they recommitted themselves to following God's commandments. The text does not provide any further details about Jamin's life or his specific role among the Levites.
