The Ascent of Ziz is mentioned in the Bible as the location where King Jehoshaphat of Judah faced the invading armies of Moab, Ammon, and Mount Seir \([[2Chr.20.16|2Ch.20.16]]\). As Jehoshaphat and his people sought the Lord and praised Him, the Lord set ambushes against the invading armies, causing them to destroy one another \(2Ch.20:22-23\). The Ascent of Ziz was likely a pass or route leading up from the Dead Sea region towards Tekoa and the hill country of Judah. Its exact location is uncertain.
