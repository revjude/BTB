- referred to as Ariel or "hero" \(KJV= "lionlike men, NIV= "mightiest warriors""\) <[[H0739]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>ֲ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יא</span>ֵ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>\).

In [[2Sam.23.20|2 Samuel 23:20]] and [[1Chr.11.22|1 Chronicles 11:22]], the term "Ariel" is used to describe two warriors from Moab who were killed by Benaiah, one of King David's mighty men. The passage states that Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was a valiant fighter from Kabzeel who performed great exploits. Among his notable achievements, he struck down two "Ariel" of Moab. 

The term "Ariel" in this context is not a proper name but rather a descriptive term meaning "lion of God" or "lion-like." It is used to emphasize the strength, courage, and ferocity of these Moabite warriors. The fact that Benaiah defeated two of these formidable fighters highlights his exceptional skill and bravery as a warrior in David's army. 

Apart from this brief mention, no further details are provided about the identity, background, or specific circumstances surrounding Benaiah's encounter with these Moabite warriors. The passage serves to showcase Benaiah's prowess and loyalty to King David, as well as to illustrate the might of David's elite group of warriors known as "The Thirty."
