Naamah was a town in the Judean lowlands, also known as the Shephelah \(Josh. 15:41\). It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the list of towns allotted to the tribe of Judah. The exact location of Naamah is unknown, but it was situated in the western foothills of Judah, between the coastal plain and the Judean mountains.
