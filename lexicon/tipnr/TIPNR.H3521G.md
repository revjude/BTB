Cabul was a town located on the border of the territory allotted to the tribe of Asher \([[Josh.19.27|Joshua 19:27]]\). It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the description of Asher's boundaries. The town was situated in the western part of Galilee, near the Mediterranean coast. No other details are provided about Cabul's history, size, or significance. Its exact location is uncertain, but it may be associated with the modern village of Kabul, located approximately 9 miles \(15 kilometers\) southeast of Acre.
