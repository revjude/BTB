Maon was a city located in the hill country of Judah \([[Josh.15.55|Joshua 15:55]]\), south of Hebron. It is best known as the hometown of Nabal, the wealthy but foolish man who refused to help David and his men \([[1Sam.25.2|1 Samuel 25:2]]\). Nabal's wife, Abigail, interceded on his behalf and provided food for David's men, preventing David from taking revenge on Nabal \(1 Samuel 25:18-35\). After Nabal's death, David married Abigail \(1 Samuel 25:39-42\). Maon is also mentioned as one of the places where David and his men sought refuge from King Saul \([[1Sam.23.24|1 Samuel 23:24]]-25\). The wilderness of Maon, located near the city, was one of the areas where David hid from Saul. Additionally, the Maonites are listed among the oppressors of Israel during the time of the judges \([[Judg.10.12|Judges 10:12]]\).
