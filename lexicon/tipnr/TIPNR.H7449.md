Resen is mentioned in the Bible as one of the cities built by Nimrod, the great hunter and ruler, in Assyria. It was located between the cities of Nineveh and Calah \(Gen. 10:12\). The description "a great city" likely refers to Nineveh, not Resen. No other details are provided about Resen in the Bible. Its exact location is unknown, but it was likely situated in the region of ancient Assyria, in modern-day northern Iraq.
