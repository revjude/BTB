Aaron was the older brother of Moses and Miriam, from the tribe of Levi. God appointed Aaron to be Moses' spokesman when Moses was called to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. Aaron performed signs before Pharaoh, including turning his staff into a snake. He assisted Moses during the Exodus, including holding up Moses' arms during the battle against the Amalekites. 

God chose Aaron and his descendants to serve as priests for the Israelites. Aaron was consecrated as the first high priest and wore special priestly garments. He was responsible for offering sacrifices, burning incense, and performing other priestly duties in the tabernacle. Aaron also played a role in several significant events, such as the golden calf incident and the rebellion of Korah. 

Aaron married Elisheba, and they had four sons: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. Nadab and Abihu died when they offered unauthorized fire before the Lord. Aaron died at the age of 123 on Mount Hor, and his son Eleazar succeeded him as high priest. Despite his flaws, Aaron was a key figure in Israel's history and played a crucial role in establishing the priesthood.
