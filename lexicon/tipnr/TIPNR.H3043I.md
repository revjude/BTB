Jediael is mentioned in [[1Chr.12.20|1 Chronicles 12:20]] as one of the Manassites who joined David at Ziklag when he was seeking refuge from King Saul. During this time, David was gathering support from various tribes as he was being pursued by Saul, who sought to kill him. The Manassites, including Jediael, are described as defecting to David and offering their support. They are characterized as brave warriors, commanders of thousands in Manasseh, who provided valuable military assistance to David. The text does not provide any further details about Jediael's specific role or actions during this period. However, his presence among the Manassites who allied with David suggests that he was a loyal and capable warrior who recognized David as the rightful king of Israel.
