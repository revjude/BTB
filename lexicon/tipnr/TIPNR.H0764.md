Armoni was one of the two sons of King Saul of Israel by his concubine Rizpah, daughter of Aiah. After Saul's death, to avert a famine, David handed over Armoni and his brother Mephibosheth to the Gibeonites, who killed them in retribution for Saul's earlier attempt to annihilate the Gibeonites. Their bodies were left exposed until Rizpah took sackcloth and spread it on a rock, keeping the birds and wild animals away, until David had their bones buried in Saul's family tomb.
