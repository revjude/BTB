- A king of Northern Israel, living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Kgs.15.10|2Ki.15.10]]; 
- only referred to as Shallum **<big>[[H7967|שַׁלּוּם]]</big>**; 
- a son of Jabesh **<big>[[H3003|יָבֵשׁ]]</big>**.

Shallum, mentioned in [[2Kgs.15.10|2 Kings 15:10]]-15, was the son of Jabesh who became the king of Israel after conspiring against and assassinating Zechariah, the previous king. Zechariah, the son of Jeroboam II, had reigned over Israel for only six months before Shallum killed him and took the throne. Shallum's reign, however, was short-lived, lasting only one month. Menahem, the son of Gadi, rose up against Shallum, attacked and killed him in Samaria, and succeeded him as king. The conspiracy and assassination carried out by Shallum reflect the political instability and violence that characterized the later years of the northern kingdom of Israel. Shallum's brief reign and his own demise demonstrate the tumultuous nature of the monarchy during this period.
