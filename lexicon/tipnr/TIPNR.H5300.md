The Nephushesim \(also known as Nephisim\) are mentioned in [[Neh.7.52|Nehemiah 7:52]] and [[Ezra.2.50|Ezra 2:50]] as one of the families of temple servants who returned to Jerusalem from Babylonian exile. The temple servants, also known as Nethinim, were a group of individuals assigned to assist the Levites in the maintenance and operation of the temple. 

The Nephushesim are listed among the returnees who accompanied Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, back to Jerusalem following the decree of King Cyrus of Persia, which allowed the Jews to return to their homeland and rebuild the temple \(Ezra 1:1-4\). 

Although the exact origins and duties of the Nephushesim are not specified in the biblical text, their inclusion in the list of returning exiles suggests that they played a role in the restoration of temple worship in Jerusalem. As temple servants, they would have been responsible for various tasks, such as preparing materials for sacrifices, maintaining the temple grounds, and assisting the Levites in their duties. 

The mention of the Nephushesim in both Ezra and Nehemiah's accounts of the returned exiles highlights the importance of all members of the Jewish community, including those who served in seemingly minor roles, in the restoration of religious life in post-exilic Judah. Their presence in the record also demonstrates God's faithfulness in preserving and bringing back His people to their land and to the service of the temple.
