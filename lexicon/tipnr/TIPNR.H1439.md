- a son of Joash **<big>[[H3101|יוֹאָשׁ]]</big>**;

Gideon, also known as Jerubbaal or Jerubbesheth, was a judge of Israel during the period of the judges, as recorded in the book of Judges, chapters 6-8. He is also mentioned in [[Heb.11.32|Hebrews 11:32]] as an example of faith. Gideon was the son of Joash, from the clan of Abiezer in the tribe of Manasseh \([[Judg.6.11|Judges 6:11]], 15\). During a time when Israel was oppressed by the Midianites, God called Gideon to deliver His people \(Judges 6:14\). Gideon initially doubted his ability to save Israel, but God reassured him through various signs, including a fleece wet with dew \([[Judg.6.36|Judges 6:36]]-40\). Gideon destroyed the altar of Baal and the Asherah pole, earning him the name Jerubbaal, which means "let Baal contend against him" \(Judges 6:25-32\). 

With a reduced army of 300 men, chosen by God, Gideon defeated the Midianites through a surprise attack, using trumpets, empty jars, and torches \([[Judg.7.1|Judges 7:1]]-25\). He pursued the Midianite kings, Zebah and Zalmunna, and captured them \([[Judg.8.4|Judges 8:4]]-21\). After the victory, the Israelites asked Gideon to rule over them, but he refused, stating that only God should rule over Israel \([[Judg.8.22|Judges 8:22]]-23\). However, Gideon made an ephod from the gold taken from the Midianites, which became a snare to him and his family \([[Judg.8.24|Judges 8:24]]-27\). 

Gideon had seventy sons and many wives, including a concubine from Shechem who bore him a son named Abimelech \([[Judg.8.29|Judges 8:29]]-31\). After Gideon's death, Abimelech killed his seventy brothers and became king of Shechem, but his rule was short-lived and ended in his death \(Judges 9\). Gideon is remembered as a deliverer of Israel, and his story is referenced in [[1Sam.12.11|1 Samuel 12:11]] and [[2Sam.11.21|2 Samuel 11:21]]. The name Jerubbesheth \([[2Sam.11.21|2 Samuel 11:21]]\) is a variation of Jerubbaal, with "besheth" \(meaning "shame"\) replacing "baal" to avoid using the name of the pagan god.
