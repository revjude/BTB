Hannah was the wife of Elkanah, an Ephraimite, and the mother of the prophet Samuel \(1 Samuel 1:1-2\). She was one of Elkanah's two wives, the other being Peninnah. While Peninnah had children, Hannah was barren, which caused her great distress \(1 Samuel 1:2, 6-7\). During an annual visit to the tabernacle at Shiloh, Hannah prayed fervently to the Lord, asking for a son and vowing to dedicate him to the Lord's service \([[1Sam.1.9|1 Samuel 1:9]]-11\). Eli, the high priest, initially mistook her intense prayer for drunkenness but later blessed her when he understood her situation \(1 Samuel 1:12-18\). In due time, Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son, whom she named Samuel, meaning "heard by God" \([[1Sam.1.19|1 Samuel 1:19]]-20\). After weaning him, Hannah fulfilled her vow and brought Samuel to the tabernacle to serve under Eli \(1 Samuel 1:24-28\). Hannah's prayer of thanksgiving \([[1Sam.2.1|1 Samuel 2:1]]-10\) expresses her joy and gratitude for God's answer to her prayers and her recognition of God's sovereignty. The Bible also records that Hannah had three more sons and two daughters after dedicating Samuel to the Lord \([[1Sam.2.21|1 Samuel 2:21]]\). Hannah's story illustrates the power of prayer, faith, and dedication to God.
