Allon, meaning "oak" or "terebinth," is mentioned in [[Josh.19.33|Joshua 19:33]] as a boundary marker for the territory allotted to the tribe of Naphtali. It is described as being located near Zaanannim, which is also associated with an oak or terebinth tree. The reference to Allon in the context of Naphtali's territorial boundaries suggests that it was a prominent tree or grove that served as a recognizable landmark. In ancient times, large trees were often used as meeting places, sacred sites, or boundary markers. The exact location of Allon is not specified, but it was likely situated in the hill country of Galilee, within the territory of Naphtali.
