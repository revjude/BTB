Lamech was the son of Methuselah and the father of Noah \([[Gen.5.25|Gen.5.25]],28-29\). He was born when Methuselah was 187 years old \([[Gen.5.25|Gen.5.25]]\). Lamech named his son Noah, saying, "This one will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the Lord has cursed" \(Gen.5.29\). Lamech lived 595 years after the birth of Noah and had other sons and daughters \([[Gen.5.30|Gen.5.30]]\). He died at the age of 777, making him the second-oldest person mentioned in the Bible after his father, Methuselah \([[Gen.5.31|Gen.5.31]]\). Lamech is also mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus Christ in the Gospel of Luke \(Lk.3.36\) and in the genealogy of Adam in the book of Chronicles \([[1Chr.1.3|1Ch.1.3]]\). His life and legacy are significant in the context of the pre-flood world and the lineage of the patriarchs leading to Noah.
