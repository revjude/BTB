Ziph was a town in the hill country of Judah, southeast of Hebron \([[Josh.15.55|Jos.15.55]]\). The wilderness near Ziph was where David hid from King Saul \([[1Sam.23.14|1Sa.23.14]]-15\). On two occasions, the Ziphites informed Saul of David's whereabouts \([[1Sam.23.19|1Sa.23.19]]; 26:1\). In the wilderness of Ziph, David spared Saul's life when he had the opportunity to kill him \(1Sa.26:2-12\). The town of Ziph is probably to be identified with Tell Zif, about 4 miles southeast of Hebron. Ruins have been found there, along with a spring. Psalm 54 is associated with David's time hiding from Saul in the region of Ziph.
