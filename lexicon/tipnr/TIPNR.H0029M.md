Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Abijah</span> was one of the priests who sealed the covenant during Nehemiah's time and was also listed among the priests who returned from the Babylonian exile.
- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Neh.10.7|Neh.10.7]]; 
- only referred to as Abijah **<big>[[H0029|אֲבִיָּה]]</big>**.

Abijah is mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as one of the priests who sealed the covenant made by the people of Israel to follow God's law \([[Neh.10.7|Nehemiah 10:7]]\). This covenant was made during the time of Nehemiah, who led the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. 

Abijah is also listed among the priests who returned from the Babylonian exile \([[Neh.12.4|Nehemiah 12:4]]\). In [[Neh.12.17|Nehemiah 12:17]], he is mentioned as the head of a priestly family during the time of Joiakim, the high priest. This suggests that Abijah and his descendants continued to serve as priests in the restored community of Israel after the exile. 

The mention of Abijah in these passages highlights the importance of the priestly role in the spiritual life of Israel, both in the rebuilding of the temple and in the renewal of the covenant with God.
