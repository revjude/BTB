James was one of the brothers of Jesus, along with Joses, Judas, and Simon \([[Matt.13.55|Matthew 13:55]]; [[Mark.6.3|Mark 6:3]]\). During Jesus' ministry, James and his brothers did not believe in Him \(John 7:5\). However, after Jesus' resurrection, James became a believer and a prominent leader in the early church in Jerusalem. He was one of the individuals to whom Jesus appeared after His resurrection \([[1Cor.15.7|1 Corinthians 15:7]]\). In the early church, James played a significant role in the Jerusalem Council, which addressed the issue of Gentile believers and the Mosaic Law \(Acts 15:13-21\). He also received Paul and his companions during their visits to Jerusalem \(Acts 21:18; [[Gal.1.19|Galatians 1:19]]; 2:9\). James authored the New Testament epistle that bears his name, in which he emphasizes practical faith and good works \([[Jas.1.1|James 1:1]]\). He is often referred to as "James the Just" due to his reputation for righteousness and his strict observance of the Jewish law. According to early church tradition, James was martyred in Jerusalem around 62 AD.
