Azriel is mentioned in [[Jer.36.26|Jeremiah 36:26]] as one of the officials sent by King Jehoiakim to arrest the prophet Jeremiah and his scribe, Baruch. The chapter describes how Jeremiah had dictated a prophecy to Baruch, warning of the impending judgment on Judah, and Baruch had read the scroll in the temple. When King Jehoiakim heard the words of the prophecy, he burned the scroll and ordered the arrest of Jeremiah and Baruch. Azriel, along with two other officials, Jerahmeel and Shelemiah, was tasked with carrying out this order. However, the text notes that the Lord had hidden Jeremiah and Baruch, and they were not found. The incident highlights the opposition and persecution faced by Jeremiah in delivering God's message to a rebellious nation and the protection provided by God for his faithful servants.
