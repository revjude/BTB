Beth-hoglah, meaning "house of the partridge" in Hebrew, was a town located on the border between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. It is mentioned three times in the book of Joshua, always in the context of defining the boundaries of these two tribes. 

In [[Josh.15.6|Joshua 15:6]], Beth-hoglah is described as being part of the northern border of Judah, near the end of the Salt Sea \(Dead Sea\). The border went up to Beth-hoglah and passed north of it, indicating that the town itself was within Judah's territory. 

In [[Josh.18.19|Joshua 18:19]] and 21, Beth-hoglah is listed among the cities allotted to the tribe of Benjamin. The border of Benjamin is described as passing south of Beth-hoglah, confirming its location on the boundary between the two tribes. 

The exact location of Beth-hoglah is not specified in the Bible, but based on the descriptions in Joshua, it was likely situated in the Jordan Valley, near the northern end of the Dead Sea. Its proximity to the Dead Sea and its location on the border between Judah and Benjamin suggest that it may have been an important town for trade, agriculture, or defense. 

The name "house of the partridge" may refer to the presence of these birds in the area or to a local feature that resembled a partridge. Partridges were common in the region.
