<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Phoebe</span>, a deacon of the church in Cenchreae, whom Paul commended to the believers in Rome.
- A woman living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Rom.16.1|Rom.16.1]]; 
- referred to as Phoebe or \[ \] \(KJV= Phebe\) <[[G5402]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Φοίβη</span>\).

Phoebe was a prominent woman in the early Christian church, mentioned by Paul in his letter to the Romans \([[Rom.16.1|Romans 16:1]]-2\). She was a deacon \(or servant\) of the church in Cenchreae, a port city near Corinth. Paul described her as a "sister" and a "patron" or "benefactor" of many, including Paul himself. This suggests that Phoebe was a woman of means who used her resources to support the ministry of the church and traveling missionaries like Paul. 

It is likely that Phoebe was the one who delivered Paul's letter to the Romans, as Paul commended her to the believers in Rome and asked them to receive her in a manner worthy of the saints and to assist her in whatever she needed. This demonstrates the trust Paul had in Phoebe and her role in the early church. 

As a deacon, Phoebe would have been responsible for various forms of service and ministry within the church, possibly including charitable work, hospitality, and spiritual guidance. Her example highlights the significant contributions of women in the early spread of Christianity and their active roles in the life of the church.
