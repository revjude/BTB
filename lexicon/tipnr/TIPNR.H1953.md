<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Hoshama</span> was a descendant of Jeconiah, the exiled king of Judah, according to the genealogy in 1 Chronicles.
- A man from the tribe of Judah living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.3.18|1Ch.3.18]]; 
- only referred to as Hoshama<[[H1953]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>הו</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ש</span>ָׁ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>מ</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>\); 
-  son of Shealtiel<[[H7597A]]>\(?\); 
- a brother of Malchiram<[[H4443]]>, Pedaiah<[[H6305H]]>, Shenazzar<[[H8137]]>, Jekamiah<[[H3359H]]> and Nedabiah<[[H5072]]>.

Hoshama is mentioned in [[1Chr.3.18|1 Chronicles 3:18]] as one of the descendant of Jeconiah, the king of Judah who was exiled to Babylon. Jeconiah, also known as Jehoiachin, though the genealogy is complex. He was taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar in 597 BC and spent many years in captivity \(2 Kings 24:10-16\). 

The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 3 lists the descendants of Jeconiah, including Hoshama and his brothers, Shealtiel, Malkiram, Pedaiah, Shenazzar, Jekamiah, and Nedabiah. This record demonstrates that despite Jeconiah's exile and the judgment pronounced upon him \(Jeremiah 22:24-30\), his lineage continued, and he had several sons. 

His inclusion in the genealogy suggests that he was part of the royal line of David and that the family maintained some level of identity and cohesion even during the Babylonian captivity.
