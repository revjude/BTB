Iconium was a city in Asia Minor \(modern-day Turkey\) that was visited by the apostle Paul during his missionary journeys. After being forced to leave Antioch in Pisidia, Paul and Barnabas went to Iconium, where they preached in the synagogue and many Jews and Gentiles believed \(Acts 13:51; 14:1\). However, the unbelieving Jews stirred up opposition, and Paul and Barnabas had to flee to Lystra and Derbe \(Acts 14:19, 21\). Later, Paul revisited Iconium to strengthen the disciples \(Acts 16:2\). In his letter to Timothy, Paul mentions the persecutions he endured in Iconium \([[2Tim.3.11|2 Timothy 3:11]]\). Iconium was located in the region of Lycaonia and was an important city in the Roman province of Galatia. Today, it is known as Konya, Turkey.
