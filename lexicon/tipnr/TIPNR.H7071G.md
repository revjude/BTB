The Brook of Kanah was a stream that served as a boundary marker between the tribal territories of Ephraim and Manasseh \([[Josh.16.8|Joshua 16:8]]; 17:9\). It flowed in the region of the hill country of Ephraim, likely emptying into the Mediterranean Sea. The brook is mentioned twice in the book of Joshua as part of the description of the allotted territories for the tribes of Joseph's sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. Its exact location is not certain, but it is believed to be one of the streams in the modern-day Wadi Qana, located in the western part of the Samarian hills.
