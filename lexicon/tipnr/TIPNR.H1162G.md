Boaz was a wealthy man from Bethlehem who played a significant role in the story of Ruth \(Ruth 2-4\). He was a relative of Naomi's deceased husband, Elimelech, and acted as a kinsman-redeemer for Ruth, a Moabite widow. When Ruth gleaned grain in Boaz's field, he showed her kindness and protection, recognizing her loyalty to Naomi \(Ruth 2\). Later, Naomi instructed Ruth to approach Boaz at night and request that he fulfill his role as a kinsman-redeemer \(Ruth 3\). Boaz agreed to marry Ruth, after ensuring that a closer relative did not wish to claim this right \(Ruth 4:1-12\). Their marriage led to the birth of Obed, who became the grandfather of King David \(Ruth 4:13-17\). Boaz is also mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus Christ \(Matt. 1:5; [[Luke.3.32|Luke 3:32]]\), highlighting his importance in God's plan of redemption. Additionally, Boaz is associated with one of the two bronze pillars in Solomon's temple, which was named after him \([[1Kgs.7.21|1 Kings 7:21]]; 1 Chr. 2:11-12\). His story demonstrates the importance of integrity, kindness, and faithfulness in fulfilling one's duties and God's purposes.
