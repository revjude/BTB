- A man from the tribe of Levi  living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[1Chr.9.15|1Ch.9.15]]; 
- only referred to as Asaph **<big>[[H0623|אָסָף]]</big>**;

Asaph is mentioned in the lists of Levites who resettled in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile, recorded in 1 Chronicles 9 and Nehemiah 11. He is described as a descendant of Gershom, one of the sons of Levi. In the parallel passage in Nehemiah, he is called "Zabdi the son of Asaph." These lists highlight the importance of the Levites in restoring worship and community life in Jerusalem after the exile. As a Levite descendant living in Jerusalem, Asaph would have likely been involved in the various duties and responsibilities assigned to the Levites in the post-exilic period.
