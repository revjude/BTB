Gimzo was a city located in the plain of Judah, known for its abundance of sycamore trees. During the reign of King Ahaz of Judah, the Philistines attacked and captured Gimzo, along with its surrounding villages \([[2Chr.28.18|2 Chronicles 28:18]]\). This event occurred in the context of Ahaz's unfaithfulness to God and his refusal to seek divine help, which led to various military defeats and losses of territory. The capture of Gimzo by the Philistines demonstrates the vulnerability of Judah's cities and the consequences of the king's disobedience. Apart from this single reference, no further details about Gimzo's history or significance are provided in the Bible. The city is believed to be located at the site of modern-day Jimzu, approximately 3 miles southeast of Lydda.
