Ashtaroth, also known as Beeshterah, was a city located in the region of Bashan, east of the Jordan River. It is mentioned several times in the Bible, particularly in connection with Og, the king of Bashan, who ruled over the city. 

In Deuteronomy 1:4, Ashtaroth is named as one of the cities defeated by the Israelites, along with Edrei, after they had conquered Sihon, king of the Amorites. [[Josh.9.10|Joshua 9:10]] and 12:4 also mention Ashtaroth as part of the territory ruled by Og, who was one of the last remnants of the Rephaim, a race of giants. 

After the conquest of Bashan, Ashtaroth was allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh \([[Josh.13.31|Joshua 13:31]]\). However, the city was later designated as a Levitical city, given to the descendants of Gershon \([[Josh.21.27|Joshua 21:27]]; [[1Chr.6.71|1 Chronicles 6:71]]\). This indicates that Ashtaroth was one of the cities set apart for the Levites to dwell in and perform their sacred duties. 

In [[1Chr.11.44|1 Chronicles 11:44]], Ashtaroth is mentioned as the hometown of Uzzia, one of David's mighty men, suggesting that the city had Israelite inhabitants during the time of David's reign. 

The name Ashtaroth is also associated with the Canaanite goddess Astarte, and it is possible that the city was a center of her worship before the Israelite conquest. The biblical writers often used the name Ashtaroth to refer to the goddess herself or to the plural form of Astarte, representing multiple goddesses or idols. 

The city of Ashtaroth was strategically located in the fertile region of Bashan, known for its rich pastures and livestock. Its mention in the Bible highlights the Israelites' victories over the powerful kings of the region and the allotment of the conquered territories to the tribes of Israel, including the Levites.
