- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.11.47|1Ch.11.47]];

Jaasiel, the son of Abner, is mentioned in [[1Chr.11.47|1 Chronicles 11:47]] as one of David's mighty warriors. He is listed among the warriors who came to David at Ziklag and helped him in his battles against the raiders \(1Ch.12.1-7\). 

The fact that Jaasiel is identified as the son of Abner suggests that he may have been related to Saul's military commander, Abner, who initially opposed David but later supported him \(2Sa.3.6-21\). However, the text does not provide any further details about this relationship or Jaasiel's background. 

As one of David's mighty warriors, Jaasiel would have been known for his bravery, skill in battle, and loyalty to the king. These warriors played a crucial role in establishing and defending David's kingdom against various enemies. 

No other information is given about Jaasiel's specific exploits or his role in David's army. His inclusion in this list highlights the diverse group of warriors who supported David and contributed to his success as a military leader and king.
