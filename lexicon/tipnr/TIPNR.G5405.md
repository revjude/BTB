Phoenix, also known as Phoenice, was a harbor on the southern coast of the island of Crete, mentioned in the account of Paul's journey to Rome as a prisoner \(Acts 27:12\). During the voyage, the ship encountered a severe storm, and the crew debated whether to stay at the port of Fair Havens or sail to Phoenix to spend the winter \(Acts 27:8-12\). The majority decided to attempt the journey to Phoenix, as it was considered a more suitable harbor to winter in \(Acts 27:12\). However, before they could reach Phoenix, a violent wind drove the ship off course, ultimately leading to its shipwreck on the island of Malta \(Acts 27:13-44\). The exact location of Phoenix is not certain, but it is believed to have been situated on the southwestern coast of Crete, possibly near the modern-day town of Loutro or the village of Phiniki.
