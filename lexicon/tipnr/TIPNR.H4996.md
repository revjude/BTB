Thebes, also known as No-amon \(Nah. 3:8\), was an ancient Egyptian city located in Upper Egypt, known for its wealth, power, and religious significance. It was the capital of Egypt during the New Kingdom period \(1550-1070 BC\). The city is mentioned in several prophetic passages in the Bible, primarily in the context of God's judgment against Egypt. Jeremiah prophesied that God would punish Amon, the chief deity of Thebes, along with Pharaoh and the people who trusted in him \(Jer. 46:25\). Ezekiel foretold the destruction of Thebes, stating that God would execute judgments against the city \(Ezek. 30:14-16\). Nahum used Thebes as an example of a mighty city that fell despite its strength and allies, comparing it to Nineveh \(Nah. 3:8-10\). The biblical references to Thebes highlight its prominence and influence in ancient times, as well as its vulnerability to God's judgment.
