Levite living at the time of Exile and Return

The descendants of <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Immer</span> were a priestly family who lived in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile, as recorded in 1 Chronicles and Nehemiah.
- A priest from the tribe of Levi  living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[1Chr.9.12|1Ch.9.12]]; 
- only referred to as Immer **<big>[[H0564|אִמֵּר]]</big>**; 
-  father of Meshillemith **<big>[[H4921|מְשִׁלֵּמִית]]</big>**.

Immer is mentioned in [[1Chr.9.12|1 Chronicles 9:12]] and [[Neh.11.13|Nehemiah 11:13]] as the name of a priestly family that lived in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. The Immerites were among the priests who returned to Jerusalem and helped to rebuild the city and restore the temple worship. 

In 1 Chronicles 9, the descendants of Immer are listed among the priests who settled in Jerusalem. The passage mentions Adaiah, son of Jeroham, son of Pashhur, son of Malchijah, from the sons of Immer, who was one of the chief officials in the house of God \([[1Chr.9.12|1 Chronicles 9:12]]\). 

Similarly, in Nehemiah 11, which records the resettlement of Jerusalem after the exile, the descendants of Immer are again mentioned among the priests. The passage lists Amashsai, son of Azarel, son of Ahzai, son of Meshillemoth, son of Immer \([[Neh.11.13|Nehemiah 11:13]]\). 

The repeated mention of the Immerites in the post-exilic records suggests that they were a significant priestly family who played a role in the restoration of Jerusalem and the temple. As priests, they would have been responsible for conducting the temple services, offering sacrifices, and teaching the people the Law of God. 

The fact that the Immerites are mentioned alongside other prominent priestly families, such as the descendants of Jedaiah and Jachin, indicates that they held a respected position within the priestly community. 

The name Immer means "he has said" or "he has spoken" in Hebrew, possibly reflecting the family's role in speaking and teaching the word of God to the people.
