-  son of Zerubbabel<[[H2216]]>; 
- a brother of Meshullam<[[H4918H]]>, Hananiah<[[H2608L]]>, Shelomith<[[H8019I]]>, Hashubah<[[H2807]]>, Ohel<[[H0169]]>, Berechiah<[[H1296G]]>, Hasadiah<[[H2619]]> and Abiud<[[G0010]]>.

Jushab-hesed is mentioned in [[1Chr.3.20|1 Chronicles 3:20]] as one of the sons of Zerubbabel, a descendant of King Jehoiachin of Judah. The context of the passage is the genealogy of the royal line of David, focusing on the descendants of Jehoiachin after the Babylonian exile \(1 Chronicles 3:17-24\). 

Jushab-hesed is listed along with his brothers: Meshullam, Hananiah, Shelomith \(their sister\), Hashubah, Ohel, Berechiah, Hasadiah, and Jushab-hesed \(1 Chronicles 3:19-20\). The repetition of Jushab-hesed's name in verse 20 has led some scholars to suggest that it may be a scribal error or that there were two individuals with the same name. 

As a descendant of Jehoiachin and Zerubbabel, Jushab-hesed would have been part of the royal lineage of David during the post-exilic period. However, no further information is provided about his life, role, or significance in the biblical narrative. 

The inclusion of Jushab-hesed in the genealogy of David's descendants demonstrates the continuity of the royal line and God's faithfulness to His promises to David, even through the difficult period of the Babylonian exile and its aftermath.
