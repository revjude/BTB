Kedar is first mentioned in [[Gen.25.13|Genesis 25:13]] and [[1Chr.1.29|1 Chronicles 1:29]] as one of the twelve sons of Ishmael, the son of Abraham. He is the eponymous ancestor of the Kedarites, a nomadic Arab tribe that inhabited the desert regions of northern Arabia. 

The Kedarites were known for their black tents \(Song of Solomon 1:5\) and their large flocks of sheep and goats \([[Isa.60.7|Isaiah 60:7]]; [[Ezek.27.21|Ezekiel 27:21]]\). They were skilled archers and warriors \([[Isa.21.16|Isaiah 21:16]]-17\) and were one of the major Arab tribes in the ancient Near East. 

In the Bible, Kedar is often used as a representation of the nomadic tribes of the desert. The psalmist laments living among the tents of Kedar, symbolizing a hostile and foreign environment \(Psalm 120:5\). The prophet Jeremiah uses Kedar as an example of a distant and powerful nation.
