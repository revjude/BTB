Amaziah was the son of Joash and the ninth king of Judah. He began his reign at the age of 25 and reigned for 29 years in Jerusalem. Amaziah did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, but not wholeheartedly like his ancestor David. He executed the officials who had murdered his father, but spared their children in obedience to the law of Moses. Amaziah also defeated the Edomites in battle, capturing Sela and renaming it Joktheel. However, he later challenged King Jehoash of Israel to battle and was defeated, resulting in the plundering of the temple and palace in Jerusalem. Amaziah outlived Jehoash by 15 years. He was eventually conspired against and killed in Lachish, and his son Uzziah succeeded him as king.
