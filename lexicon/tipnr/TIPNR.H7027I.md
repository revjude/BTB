- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[2Chr.29.12|2Ch.29.12]]; 
- only referred to as Kish **<big>[[H7027|קִישׁ]]</big>**; 
- a son of Abdi **<big>[[H5660|עַבְדִּי]]</big>**.

Kish is mentioned in [[2Chr.29.12|2 Chronicles 29:12]] as one of the Levites who participated in the purification of the temple during the reign of King Hezekiah. He is specifically identified as a descendant of Merari, one of the three main Levitical clans. 

The context of this passage is Hezekiah's reforms and his efforts to restore proper worship in Judah \(2 Chronicles 29:3-11\). As part of this restoration, Hezekiah called upon the Levites to sanctify themselves and cleanse the temple, which had fallen into disrepair and defilement during the reign of previous kings. 

Kish, along with other Levites from the clans of Kohath, Merari, and Gershon, responded to the king's command and took part in the purification process \([[2Chr.29.12|2 Chronicles 29:12]]-15\). They removed the unclean items from the temple, consecrated the utensils and furnishings, and prepared the temple for proper worship. 

The mention of Kish in this context highlights the importance of the Levites' role in maintaining the sanctity of the temple and their willingness to participate in the religious reforms initiated by King Hezekiah. It also demonstrates the cooperation between the king and the Levites in restoring proper worship practices in Judah.
