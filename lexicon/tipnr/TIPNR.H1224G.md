Bozrah was a prominent city in the land of Edom, located southeast of the Dead Sea. It served as the capital of Edom during the reign of King Jobab, son of Zerah \([[Gen.36.33|Genesis 36:33]], [[1Chr.1.44|1 Chronicles 1:44]]\). The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Amos mention Bozrah in their oracles of judgment against Edom \([[Isa.34.6|Isaiah 34:6]], 63:1; [[Jer.49.13|Jeremiah 49:13]], 22; Amos 1:12\). These prophecies depict Bozrah as a symbol of Edom's power and pride, which would be brought low by God's judgment. 

Isaiah's prophecy portrays God as a warrior coming from Bozrah with blood-stained garments, symbolizing His vengeance against Edom \([[Isa.63.1|Isaiah 63:1]]-6\). Jeremiah foretells that Bozrah would become a desolation and a curse, with its inhabitants fleeing in terror \([[Jer.49.13|Jeremiah 49:13]], 22\). Amos declares that God would send fire upon Bozrah, consuming its palaces \(Amos 1:12\). 

The exact location of Bozrah is uncertain, but it is believed to be near the modern town of Busaira in southern Jordan. It should not be confused with the Levitical city of Bezer, also called Bozrah, in the territory of Reuben \(Deuteronomy 4:43, Joshua 20:8\).
