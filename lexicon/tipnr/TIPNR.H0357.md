Aijalon was a city in the territory of the tribe of Dan, located in the Shephelah \(foothills\) region of Judah. It is most famously known as the place where Joshua commanded the moon to stand still during the battle against the Amorite kings \([[Josh.10.12|Joshua 10:12]]\). The city was allotted to the tribe of Dan \([[Josh.19.42|Joshua 19:42]]\) and later designated as a Levitical city for the Kohathites \([[Josh.21.24|Joshua 21:24]]; [[1Chr.6.69|1 Chronicles 6:69]]\). 

After the conquest of Canaan, the Amorites continued to dwell in Aijalon, and the Danites failed to drive them out completely \([[Judg.1.35|Judges 1:35]]\). Elon, a judge of Israel, was buried in Aijalon \([[Judg.12.12|Judges 12:12]]\). During Saul's reign, the Israelites pursued the Philistines as far as Aijalon \([[1Sam.14.31|1 Samuel 14:31]]\). Some descendants of Benjamin, including the family of Beriah, lived in Aijalon \([[1Chr.8.13|1 Chronicles 8:13]]\). 

King Rehoboam of Judah fortified Aijalon as part of his defensive strategy \([[2Chr.11.10|2 Chronicles 11:10]]\). Later, during the reign of King Ahaz, the Philistines captured Aijalon and settled there \([[2Chr.28.18|2 Chronicles 28:18]]\). The city is generally identified with the modern village of Yalo, about 13 miles \(21 km\) northwest of Jerusalem.
