Lachish was a significant fortified city located in the Shephelah region of Judah \([[Josh.15.39|Joshua 15:39]]\). It was one of the Amorite cities that formed an alliance against Joshua and the Israelites, but it was captured and its king was defeated \(Joshua 10; 12:11\). Later, Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, fortified Lachish as part of his defense strategy \([[2Chr.11.9|2 Chronicles 11:9]]\). During the reign of King Amaziah, Lachish served as a refuge for the king when he fled from a conspiracy in Jerusalem \(2 Kings 14:19; 2 Chronicles 25:27\). In the time of King Hezekiah, the Assyrian king Sennacherib captured Lachish and used it as a base to send his officials to threaten Jerusalem \([[2Kgs.18.14|2 Kings 18:14]], 17; 19:8; [[2Chr.32.9|2 Chronicles 32:9]]; [[Isa.36.2|Isaiah 36:2]]; 37:8\). The city was one of the last fortified cities in Judah to fall to the Babylonians during the reign of Zedekiah \([[Jer.34.7|Jeremiah 34:7]]\). After the Babylonian exile, Lachish was resettled by the people of Judah \([[Neh.11.30|Nehemiah 11:30]]\). The prophet Micah also mentioned Lachish, urging the city to give parting gifts to Moresheth-gath \([[Mic.1.13|Micah 1:13]]\).
