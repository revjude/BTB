An unnamed Aramitess is mentioned in the genealogy of the tribe of Manasseh, found in 1 Chronicles 7. She is described as a concubine of Manasseh, one of the sons of Joseph and a patriarch of one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The Aramitess gave birth to Asriel, who is listed among the descendants of Manasseh. The term "Aramitess" indicates that she was from Aram, a region in ancient Syria. Her inclusion in the genealogy suggests that intermarriage between the Israelites and the Arameans was not uncommon. Apart from this brief mention, no further information is provided about this Aramitess concubine of Manasseh in the biblical text.
