People from Letush\(?\)

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Letushim</span>, a son of Dedan and descendant of Abraham and Keturah \([[Gen.25.3|Gen.25.3]]\).
- People from Letush\(?\) of the Patriarchs, only mentioned at [[Gen.25.3|Gen.25.3]]; 
- only referred to as Letushim **<big>[[H3912|לְטוּשִׁם]]</big>**; 
- descended from Dedan **<big>[[H1719|דְּדָן]]</big>** along with Asshurim **<big>[[H0805|אֲשׁוּרִי]]</big>** and Leummim **<big>[[H3817|לְאֻמִּים]]</big>**.

Letushim was one of the sons of Dedan, who was a son of Jokshan, born to Abraham and his wife Keturah \([[Gen.25.3|Gen.25.3]]\). He is mentioned in the genealogy of Abraham's descendants through Keturah, which is recorded after the death of Sarah. The Letushim are listed among the descendants of Jokshan, along with the Asshurim and Leummim. No further information is provided about Letushim or his descendants in the biblical record. It is likely that they became a tribe or clan that settled in the region of Arabia, as many of Abraham's descendants through Keturah are associated with Arab tribes.
