Ammiel was the father of Machir, a man from Lo-debar who played a significant role in the life of King David. When David inquired about the whereabouts of Jonathan's son Mephibosheth, he was told that Mephibosheth was living in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar. Later, during Absalom's rebellion, when David fled from Jerusalem, Machir, along with Shobi and Barzillai, brought supplies to David and his people, including beds, basins, earthen vessels, wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils, honey, curds, sheep, and cheese.
