Tiphsah is mentioned in [[1Kgs.4.24|1 Kings 4:24]] as one of the boundary points of Solomon's kingdom, which extended from Tiphsah to Gaza. The city was located on the western bank of the Euphrates River, in the region of northern Syria or southern Turkey. Its inclusion in the description of Solomon's realm demonstrates the vast extent of his dominion and influence during the height of his reign. Tiphsah's strategic position on the Euphrates made it an important trade and military center, allowing Solomon to control the major trade routes between Mesopotamia and the Levant. The city's location also underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would possess the land from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates \(Gen. 15:18\).
