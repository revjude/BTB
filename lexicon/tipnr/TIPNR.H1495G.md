Gazez, mentioned in 1 Chronicles 2:46, was a son of Caleb and his concubine Ephah. This Gazez is distinguished from the Gazez who was the son of Haran, Caleb's grandson. The passage states that Ephah, Caleb's concubine, bore him three sons: Haran, Moza, and Gazez. It then clarifies that Haran was the father of the previously mentioned Gazez. This suggests that Caleb named one of his own sons after his grandson. The practice of concubinage, as seen in this passage, was common in ancient Israelite society, particularly among wealthy and influential men like Caleb. The sons born to concubines were considered legitimate heirs, although they may have had a lower status compared to the sons of the primary wife. The mention of Gazez and his brothers in the genealogical record of Judah emphasizes the importance of family lineage and the complex family structures that existed in ancient Israel.
