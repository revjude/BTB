Cenchreae was a seaport located on the eastern side of the Isthmus of Corinth, about seven miles from the city of Corinth. It served as the port for Corinth's trade with Asia Minor and the East. Cenchreae is mentioned twice in the Bible, both in connection with Paul's ministry. 

In Acts 18:18, Paul departed from Corinth and sailed from Cenchreae to Syria, after having his hair cut due to a vow he had taken. This vow was likely a Nazirite vow \(Numbers 6:1-21\), which involved abstaining from cutting one's hair until the vow was completed. Paul's actions at Cenchreae indicate his continued observance of Jewish customs and his commitment to his Jewish heritage. 

In [[Rom.16.1|Romans 16:1]]-2, Paul commends Phoebe, a deaconess of the church in Cenchreae, to the believers in Rome. He describes her as a servant of the church and a benefactor to many, including Paul himself. This passage provides insight into the role of women in the early church and their significant contributions to the spread of the gospel.
