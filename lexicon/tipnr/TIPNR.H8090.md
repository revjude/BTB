Shema is mentioned in the list of towns allotted to the tribe of Judah in the Negev region \(Josh. 15:26\). It is listed among other towns in the southern part of Judah's territory, such as Amam, Sheba, and Moladah. The exact location of Shema is unknown, but it was likely situated in the arid region south of Hebron. The name "Shema" means "hear" or "obey" in Hebrew, but the significance of this name in relation to the town is not specified in the biblical text. No other information about Shema is provided in the Bible, and its history and fate remain obscure. The mention of Shema in the list of Judah's towns highlights the extent of the tribe's territory and the numerous settlements that existed in the Negev during the period of the conquest and allotment of the Promised Land.
