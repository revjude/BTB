Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Eutychus</span> was a young man in Troas who fell from a window and was restored to life by Paul.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Phil.4.2|Act.20.9]]; 
- only referred to as Eutychus **<big>[[G2161|Εὔτυχος]]</big>**.

Eutychus was a young man who attended a gathering in Troas where Paul was preaching \(Acts 20:9\). As Paul prolonged his message late into the night, Eutychus, who was sitting in a window, fell asleep and fell from the third story. He was picked up dead, but Paul went down, embraced him, and declared that he was alive \(Acts 20:10\). This miraculous restoration of Eutychus's life demonstrated God's power working through Paul. The incident also highlights the length and depth of Paul's teachings, which could extend late into the night.
