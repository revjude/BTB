<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Mehida</span> was an ancestor of temple servants \(Nethinim\) who returned to Jerusalem from Babylonian captivity \([[Ezra.2.52|Ezr.2.52]]; [[Neh.7.54|Neh.7.54]]\).
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.52|Ezr.2.52]]; 
- only referred to as Mehida **<big>[[H4240|מְחִידָא]]</big>**.

Mehida is mentioned in the lists of the exiles who returned to Jerusalem from Babylonian captivity under the leadership of Zerubbabel. The descendants of Mehida were among the temple servants, also known as Nethinim, who were assigned to assist the Levites in the maintenance and service of the temple \([[Ezra.2.52|Ezra 2:52]]; [[Neh.7.54|Nehemiah 7:54]]\). The Nethinim were a group of people who had been dedicated to the service of the temple, possibly descendants of the Gibeonites who were assigned by Joshua to be woodcutters and water carriers for the house of God \(Joshua 9:27\). The inclusion of Mehida's descendants in the list of returning exiles highlights the importance of the temple servants in the restoration of worship in Jerusalem after the exile.
