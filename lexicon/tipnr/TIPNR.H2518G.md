Hilkiah is mentioned in 2 Kings 18 and Isaiah 22 and 36 as a high-ranking official in the court of King Hezekiah of Judah. He held the position of "master of the household" \([[2Kgs.18.18|2 Kings 18:18]], [[Isa.36.3|Isaiah 36:3]]\), which was a significant role in the royal administration, overseeing the palace and its affairs. 

During the Assyrian invasion led by Sennacherib, Hilkiah, along with Shebna the scribe and Joah the recorder, was sent by Hezekiah to meet with the Assyrian officials \([[2Kgs.18.18|2 Kings 18:18]], [[Isa.36.3|Isaiah 36:3]]\). The Assyrian representative, the Rabshakeh, delivered a threatening message to Hezekiah, urging him to surrender. Hilkiah and his companions reported the message to the king, who then sought the counsel of the prophet Isaiah \([[2Kgs.18.37|2 Kings 18:37]], [[Isa.36.22|Isaiah 36:22]]\). 

In [[Isa.22.20|Isaiah 22:20]]-25, a prophecy is given concerning Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who would replace Shebna as the steward of the royal household. This prophecy emphasizes the importance of the role and the trust placed in the person holding this position. 

Hilkiah's involvement in these key events during Hezekiah's reign highlights his importance as a trusted advisor and official in the king's court.
