Woman living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Lois</span>, the grandmother of Timothy, was commended by Paul for her sincere faith \([[2Tim.1.5|2Ti.1.5]]\).
- A woman living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[2Tim.1.5|2Ti.1.5]]; 
- only referred to as Lois **<big>[[G3090|Λωΐς]]</big>**; 
-  mother of Eunice **<big>[[G2131|Εὐνίκη]]</big>**.

Lois was the grandmother of Timothy, a young Christian leader and companion of the apostle Paul \([[2Tim.1.5|2Ti.1.5]]\). In Paul's second letter to Timothy, he mentioned Lois and her daughter Eunice, Timothy's mother, commending them for their sincere faith. Paul noted that this faith first dwelt in Lois before being passed down to Eunice and then to Timothy. This suggests that Lois played a significant role in the spiritual upbringing and nurturing of her grandson, Timothy. It is likely that Lois, along with Eunice, taught Timothy the Scriptures from a young age, laying a strong foundation for his faith and future ministry \(2Ti.3.14-15\). Although no other details are provided about Lois in the Bible, her legacy of faith and her influence on Timothy's life serve as a testament to the importance of passing on spiritual values from one generation to the next.
