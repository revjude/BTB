Ezer, the ruler of Mizpah, is mentioned in [[Neh.3.19|Nehemiah 3:19]] as one of the individuals who helped repair Jerusalem's wall during the time of Nehemiah. He repaired a section of the wall near the armory, which was located at the angle of the wall. This suggests that Ezer was responsible for a strategically important part of the city's defenses. As the ruler of Mizpah, Ezer likely had significant influence and resources, which he used to contribute to the rebuilding efforts. His participation in the wall's restoration demonstrates the unity and cooperation among the Jewish leaders and people in the face of opposition and challenges.
