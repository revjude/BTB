Zedekiah was a false prophet who, along with another named Ahab, prophesied among the exiles in Babylon during the time of Jeremiah. They falsely predicted an early return from captivity, contradicting Jeremiah's prophecies. Jeremiah sternly rebuked them, not only for their false and reckless predictions but also for their immoral and adulterous lives. He declared that their fate at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar would become proverbial in Israel, with people using their names as a curse, saying, "May the Lord make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire." This Zedekiah is not to be confused with the king of the same name.
