- A man from the tribe of Judah living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[Luke.3.30|Luk.3.30]]; 
- only referred to as Judah **<big>[[G2455|Ἰούδας]]</big>**; 
- a son of Joseph **<big>[[G2501|Ἰωσήφ]]</big>**; 
-  father of Simeon **<big>[[G4826|Συμεών]]</big>**.

Judah is mentioned in [[Luke.3.30|Luke 3:30]] as part of the genealogy of Jesus Christ. This genealogy traces Jesus' lineage through His mother Mary's family line, back to Adam. 

In the genealogy, Judah is listed as the son of Simeon and the father of Joseph. He is one of the ancestors in the period between David and the Babylonian exile. 

The inclusion of Judah in the genealogy demonstrates Jesus' connection to the tribe of Judah and the fulfillment of the messianic prophecies, which indicated that the Messiah would come from the line of David and the tribe of Judah \(Genesis 49:10; Isaiah 11:1-5; Micah 5:2\). 

No additional information is provided about this specific Judah's life or the historical context in which he lived. His mention serves primarily to establish Jesus' lineage and to affirm His messianic identity.
