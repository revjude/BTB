Vophsi is mentioned in the Bible as the father of Nahbi, the man selected from the tribe of Naphtali to be one of the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan. Each tribe provided one man for this mission. Vophsi's son Nahbi was chosen to represent Naphtali. No other details are provided about Vophsi himself. His name is of uncertain meaning, and the text is considered doubtful by some scholars, with variations found in ancient manuscripts.
