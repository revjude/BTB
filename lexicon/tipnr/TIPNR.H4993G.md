Mattithiah was a Levite who was appointed to oversee the baking of the showbread in the temple. The showbread, also known as the bread of the Presence, was a sacred offering that was placed on a table in the Holy Place of the tabernacle or temple. It consisted of twelve loaves, representing the twelve tribes of Israel, and was replaced every Sabbath. Mattithiah's responsibility was to ensure that the bread was properly prepared and presented according to the divine instructions \([[1Chr.9.31|1 Chronicles 9:31]]\).
