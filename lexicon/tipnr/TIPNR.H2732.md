Haradah was a desert campsite mentioned in the book of Numbers as one of the places where the Israelites stopped during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. It is listed in [[Num.33.24|Numbers 33:24]]-25, which records the stages of Israel's journey in the wilderness. 

According to the text, the Israelites set out from Makheloth and camped at Tahath. From there, they moved on and camped at Terah. Then they set out from Terah and camped at Mithkah. The next stop after Mithkah was Hashmonah, followed by Moseroth, Bene-jaakan, Hor-haggidgad, and Jotbathah. After Jotbathah, they camped at Abronah, and then at Ezion-geber. Finally, they set out from Ezion-geber and camped in the wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh. It was after leaving Kadesh that they camped at Mount Hor, and then at Zalmonah, Punon, Oboth, and Iye-abarim. The next stop mentioned after Iye-abarim is Dibon-gad, followed by Almon-diblathaim, and then the mountains of Abarim before Nebo. 

In this context, Haradah is listed between Hashmonah and Makheloth in the sequence of campsites.  

The mention of Haradah in the itinerary of Israel's wilderness journey serves to emphasize God's guidance and provision for His people during their 40-year sojourn in the desert. It also highlights the importance of remembering and recording the various stages of their journey as a testimony to future generations of God's faithfulness and leadership.
