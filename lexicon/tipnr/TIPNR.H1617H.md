Gera, a Benjamite, appears in the narrative of Absalom's rebellion against his father, King David. When David was fleeing from Jerusalem due to Absalom's revolt, Gera's relative, Shimei, came out and cursed David, throwing stones and dirt at him \([[2Sam.16.5|2 Samuel 16:5]]-8\). Shimei accused David of being responsible for the bloodshed in Saul's house and claimed that God was punishing him by giving the kingdom to Absalom. David's servants wanted to kill Shimei for his disrespect, but David refused, believing that God might have sent Shimei to curse him \(2 Samuel 16:9-14\). After Absalom's defeat and death, Shimei, along with Gera and a thousand Benjamites, met David at the Jordan River to escort him back to Jerusalem \([[2Sam.19.16|2 Samuel 19:16]]-18\). Shimei fell down before David and sought forgiveness for his previous actions. David granted him mercy and promised not to put him to death \([[2Sam.19.18|2 Samuel 19:18]]-23\). However, on his deathbed, David instructed his son Solomon to deal with Shimei, considering him guilty of cursing the Lord's anointed \([[1Kgs.2.8|1 Kings 2:8]]-9\). Gera's involvement in these events highlights the complex political dynamics within Israel during David's reign and the lingering tensions between the house of David and the supporters of Saul's dynasty.
