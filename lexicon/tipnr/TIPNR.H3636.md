Chelal is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.30|Ezra 10:30]] as one of the Israelites who had married foreign women during the time of Ezra. After the return from Babylonian exile, Ezra discovered that many of the Israelites, including priests and Levites, had intermarried with the neighboring peoples, contrary to God's commands \(Ezra 9:1-2\). This intermarriage was seen as a violation of the covenant and a threat to the spiritual purity of the nation. Ezra called for a national assembly, where the people confessed their sin and agreed to separate from their foreign wives \(Ezra 10:10-12\). Chelal was among those who had taken foreign wives and pledged to put them away, demonstrating repentance and a commitment to obey God's laws. The inclusion of Chelal's name in this account highlights the importance of maintaining spiritual purity and the need for individuals to take responsibility for their actions in light of God's covenant with His people.
