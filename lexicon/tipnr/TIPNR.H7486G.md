Rameses was a city and region in Egypt where Jacob's family settled when they first arrived in Egypt \(Gen. 47:11\). It was located in the land of Goshen. The Israelites later departed from Rameses at the beginning of the Exodus \(Exo. 12:37; Num. 33:3,5\). The name may come from the Egyptian phrase "Ra created it", referring to the sun god Ra. Some scholars believe Rameses was named after the pharaoh Rameses II of the 19th Dynasty, but the biblical chronology would place the Exodus much earlier. The exact location is uncertain, but it was likely in the eastern Nile Delta region.
