The Sinai Wilderness, also known as the Wilderness of Sinai, was the desert region in the Sinai Peninsula where the Israelites camped after leaving Egypt \([[Exod.19.1|Exodus 19:1]]-2\). It was in this wilderness, at Mount Sinai, that God gave Moses the Ten Commandments and established His covenant with Israel \(Leviticus 7:38, [[Num.3.4|Numbers 3:4]]\). The Israelites set up the Tabernacle in the Sinai Wilderness \([[Num.1.1|Numbers 1:1]],19; 9:1,5\). They took a census of the people there \([[Num.1.1|Numbers 1:1]]9, 26:64\). The Sinai Wilderness was one of the early stops on Israel's journey from Egypt to the Promised Land \([[Num.10.12|Numbers 10:12]], 33:15-16\). The wilderness provided a place of testing and preparation for the nation before they entered Canaan. The Sinai Wilderness is synonymous with the region surrounding Mount Sinai, the place of God's revelation to Moses and Israel.
