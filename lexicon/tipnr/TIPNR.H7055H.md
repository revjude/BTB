Kemuel, the son of Shiphtan, is mentioned in [[Num.34.24|Numbers 34:24]] as one of the leaders appointed by God to help divide the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel. He was chosen as the representative from the tribe of Ephraim. 

The context of the passage is the instructions given by God to Moses regarding the division of the land of Canaan \(Numbers 34:1-29\). God appointed a leader from each tribe to work alongside Eleazar the priest and Joshua in allocating the land as an inheritance to the Israelites. 

Kemuel's appointment as the leader from Ephraim highlights the significance of the tribe of Ephraim and their role in the distribution of the Promised Land. It also demonstrates the importance of having representatives from each tribe involved in the decision-making process. 

Apart from this specific role in the division of the land, no other information is provided about Kemuel's background, family, or any other responsibilities he may have had as a leader of the tribe of Ephraim.
