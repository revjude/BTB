Dura was a plain located in the province of Babylon, mentioned in the book of Daniel. It was the site where King Nebuchadnezzar set up a large golden statue and commanded all the people to worship it \([[Dan.3.1|Daniel 3:1]]\). The exact location of the plain of Dura is unknown, but it was likely situated near the city of Babylon. The name "Dura" is of Akkadian origin and means "walled place" or "fortress." Nebuchadnezzar's decision to erect the statue in Dura may have been influenced by the plain's proximity to Babylon and its suitability for large gatherings. It was in Dura that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to bow down to the statue and were consequently thrown into a fiery furnace, from which they were miraculously delivered by God \(Daniel 3:8-30\).
