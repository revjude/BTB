People from Hushath\(?\)

The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Hushathites</span> were a clan or family that produced several of David's mighty warriors, including Sibbecai and Mebunnai.
- People from Hushath\(?\), first mentioned at [[2Sam.21.18|2Sa.21.18]]; 
- only referred to as Hushathites **<big>[[H2843|חֻשָׁתִי]]</big>**.

The Hushathites are mentioned in several passages in 2 Samuel and 1 Chronicles as a clan or family that produced notable warriors during the reign of King David. 

In [[2Sam.21.18|2 Samuel 21:18]] and [[1Chr.20.4|1 Chronicles 20:4]], Sibbecai the Hushathite is credited with killing Saph \(or Sippai\), one of the descendants of the giants \(Rephaim\) during a battle with the Philistines at Gob. 

Sibbecai the Hushathite is also listed among David's mighty warriors in [[2Sam.23.27|2 Samuel 23:27]] and [[1Chr.11.29|1 Chronicles 11:29]]. These mighty warriors were an elite group of soldiers known for their exceptional bravery and military prowess. 

In [[1Chr.27.11|1 Chronicles 27:11]], Sibbecai the Hushathite is mentioned as the leader of the eighth division of David's army, which served the king for one month out of the year. 

Another Hushathite, Mebunnai, is mentioned in [[2Sam.23.27|2 Samuel 23:27]] as one of David's mighty warriors. However, in the parallel passage in [[1Chr.11.29|1 Chronicles 11:29]], he is called Sibbecai, suggesting that Mebunnai may have been another name for Sibbecai or a scribal variation. 

The Hushathites' repeated mention in the context of David's mighty warriors and military leaders indicates that they were a family or clan known for their skill in battle and their loyalty to the king. Their contributions to David's military success helped to establish and maintain his kingdom.
