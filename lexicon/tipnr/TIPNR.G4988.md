Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Sosthenes</span> was a synagogue ruler in Corinth who was beaten by a mob and later became a co-sender of Paul's first letter to the Corinthians.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.55|Act.18.17]]; 
- only referred to as Sosthenes **<big>[[G4988|Σωσθένης]]</big>**.

Sosthenes is mentioned twice in the New Testament, first in Acts 18:17 and later in [[1Cor.1.1|1 Corinthians 1:1]]. In Acts, Sosthenes is identified as the ruler of the synagogue in Corinth during the time when Paul was preaching there. After the proconsul Gallio dismissed the charges brought against Paul by the Jews, the crowd seized Sosthenes and beat him in front of the tribunal. It is not clear whether Sosthenes was targeted because of his position or because he had shown sympathy toward Paul's message. 

Later, in [[1Cor.1.1|1 Corinthians 1:1]], a Sosthenes is mentioned as a co-sender of Paul's letter to the Corinthian church, along with Paul himself. It is likely, though not certain, that this is the same Sosthenes who was beaten in Corinth. If so, this would indicate that Sosthenes had become a believer and was now working alongside Paul in the ministry. 

The inclusion of Sosthenes as a co-sender of 1 Corinthians suggests that he was a respected figure in the early church and had a significant role in the Corinthian congregation. His presence in the letter's opening greeting would have lent added authority and credibility to Paul's message.
