Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Narcissus</span> was likely a wealthy Christian in Rome with a household of believers.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Rom.16.11|Rom.16.11]]; 
- only referred to as Narcissus **<big>[[G3488|Νάρκισσος]]</big>**.

Narcissus is mentioned in Paul's letter to the Romans as someone in Rome who had a household of believers \([[Rom.16.11|Romans 16:11]]\). Paul sends greetings to those in this household, implying that Narcissus was a prominent Christian, likely wealthy enough to have servants or extended family living with him. Some scholars speculate that he could have been the secretary of the Emperor Claudius, also named Narcissus, who lived during Paul's time. However, the name was common, and Scripture does not provide definitive proof of this connection.
