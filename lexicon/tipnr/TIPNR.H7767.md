- People from Shunam\(?\), first mentioned at [[1Kgs.1.3|1Ki.1.3]]; 
- only referred to as Shunammites **<big>[[H7767|שׁוּנַמִּית]]</big>**.

Shunammites were inhabitants of the town of Shunem, located in the territory of Issachar. The Bible mentions two notable Shunammite women. The first is Abishag, a beautiful young woman who was brought to King David in his old age to serve as his nurse and companion. After David's death, his son Adonijah requested to marry Abishag, which was seen as a bid for the throne and led to his downfall. The second Shunammite woman was a wealthy lady who showed kindness to the prophet Elisha, providing him with a room in her house. When her son died, Elisha miraculously raised him back to life as a reward for her generosity. The Shunammites' appearances in the Bible highlight their hospitality and the significant roles they played in the lives of influential figures like King David and Elisha.
