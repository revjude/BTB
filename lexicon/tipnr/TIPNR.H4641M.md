Maaseiah was an Israelite who was found to have married a foreign woman during the time of Ezra \([[Ezra.10.21|Ezr.10.21]]\). After the return of the Jewish exiles from Babylon, Ezra led a religious reform to address the issue of intermarriage with foreign women, which was seen as a violation of God's commandments \(Ezr.9-10\). Maaseiah is listed among the descendants of Harim who had taken foreign wives \([[Ezra.10.21|Ezr.10.21]]\). As part of the reform, those who had married foreign women were required to separate from their wives and children \(Ezr.10.44\). This event highlights the importance of maintaining religious and ethnic purity within the Jewish community during the post-exilic period.
