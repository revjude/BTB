Bethsaida was a fishing town located on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee. It was the hometown of the disciples Philip, Andrew, and Peter \([[John.1.44|John 1:44]], 12:21\). Jesus visited Bethsaida during His ministry and performed several miracles there, including healing a blind man \([[Mark.8.22|Mark 8:22]]-26\). Bethsaida was one of the cities, along with Chorazin and Capernaum, that Jesus rebuked for their unbelief despite the mighty works He had done in their midst \([[Matt.11.21|Matthew 11:21]], [[Luke.10.13|Luke 10:13]]\). After the miraculous feeding of the five thousand, Jesus instructed His disciples to cross over to Bethsaida while He dismissed the crowd \([[Mark.6.45|Mark 6:45]]\). The exact location of Bethsaida is debated, but it was likely situated near where the Jordan River enters the Sea of Galilee. Bethsaida's name derives from the Hebrew for "house of fishing" or "house of hunting," reflecting its primary industry. The Bible portrays Bethsaida as a place of great spiritual opportunity that largely failed to respond to Jesus' message and miracles.
