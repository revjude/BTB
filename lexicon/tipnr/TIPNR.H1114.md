He is mentioned alongside other prominent figures such as Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and Nehemiah. The return of these leaders marked the beginning of the restoration of Jewish life in Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the temple. Bilshan's presence as a leader indicates his importance and influence within the Jewish community during this significant period of their history.
