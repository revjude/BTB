Idumea was a region located south of Judea, inhabited by the descendants of Esau, also known as the Edomites. In the New Testament, Idumea is mentioned only once, in [[Mark.3.8|Mark 3:8]], which states that people from Idumea came to hear Jesus and to be healed by him. The region was known for its hostility towards the Israelites throughout history, but during the time of Jesus, it was under Roman control. Idumea was gradually absorbed into Judea, and the Edomites were forcibly converted to Judaism by the Hasmonean dynasty in the 2nd century BC.
