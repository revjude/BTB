Micah was a prophet from Moresheth, a town in the Shephelah region of Judah, who prophesied during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah \([[Mic.1.1|Mic.1.1]]\). His prophetic ministry likely spanned from around 750 to 700 BC. Micah's prophecies focused on the judgment of Samaria and Jerusalem for their idolatry, injustice, and oppression of the poor. He also foretold the coming of the Messiah and the restoration of God's people \(Mic.5.2\). Micah's prophecy that Zion would be plowed like a field and Jerusalem would become ruins \(Mic.3.12\) was remembered over a century later during the time of Jeremiah \([[Jer.26.18|Jer.26.18]]\). This reference to Micah's prophecy helped spare Jeremiah's life when he faced the threat of death for prophesying against Jerusalem. The book of Micah, which bears his name, preserves his prophetic messages and is part of the Minor Prophets in the Old Testament.
