Mishma was one of the twelve sons of Ishmael, who was the son of Abraham by his concubine Hagar \([[Gen.25.14|Genesis 25:14]]; [[1Chr.1.30|1 Chronicles 1:30]]\). He is mentioned in the genealogies of Ishmael, which record the names of Ishmael's sons and their descendants, who became the chiefs of the Ishmaelite tribes. 

The listing of Mishma and his brothers in these genealogies highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that Ishmael would be the father of twelve rulers and that his descendants would become a great nation \(Genesis 17:20\). These twelve tribes, each headed by one of Ishmael's sons, likely inhabited the Arabian Peninsula and played a significant role in the region's history and culture. 

Apart from being named as a son of Ishmael and a tribal chief, no further details are provided about Mishma's life, character, or specific role within the Ishmaelite community. Nonetheless, his inclusion in the biblical record affirms his place in the family line of Abraham and the unfolding of God's plan for Ishmael's descendants.
