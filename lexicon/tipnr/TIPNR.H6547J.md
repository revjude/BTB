Pharaoh living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Pharaoh</span>, the Egyptian ruler who refused to release the Israelites from slavery, resulting in the ten plagues and the Exodus.
- An Egyptian Pharaoh living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Exod.3.10|Exo.3.10]]; 
- referred to as Pharaoh **<big>[[H6547|פַּרְעֹה]]</big>**, or Pharaoh **<big>[[G5328|Φαραώ]]</big>**.

This Pharaoh was the Egyptian ruler during the time of the Exodus \(Exodus 3-14\). When Moses and Aaron approached Pharaoh, demanding that he let the Israelites go, Pharaoh refused and increased their labor. God then sent a series of ten plagues upon Egypt, each time giving Pharaoh the opportunity to release the Israelites. However, Pharaoh repeatedly hardened his heart and refused to let them go until the tenth and final plague, the death of the firstborn. 

After the death of his own firstborn son, Pharaoh finally relented and allowed the Israelites to leave Egypt. However, he soon changed his mind and pursued them with his army. God parted the Red Sea for the Israelites to cross on dry land, but when the Egyptian army attempted to follow, the sea closed in on them, drowning Pharaoh and his forces \([[Exod.14.28|Exodus 14:28]]; Psalm 136:15\). 

This Pharaoh is depicted as a stubborn and proud ruler who refused to acknowledge the power and authority of the God of Israel. His story serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and His ability to deliver His people from oppression \([[Rom.9.17|Romans 9:17]]\). The Bible does not provide the specific name or historical identity of this Pharaoh, but some scholars suggest that he may have been Amenhotep II, Thutmose III, or Ramesses II, based on the historical and archaeological evidence.
