Kareah is mentioned in 2 Kings 25 and Jeremiah 40-43 as the father of Johanan and Jonathan, two military leaders who played a significant role in the events following the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in 586 BC. 

After the Babylonians appointed Gedaliah as governor over the remnant of Judah, Johanan and Jonathan, along with other army officers, came to Gedaliah at Mizpah \([[2Kgs.25.23|2 Kings 25:23]]; [[Jer.40.8|Jeremiah 40:8]]\). They pledged their allegiance to Gedaliah and agreed to serve the Babylonians \(Jeremiah 40:9-10\). 

Later, when Johanan learned of a plot by Ishmael to assassinate Gedaliah, he warned the governor, but Gedaliah did not believe him \([[Jer.40.13|Jeremiah 40:13]]-16\). After Ishmael carried out the assassination and fled with captives, Johanan and his men pursued Ishmael and rescued the captives \([[Jer.41.11|Jeremiah 41:11]]-16\). 

Following these events, Johanan, his brother Jonathan, and the other military leaders sought the advice of Jeremiah the prophet, asking whether they should stay in Judah or flee to Egypt \([[Jer.42.1|Jeremiah 42:1]]-3\). Despite Jeremiah's warning to stay in the land, Johanan and the others disobeyed and took the remnant of Judah, including Jeremiah, to Egypt \([[Jer.43.2|Jeremiah 43:2]]-7\). 

Throughout these passages, Kareah is consistently mentioned as the father of Johanan and Jonathan, highlighting their family connection and the significance of their roles in the events surrounding the fall of Jerusalem and its aftermath. The actions of Johanan and Jonathan, as well as their disobedience to Jeremiah's prophetic word, had far-reaching consequences for the remnant of Judah.
