Gerar was an ancient city mentioned in the Bible's earliest geographical descriptions, marking the border of Canaanite territory \([[Gen.10.19|Genesis 10:19]]\). It was located in the region between Kadesh and Shur, in what would become the southern part of Philistine territory. 

 The city features prominently in patriarchal narratives. Abraham sojourned there, where its king Abimelech ruled. During this stay, Abraham presented Sarah as his sister, leading to a diplomatic incident with Abimelech \([[Gen.20.1|Genesis 20:1]]-2\). Later, Isaac also dwelt in Gerar during a famine, repeating his father's pattern by claiming Rebekah was his sister \([[Gen.26.1|Genesis 26:1]],6\). 

 Gerar possessed valuable agricultural land and water resources. Isaac sowed crops there and received a hundredfold return. The area was known for its wells, which became sources of conflict between Isaac's herdsmen and those of Gerar \([[Gen.26.1|Genesis 26:1]]7,20\). Despite these tensions, the king of Gerar ultimately sought a peace treaty with Isaac \([[Gen.26.26|Genesis 26:26]]\). 

 Several centuries later, King Asa of Judah pursued defeated enemies to Gerar in a major military campaign. His forces captured the city and plundered all the surrounding towns, which were noted to contain much spoil \([[2Chr.14.13|2 Chronicles 14:13]]-14\). 

 Probably corresponds to Tell Abu Hureira \(Tel Haror\) in the northern Negev of modern Israel, though some scholars suggest Tel Gerar as an alternative location. 

 Gerar was a significant city spanning from patriarchal times through the period of the divided monarchy, notable for both its agricultural resources and strategic importance.
