The Hamathites were a Canaanite people group mentioned in the Table of Nations \([[Gen.10.18|Genesis 10:18]]; [[1Chr.1.16|1 Chronicles 1:16]]\). They were descendants of Canaan, the son of Ham and grandson of Noah. The Hamathites were named after the city of Hamath, located in modern-day Syria, which was their primary settlement. Hamath was an important city-state in ancient times, known for its strategic location along trade routes. The Hamathites were one of the many Canaanite groups that inhabited the region before the Israelites settled in the land. In later biblical history, Hamath is mentioned as one of the kingdoms that bordered Israel during the reigns of David and Solomon \(2 Samuel 8:9-10; 1 Kings 8:65\). The Hamathites, along with other Canaanite groups, were eventually conquered and assimilated by the Israelites as they took possession of the Promised Land.
