Elihu, identified as King David's brother, is mentioned as the leader of the tribe of Judah \([[1Chr.27.18|1Ch.27.18]]\). He was one of the twelve tribal leaders appointed by David to oversee the administration of the kingdom. Each leader was responsible for the affairs of their tribe for one month of the year. The fact that Elihu is called David's brother suggests that he may have been a close relative or a member of the extended royal family. The Bible does not provide any additional information about Elihu's life or his role as the leader of Judah.
