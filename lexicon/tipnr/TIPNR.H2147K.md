Zichri, also known as Zabdi, was a Levite mentioned in the lists of temple personnel during the time of Nehemiah. He was a descendant of Asaph, one of the principal musicians appointed by David to lead worship in the temple. As a Levite and temple singer, Zichri would have been responsible for providing music and leading the people in praise during the temple services. His inclusion in the lists in both 1 Chronicles and Nehemiah suggests that he played a significant role in the restoration of temple worship after the Babylonian exile. The Levites were essential in maintaining the proper order and conduct of worship in the rebuilt temple.
