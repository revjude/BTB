Hanani is mentioned in [[Neh.12.36|Nehemiah 12:36]] as one of the priests who participated in the dedication ceremony of the rebuilt wall of Jerusalem. After the completion of the wall under Nehemiah's leadership, a great celebration was held to dedicate the wall and give thanks to God. The priests, Levites, and leaders of the people were divided into two groups, each walking in opposite directions on top of the wall. They were accompanied by choirs singing and playing instruments. Hanani was among the priests who were in one of these processions. The two groups met at the temple, where they offered sacrifices and rejoiced with great joy. The mention of Hanani in this context highlights the significance of the priests' role in leading the people in worship and celebrating God's faithfulness in the restoration of Jerusalem.
