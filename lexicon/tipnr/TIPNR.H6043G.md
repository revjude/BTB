Anaiah was a prominent figure during the time of Ezra and Nehemiah. He is mentioned as one of the men who stood beside Ezra on the platform when the scribe read the Book of the Law to the assembled people in Jerusalem. This event took place after the completion of the city wall and marked a significant moment of spiritual renewal for the returned exiles. Anaiah's presence on the platform alongside Ezra suggests that he held a respected position within the community.
