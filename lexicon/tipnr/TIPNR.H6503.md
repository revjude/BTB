Parbar, meaning "colonnade" or "portico," was a structure mentioned in connection with the organization of the Levites and their duties in the temple during the reign of King David \(1 Chr. 26:18\). It was located on the west side of the temple complex in Jerusalem. The Levites were assigned to guard the gates and entrances of the temple, including the gate of Shallecheth, which led to the Parbar. 

The exact nature and purpose of the Parbar are not described in detail in the Bible. It may have been a colonnade or a series of chambers used for storage or other functions related to the temple service. Some scholars suggest that the Parbar might have been a part of the temple complex added during the reign of Solomon or later kings. However, due to the limited information provided in the biblical text, the precise structure and role of the Parbar remain uncertain.
