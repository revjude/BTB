Zechariah is listed as the fourth son of Hosah, a Merarite. The Korahites were a clan within the tribe of Levi, descendants of Korah. The Merarites were one of the three main divisions of the Levites, along with the Kohathites and Gershonites. They were responsible for the tabernacle's structural components and transportation during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness. Zaccur's mention in this genealogy highlights the importance of the Levitical lineage and their roles in Israelite worship.
