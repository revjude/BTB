Zechariah was a priest who served in the temple during the reign of Herod the Great. He belonged to the priestly division of Abijah, and his wife, Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron. Zechariah and Elizabeth are described as righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord. 

Despite their righteousness, Zechariah and Elizabeth were childless, and both were advanced in years. While performing his priestly duties in the temple, Zechariah was chosen by lot to enter the sanctuary and burn incense. During this time, an angel of the Lord appeared to him and announced that his prayer had been heard, and that Elizabeth would bear a son named John. Zechariah doubted the message due to their old age, and as a result, he was struck mute until the birth of his son. 

When Elizabeth gave birth, Zechariah confirmed that the child's name should be John, as the angel had instructed. Upon doing so, his speech was restored, and he was filled with the Holy Spirit, prophesying about the role his son would play in preparing the way for the Messiah. 

Zechariah's prophecy, known as the Benedictus, speaks of God's mercy and the coming of the Messiah, who would bring salvation and deliverance to His people. He also foretold that his son, John, would be called the prophet of the Most High and would go before the Lord to prepare His ways.
