People from Shuh\(?\)

The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Shuhites</span> were a people group to which Bildad, one of Job's friends, belonged.
- People from Shuh\(?\), first mentioned at [[Job.2.11|Job.2.11]]; 
- only referred to as Shuhites **<big>[[H7747|שׁוּחִי]]</big>**.

The Shuhites are mentioned in the Book of Job \([[Job.2.11|Job 2:11]]; 8:1; 18:1; 25:1; 42:9\) in connection with Bildad, one of Job's three friends who came to comfort him during his affliction. Bildad is consistently referred to as "Bildad the Shuhite," indicating that he belonged to the Shuhite people group. The Shuhites' exact location and origin are not specified in the Bible. Bildad, along with Eliphaz the Temanite and Zophar the Naamathite, engaged in a series of dialogues with Job, attempting to explain his suffering and urging him to repent. However, their understanding of God's ways was limited, and they often accused Job wrongly. In the end, God rebuked Bildad and his friends for not speaking rightly about Him, and they were required to offer a sacrifice and have Job pray for them to be forgiven.
