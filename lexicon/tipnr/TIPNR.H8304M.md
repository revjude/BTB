- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[Jer.36.26|Jer.36.26]]; 
- only referred to as Seraiah **<big>[[H8304|שְׂרָיָה]]</big>**; 
- a son of Azriel **<big>[[H5837|עַזְרִיאֵל]]</big>**.

Seraiah, mentioned in [[Jer.36.26|Jeremiah 36:26]], was the son of Azriel and a member of King Jehoiakim's court. When Jeremiah's prophecies were read before the king, Jehoiakim became angry and ordered the arrest of Jeremiah and his scribe, Baruch. The king sent Seraiah, along with Jerahmeel, a member of the royal family, and Shelemiah, the son of Abdeel, to seize Jeremiah and Baruch. However, the Lord hid them, and they were not found. This incident highlights the opposition and persecution faced by Jeremiah for proclaiming God's messages, as well as God's protection over His faithful servants.
