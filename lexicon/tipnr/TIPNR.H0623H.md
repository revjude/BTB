Asaph was a prominent Levite musician and psalmist during the reign of King David. He was appointed by David as one of the leaders of music in the tabernacle and later in the temple. Asaph, along with Heman and Ethan, was responsible for leading the musical worship and prophesying with lyres, harps, and cymbals. He also composed and collected psalms, with 12 psalms \(50, 73-83\) attributed to him in the Book of Psalms. Asaph's descendants continued to serve as temple singers and musicians for generations, as evidenced by their mention in the reigns of subsequent kings and in the post-exilic period. The "sons of Asaph" are often referred to as a distinct group of temple singers, highlighting the enduring legacy of Asaph's musical contributions to Israelite worship.
