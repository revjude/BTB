Woman living at the time of United Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Abishag</span>, the beautiful Shunammite who served King David in his old age and was later sought as a wife by Adonijah \([[1Kgs.1.3|1Ki.1.3]],15; 2.17,21,22\).
- A woman living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Kgs.1.3|1Ki.1.3]]; 
- only referred to as Abishag **<big>[[H0049|אֲבִישַׁג]]</big>**.

Abishag was a beautiful young woman from Shunem who was chosen to serve King David in his old age \([[1Kgs.1.3|1 Kings 1:3]]\). She was brought to the king to keep him warm and to attend to his needs, but David did not have sexual relations with her \(1 Kings 1:4\). 

After David's death, his son Adonijah, who had previously attempted to claim the throne, approached Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. He requested that she ask King Solomon to give him Abishag as his wife \([[1Kgs.2.17|1 Kings 2:17]]\). However, Solomon perceived this request as a challenge to his kingship, as taking the king's concubine was a symbolic claim to the throne \(2 Samuel 16:21-22\). 

Solomon responded with anger, interpreting Adonijah's request as tantamount to asking for the kingdom itself. He vowed that Adonijah's request would cost him his life \([[1Kgs.2.22|1 Kings 2:22]]-23\). Subsequently, Solomon ordered Benaiah to execute Adonijah \(1 Kings 2:25\). The incident with Abishag reveals the political intrigues and power struggles that occurred during the transition of power from David to Solomon. It also underscores the significance of the king's concubines in the context of royal succession in ancient Israel.
