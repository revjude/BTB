Maaziah, also referred to as Maadiah or Moadiah, was a priest who lived during the time of Nehemiah, after the return of the Jewish exiles from Babylon \([[Neh.10.8|Neh.10.8]]; 12.5,17\). He is mentioned among the priests who sealed the covenant, a solemn agreement made by the people of Israel to follow God's law and to maintain the temple worship \(Neh.10.1-29\). Maaziah's inclusion in this list indicates his prominence and leadership role within the priestly community. He is also listed among the priests who returned from exile with Zerubbabel \(Neh.12.1-7\) and among the heads of the priestly families during the high priesthood of Joiakim \(Neh.12.12-21\). These multiple mentions of Maaziah in the context of priestly service and leadership underscore the significance of the priesthood in the restoration of Jewish worship and community life after the exile.
