Nahbi, the son of Vophsi, is mentioned in [[Num.13.14|Numbers 13:14]] as the representative from the tribe of Naphtali among the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan. This event took place during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt. 

As the Israelites approached the Promised Land, Moses selected twelve men, one from each tribe, to conduct a reconnaissance mission in Canaan. Their task was to assess the land, its inhabitants, and its resources, and to report back to the people. 

Nahbi was chosen as the spy representing the tribe of Naphtali. Along with the other eleven spies, he embarked on a forty-day mission, traversing the land from the Negev desert to the northern region of Rehob. 

Upon their return, the spies reported that the land was indeed bountiful, flowing with milk and honey. However, ten of the spies, including Nahbi, also emphasized the challenges they would face, describing the inhabitants as powerful and the cities as fortified. Only Joshua and Caleb, the spies from the tribes of Ephraim and Judah, respectively, expressed faith in God's ability to help them conquer the land. 

The negative report from the majority of the spies, including Nahbi, led to fear and rebellion among the Israelites. As a result, God declared that the generation who had witnessed the miracles in Egypt would not enter the Promised Land, with the exception of Joshua and Caleb. 

Nahbi's role in this narrative serves as a reminder of the importance of faith and trust in God, even in the face of challenging circumstances. It also highlights the consequences of allowing fear and doubt to overcome one's belief in God's promises.
