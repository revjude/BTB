Jahdo is mentioned in [[1Chr.5.14|1 Chronicles 5:14]] as a son of Buz, who was a descendant of Gad. He is listed among the clan heads of the Gadites during the reign of King Jotham of Judah and King Jeroboam II of Israel. This suggests that Jahdo held a leadership position within the tribe of Gad during this period. The biblical text does not provide any further details about Jahdo's life or specific role as a clan head.
