- A man living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, only mentioned at [[Exod.6.25|Exo.6.25]]; 
- only referred to as Putiel **<big>[[H6317|פּוּטִיאֵל]]</big>**.

Putiel is mentioned in the Bible as the father-in-law of Eleazar, who was a son of Aaron, the first High Priest of Israel \([[Exod.6.25|Exodus 6:25]]\). Eleazar married one of Putiel's daughters, but her name is not specified in the text. This marriage took place during the time of the Israelites' bondage in Egypt, before the Exodus. Putiel's ancestry or tribe is not provided in the biblical record, and no further details about him are given. His mention in the genealogy of Aaron's family suggests that he was likely an Israelite living in Egypt during this period.
