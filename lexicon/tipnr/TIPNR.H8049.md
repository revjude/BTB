Shamhuth, mentioned in [[1Chr.27.8|1 Chronicles 27:8]], was one of the twelve division commanders in King David's army. He is identified as an Izrahite, indicating his family or tribal affiliation. Shamhuth was in charge of the fifth division, which served during the fifth month of each year. The army was divided into twelve divisions, each serving for one month, to ensure a well-organized and efficient military structure. As a division commander, Shamhuth would have been responsible for leading his troops, maintaining their readiness, and engaging in military campaigns when necessary.
