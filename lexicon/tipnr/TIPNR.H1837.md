Dannah was a city situated in the hill country of Judah, mentioned only once in the Bible \([[Josh.15.49|Joshua 15:49]]\). It was listed among the cities allotted to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land under Joshua. The exact location of Dannah is unknown, but it was likely located in the central hill country of Judea, south of Jerusalem. As part of the inheritance of Judah, Dannah would have been one of the many cities and villages that the tribe was responsible for settling and defending.
