Mount Perazim is mentioned in [[Isa.28.21|Isaiah 28:21]] as a place where the Lord will rise up and do His "strange work" and "alien task," referring to His judgment against the wicked. The name "Perazim" is derived from the Hebrew word "perez," meaning "to break through" or "to burst forth." The reference to Mount Perazim in Isaiah's prophecy alludes to David's victory over the Philistines at Baal-perazim \(2 Sam. 5:20; 1 Chr. 14:11\). In that battle, David acknowledged that the Lord had broken through his enemies like a bursting flood, hence the name "Baal-perazim," meaning "Lord of the bursting forth." 

By using Mount Perazim as an example, Isaiah emphasizes that just as God granted David victory over the Philistines, He will also bring judgment upon those who oppose Him. The prophet warns that God's judgment will be swift and decisive, like His intervention on behalf of David. The mention of Mount Perazim in Isaiah's prophecy serves as a reminder of God's power and His willingness to act on behalf of His people while also bringing judgment upon the wicked.
