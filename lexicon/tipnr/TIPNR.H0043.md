Ebiasaph, also known as Abiasaph or Asaph, is mentioned in several genealogies in the Old Testament. He was a descendant of Korah, the Levite who led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness \(Numbers 16\). 

In the genealogies of the Levites in [[1Chr.6.23|1 Chronicles 6:23]],37, Ebiasaph is listed as the son of Korah and the ancestor of the temple singers and musicians. This genealogy traces the lineage of the Levites from the time of Moses to the reign of King David. 

Ebiasaph is also mentioned in [[Exod.6.24|Exodus 6:24]] as one of the sons of Korah, along with Assir and Elkanah. This passage is part of the genealogy of the Levites, specifically the descendants of Kohath, who were responsible for carrying the sacred objects of the tabernacle during the Israelites' wilderness wanderings. 

In [[1Chr.9.19|1 Chronicles 9:19]], Ebiasaph is identified as an ancestor of the gatekeepers of the tabernacle. The gatekeepers were responsible for guarding the entrances to the sacred areas and ensuring that only authorized personnel could enter. 

Furthermore, in [[1Chr.26.1|1 Chronicles 26:1]], Ebiasaph is mentioned as the ancestor of a division of gatekeepers during the time of King David. This passage describes the organization of the Levites and their duties in the temple service. 

The interchangeable use of the names Ebiasaph, Abiasaph, and Asaph in these passages suggests that they refer to the same individual. The variations in spelling may be due to differences in transliteration or scribal traditions. 

Ebiasaph's inclusion in these genealogies highlights the importance of the Levitical lineage and their roles in the tabernacle and temple service. As a descendant of Korah, Ebiasaph's family line was redeemed from the rebellion and given the privilege of serving in the house of the Lord.
