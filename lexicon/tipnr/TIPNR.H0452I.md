- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.21|Ezr.10.21]]; 
- only referred to as Elijah **<big>[[H0452|אֵלִיָּה]]</big>**.

Elijah is mentioned in the Book of Ezra as one of the descendants of Harim who had married foreign women during the Babylonian exile \([[Ezra.10.21|Ezr.10.21]]\). After the return to Jerusalem, Ezra discovered that many Israelites, including priests and Levites, had intermarried with the neighboring peoples, which was against God's command. Elijah was among those who had taken foreign wives, but he agreed to put away his wife as part of the covenant renewal led by Ezra. The Bible does not provide any further details about this Elijah's life or family.
