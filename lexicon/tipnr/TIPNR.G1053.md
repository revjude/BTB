Galatia was a region located in central Asia Minor, in present-day Turkey. It was named after the Galatians, a Celtic people who settled in the area in the 3rd century BC. In the New Testament, Galatia is mentioned several times in connection with the Apostle Paul's missionary work and his epistle to the Galatians. Paul visited the region of Galatia on his first and second missionary journeys \(Acts 16:6; 18:23\), establishing churches and preaching the gospel. He later wrote a letter to the churches in Galatia, addressing issues of faith, justification, and Christian liberty \([[Gal.1.2|Galatians 1:2]]\). In his epistle, Paul expressed concern about the Galatians being led astray by false teachings and emphasized the importance of salvation through faith in Christ alone \([[Gal.3.1|Galatians 3:1]]; 6:18\). Galatia is also mentioned in other New Testament passages, such as [[1Cor.16.1|1 Corinthians 16:1]], where Paul instructs the Galatian churches to participate in a collection for the believers in Jerusalem, and [[2Tim.4.10|2 Timothy 4:10]], where it is noted that Crescens had gone to Galatia. Additionally, [[1Pet.1.1|1 Peter 1:1]] includes Galatia among the regions where the apostle Peter addressed his letter to the scattered believers.
