Rohgah is briefly mentioned in [[1Chr.7.34|1 Chronicles 7:34]] as one of the sons of Shomer \(or 'Shamer'\), who was a descendant of Asher. The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 7 lists some of the prominent families and individuals within the tribe of Asher, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. Rohgah is listed alongside his brothers Ahi, Jehubbah, and Aram as sons of Shomer \(or 'Shamer'\). No further information is provided about Rohgah or his role within the tribe. His inclusion in the genealogy serves to document the family lines and descendants of Asher, the eighth son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and Zilpah, whose tribe was allotted territory in the northern part of Canaan along the Mediterranean coast.
