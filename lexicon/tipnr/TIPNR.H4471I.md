Father of Mamre The father of Mamre, an Amorite, is mentioned briefly in [[Gen.14.13|Genesis 14:13]]. His name is not provided in the biblical text. Mamre, along with his brothers Eshcol and Aner, was an ally of Abraham during the time when Abraham lived near the terebinth trees of Mamre in Hebron. When Abraham learned that his nephew Lot had been captured by Chedorlaomer and his allies, he gathered his 318 trained servants and pursued them. Mamre and his brothers joined Abraham in this pursuit, demonstrating their loyalty and support for Abraham and his family \(Genesis 14:24\).
