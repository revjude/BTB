Sarid is mentioned twice in the Bible, both times in the context of describing the borders of the territory allotted to the tribe of Zebulun \(Josh. 19:10, 12\). The town served as a boundary marker for Zebulun's territory, which was located in the northern part of Canaan, southwest of the Sea of Galilee. The exact location of Sarid is unknown, but it was likely situated near the border between Zebulun and the neighboring tribe of Issachar.
