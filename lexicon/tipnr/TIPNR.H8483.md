Kadesh is mentioned in [[2Sam.24.6|2 Samuel 24:6]] as a place visited by Joab, the commander of David's army, during the census of Israel ordered by King David. The census, which was considered a sinful act, brought God's anger upon Israel. Joab and the army leaders traveled through the land, including the area of Kadesh, to count the people. The exact location of this Kadesh is uncertain, and it is not clear if it is the same as Kadesh-barnea, a more prominent place mentioned elsewhere in the Bible.
