Apollonia was a city in the region of Macedonia, located along the Via Egnatia, the main Roman road connecting the Adriatic Sea with the Hellespont. It is mentioned in Acts 17:1 as one of the cities through which Paul and his companions passed on their way from Philippi to Thessalonica during Paul's second missionary journey. 

The text does not provide any details about Paul's activities or the duration of his stay in Apollonia. It simply states that they passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia before arriving in Thessalonica. This suggests that Apollonia was a transit point along the route, and Paul's primary focus was on reaching Thessalonica, where he spent significant time preaching and establishing a church. 

Apollonia was situated about 30 miles \(48 km\) southwest of Amphipolis and about 37 miles \(60 km\) northeast of Thessalonica. The city was named after the Greek god Apollo and was known for its strategic location and commercial importance. 

The mention of Apollonia in the context of Paul's journey highlights the apostle's systematic approach to evangelizing major cities and his use of the well-established Roman road system to facilitate his travel and the spread of the gospel.
