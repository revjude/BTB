Kolaiah son of Maaseiah was a false prophet among the Jewish exiles in Babylon during the time of Jeremiah. The Lord declared that he and Ahab son of Kolaiah would be delivered into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who would put them to death as people watched. Their names would be used in a curse by the exiles, saying, "May the Lord treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon burned in the fire" \([[Jer.29.21|Jer.29.21]]-22\). Kolaiah's false prophecies and immoral behavior led to his disgraceful demise.
