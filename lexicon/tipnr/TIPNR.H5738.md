<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Eder</span> was a descendant of Benjamin, mentioned as one of the sons of Beriah in the genealogy of the Benjamites. \([[1Chr.8.15|1Ch.8.15]]\)
- A man from the tribe of Benjamin  living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, only mentioned at [[1Chr.8.15|1Ch.8.15]]; 
- only referred to as Eder<[[H5738]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ֶ֫<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ֶ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>\); 
-  son of Beriah<[[H1283I]]>; 
- a brother of Arad<[[H6166B]]>, Ahio<[[H0283H]]>, Shashak<[[H8349]]>, Jeremoth<[[H3406I]]>, Zebadiah<[[H2069G]]>, Michael<[[H4317L]]>, Ishpah<[[H3472]]> and Joha<[[H3109G]]>.

Eder is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.8.15|1 Chronicles 8:15]] as one of the sons of Beriah, a descendant of Benjamin. He is listed along with his brothers Zebadiah and Arad. 

The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 8 traces the lineage of the tribe of Benjamin, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. Benjamin was the youngest son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and Rachel, and his descendants settled in the region allotted to them in the Promised Land. 

Eder and his brothers are mentioned in the context of the descendants of Elpaal, who is identified as one of the sons of Shaharaim \(1 Chronicles 8:12\). The genealogy then proceeds to list the sons of Beriah, including Eder. 

The mention of Eder in this genealogy serves to highlight the importance of family lineage and tribal identity in ancient Israelite society. It also demonstrates the detailed record-keeping of the Chronicler, who sought to preserve the genealogical history of the tribes of Israel. 

Apart from this brief mention, no further information is provided about Eder or his specific role within the tribe of Benjamin. His inclusion in the genealogy helps to establish the continuity of the Benjamite lineage and their connection to the larger history of Israel.
