Kenaz is mentioned in several passages as the father of Othniel, a prominent figure in the early history of Israel. Othniel was a brave warrior and a judge who delivered the Israelites from the oppression of Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia \([[Judg.3.9|Judges 3:9]]-11\). 

Kenaz is first mentioned in the context of Caleb's conquest of Hebron. Caleb offered his daughter Achsah in marriage to whoever would attack and capture the city of Debir. Othniel, the son of Kenaz and Caleb's younger brother, successfully accomplished this task and married Achsah \([[Josh.15.17|Joshua 15:17]]; [[Judg.1.13|Judges 1:13]]\). 

Othniel's father Kenaz is also mentioned in the genealogy of the tribe of Judah \([[1Chr.4.13|1 Chronicles 4:13]]\). This genealogical record confirms Kenaz's relationship to Caleb and his place within the tribe of Judah. 

Furthermore, Kenaz is mentioned in the context of Caleb's faithfulness to God. Caleb and Joshua were the only two spies who brought back a positive report about the Promised Land and encouraged the Israelites to trust in God \([[Num.32.12|Numbers 32:12]]; [[Josh.14.6|Joshua 14:6]], 14\). Caleb is referred to as "the Kenizzite," indicating his connection to the Kenizzite clan, likely through his father Jephunneh. 

The story of Kenaz and his son Othniel highlights the importance of faith, courage, and obedience to God in the early history of Israel. Othniel's role as a judge and deliverer of Israel also demonstrates God's faithfulness in raising up leaders to guide and protect His people.
