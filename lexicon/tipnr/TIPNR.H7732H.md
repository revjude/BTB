Shobal is mentioned in [[1Chr.2.50|1 Chronicles 2:50]],52 and 4:1,2 as a descendant of Judah through Hur, the son of Caleb, though the text is difficult to interpret. He is described as the father \(ie founder\) of Kiriath-jearim, a city in Judah. The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 2 lists Shobal among the descendants of Hur, along with his brothers Salma and Hareph. In 1 Chronicles 4, Shobal is mentioned again as the father of Reaiah, who was the father of Jahath. This passage also states that the families of Kiriath-jearim, including the Ithrites, Puthites, Shumathites, and Mishraites, were descended from Shobal. These clans were known for their various occupations, such as scribes, linen workers, and potters. Shobal's mention in the genealogies of Judah highlights his role as an ancestor of prominent families and clans within the tribe.
