- only referred to as Hiel **<big>[[H2419|חִיאֵל]]</big>**;

Hiel the Bethelite is mentioned in [[1Kgs.16.34|1 Kings 16:34]] as the man who rebuilt the city of Jericho during the reign of King Ahab of Israel. Jericho had been destroyed and cursed by Joshua centuries earlier \(Joshua 6:26\), with a warning that whoever rebuilt the city would do so at the cost of his firstborn and youngest sons. 

Despite this curse, Hiel rebuilt Jericho, and as a result, he lost his firstborn son, Abiram, when he laid the foundation, and his youngest son, Segub, when he set up the gates. This event is recorded as a fulfillment of Joshua's prophecy and a demonstration of the power of God's word. 

Hiel's actions were in direct disobedience to God's command and showed a disregard for the history and spiritual significance of Jericho. His story serves as a warning against disobedience and the consequences of ignoring God's word.
