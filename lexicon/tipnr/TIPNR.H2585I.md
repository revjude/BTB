Hanoch is mentioned in [[Gen.25.4|Genesis 25:4]] and [[1Chr.1.33|1 Chronicles 1:33]] as one of the sons of Midian, who was a son of Abraham through his wife Keturah. After Sarah's death, Abraham took Keturah as his wife, and she bore him several children, including Midian \(Genesis 25:1-2\). Hanoch is listed among the five sons of Midian, along with Ephah, Epher, Abida, and Eldaah. These sons and their descendants became the tribes of the Midianites, who are mentioned throughout the Old Testament. The Midianites lived in the region east of the Jordan River and were known for their trading and nomadic lifestyle. The mention of Hanoch in the genealogy of Abraham's descendants through Keturah highlights the diverse nations that emerged from Abraham's lineage, fulfilling God's promise to make him a father of many nations \(Genesis 17:4-6\).
