Arumah, also known as Rumah, is a city mentioned twice in the Bible in different contexts. In [[Judg.9.41|Judges 9:41]], Arumah is associated with Abimelech, the son of Gideon, who ruled as a king over Israel for three years. After Abimelech's conflict with the people of Shechem, he lived in Arumah, possibly using it as a base of operations or a place of refuge. 

The city is mentioned again in [[2Kgs.23.36|2 Kings 23:36]], where it is identified as the hometown of Zebidah, the mother of King Jehoiakim of Judah. Jehoiakim, who reigned in the early 6th century BC, was a vassal of Egypt and later Babylon. The mention of Rumah as his mother's place of origin suggests that the city may have been located in the northern kingdom of Israel or in the region of Samaria. 

The exact location of Arumah or Rumah is uncertain, but some scholars propose that it could be identified with Khirbet el-Ormah, a site about 6 miles \(10 km\) southeast of Shechem. However, this identification remains tentative. 

The biblical references to Arumah or Rumah, though brief, provide glimpses into the political and familial connections of significant figures in Israel's history, such as Abimelech and King Jehoiakim. The city's association with these individuals suggests its relative importance during their respective times.
