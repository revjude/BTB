Aziza is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.27|Ezra 10:27]] as one of the descendants of Zattu who had married foreign women during the time of Ezra. After the return of the exiles from Babylon, Ezra discovered that many of the Israelites, including priests and Levites, had intermarried with the surrounding nations, contrary to God's law. Ezra called the people to repentance and urged them to separate themselves from their foreign wives. Aziza was among those who had taken foreign wives and agreed to put them away, demonstrating his willingness to obey God's commands and to maintain the purity of the Israelite community.
