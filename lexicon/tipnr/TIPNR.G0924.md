Bartimaeus was a blind beggar mentioned in [[Mark.10.46|Mark 10:46]]-52. He was the son of Timaeus and sat by the roadside near Jericho. When he heard that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by, he began to cry out, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!" Despite the crowd's attempts to silence him, Bartimaeus persisted in calling out to Jesus. Jesus stopped and asked for Bartimaeus to be brought to Him. When asked what he wanted, Bartimaeus replied, "Rabbi, I want to see." Jesus told him, "Go your way; your faith has made you well." Immediately, Bartimaeus received his sight and followed Jesus on the way. This miracle demonstrates Jesus' compassion and power to heal, as well as the importance of faith and persistence in seeking His help. Bartimaeus' story is an example of how Jesus responded to the needs of the marginalized and restored them physically and spiritually.
