Zabud was the son of Nathan, who was likely the prophet and advisor to King David. Zabud held a significant position in the court of King Solomon, serving both as a priest and as the king's friend. His dual role as a religious leader and a trusted companion to the king highlights the close relationship between the monarchy and the priesthood in ancient Israel.
