Zeboiim was one of the five cities of the plain, along with Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zoar, located in the area now covered by the Dead Sea. It is first mentioned in [[Gen.10.19|Genesis 10:19]] as part of the description of the territory of Canaan, extending from Sidon to Gaza and then eastward toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim. In Genesis 14, Zeboiim is listed among the cities that rebelled against Chedorlaomer, the king of Elam, and his allies after serving them for twelve years. The king of Zeboiim, along with the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Bela \(Zoar\), engaged in battle against Chedorlaomer and his allies in the Valley of Siddim but were defeated \(Gen. 14:2, 8-10\). Later, when God determined to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah for their wickedness, Zeboiim was also included in the destruction \(Deut. 29:23\). The prophet Hosea, in a message of judgment against Israel, refers to Zeboiim along with Admah as examples of God's punishment, emphasizing the severity of Israel's impending judgment \(Hos. 11:8\). The destruction of Zeboiim, along with the other cities of the plain, serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of persistent wickedness and disobedience to God.
