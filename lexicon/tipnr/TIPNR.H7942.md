Shikkeron is mentioned briefly in the description of the northern border of Judah's territory \(Josh. 15:11\). It is listed along with Mount Baalah and Jabneel as landmarks defining the boundary. The exact location of Shikkeron is unknown, but it was likely situated in the Shephelah region, the lowlands between the central hill country and the coastal plain of Israel. No other information about Shikkeron is provided in the biblical text, and its history and significance remain obscure. The mention of Shikkeron in the boundary description highlights the extent of Judah's territory and the various towns and landmarks that marked its borders. The inclusion of such details in the book of Joshua emphasizes the importance of the allotment of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel and the fulfillment of God's promise to give them the land as an inheritance.
