Tarshish was a distant maritime city or region mentioned in various contexts throughout the Old Testament. It was known for its ships, which were used in long-distance trade \(1 Kgs. 10:22; 2 Chr. 9:21\). The "ships of Tarshish" became a symbol of wealth and commercial power \(Isa. 2:16; 23:1, 14; 60:9; Ezek. 27:25\). Tarshish was a source of silver, iron, tin, and lead \(Jer. 10:9; Ezek. 27:12\). It was also associated with other distant and exotic locations, such as Sheba and Seba \(Ps. 72:10\). The exact location of Tarshish is uncertain, but many scholars believe it was situated in southern Spain, possibly near the ancient Phoenician colony of Tartessus. In the book of Jonah, the prophet attempts to flee from God's presence by sailing to Tarshish, emphasizing its distance from Israel \(Jonah 1:3\). The wealth and splendor of Tarshish are used as a metaphor for God's judgment \(Isa. 23:6, 10; Ezek. 38:13\). Despite its prominence, Tarshish would ultimately be subject to God's sovereignty \(Ps. 48:7\).
