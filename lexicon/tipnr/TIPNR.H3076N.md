Jehohanan is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.28|Ezra 10:28]] as one of the descendants of Bebai who had married foreign women during the Babylonian exile. This chapter lists the names of the men who had taken foreign wives, including representatives from various families and clans. Jehohanan's inclusion in this list suggests that he, like many others, had married a woman from one of the surrounding nations, which was contrary to the Law of Moses. In response to Ezra's call for repentance and reform, these men pledged to put away their foreign wives and children, demonstrating their willingness to follow Ezra's leadership and to restore their obedience to God's law. The text does not provide any further details about Jehohanan's life or his role in the community.
