Mount Seir is a specific mountain or mountainous region within the larger area of Seir, which was inhabited by the Edomites. It is mentioned several times in the Bible, often in the context of the Israelites' interactions with the Edomites during their wilderness wanderings and later in their history. 

Mount Seir is first mentioned in the book of Deuteronomy, where it is described as an eleven-day journey from Horeb \(Sinai\) by way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea \(Deut. 1:2\). The Israelites were instructed to turn away from Mount Seir and pass through the territory of their brothers, the descendants of Esau, without provoking them \(Deut. 2:1, 5\). 

During the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, the Moabites, Ammonites, and some of the Meunites came against Judah by way of Mount Seir \(2 Chr. 20:10, 22, 23\). However, God caused these enemies to turn against each other, resulting in their defeat and the deliverance of Judah. 

The prophet Ezekiel also delivered oracles against Mount Seir, declaring God's judgment against the Edomites for their hostility towards Israel \(Ezek. 35:2, 3, 7, 15\). This judgment would result in the desolation of Mount Seir and the recognition of God's sovereignty. 

The specific location of Mount Seir within the region of Seir is not clearly defined in the Bible. However, its association with the Edomites and its strategic importance in military campaigns suggest that it was a prominent and well-fortified area within the mountainous region of Seir.
