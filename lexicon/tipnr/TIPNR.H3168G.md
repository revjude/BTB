This chapter describes the organization of the priests into 24 divisions, each responsible for serving in the temple for a specific period. Jehezkel was chosen by lot to lead the 20th division. The priests were descendants of Aaron and were responsible for offering sacrifices, maintaining the temple, and performing other religious duties.
