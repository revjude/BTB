Ruth was a Moabite woman who married Mahlon, the son of Elimelech and Naomi, who had moved to Moab from Bethlehem due to a famine \(Ruth 1:1-4\). After the deaths of Elimelech, Mahlon, and Chilion \(Naomi's other son\), Naomi decided to return to Bethlehem \(Ruth 1:6-7\). Ruth, despite Naomi's urging to return to her own people, insisted on staying with her mother-in-law, demonstrating remarkable loyalty and faith in the God of Israel \(Ruth 1:14-18\). In Bethlehem, Ruth worked in the fields, gleaning grain to support herself and Naomi \(Ruth 2:2-3\). She caught the attention of Boaz, a wealthy relative of Elimelech \(Ruth 2:8-16\). Following Naomi's advice, Ruth approached Boaz at the threshing floor, asking him to fulfill the role of a kinsman-redeemer \(Ruth 3:1-9\). Boaz, impressed by Ruth's character and loyalty, agreed to marry her after a closer relative declined to do so \(Ruth 4:1-12\). Ruth and Boaz had a son named Obed, who became the grandfather of King David \(Ruth 4:13-17\). As an ancestor of David, Ruth is also mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus Christ \([[Matt.1.5|Matthew 1:5]]\). Her story exemplifies God's grace, providential care, and the inclusion of Gentiles in His plan of redemption.
