Bilgah was a priest who served as the head of the fifteenth division of priests during the reign of King David \(1 Ch. 24:14\). David, along with Zadok and Ahimelech, divided the descendants of Aaron into twenty-four divisions for the purpose of organizing their service in the temple. Each division was responsible for ministering in the temple for a specific period of time throughout the year. The division of the priests ensured a systematic and orderly approach to the temple service, with each group fulfilling their duties in turn. Bilgah's position as the head of the fifteenth division highlights the importance of the priestly role in maintaining the spiritual life of the nation and the centrality of the temple in Israelite worship.
