Abdon, also called Ebron, was a town allotted to the Levites within the tribal territory of Asher \([[Josh.21.30|Joshua 21:30]], [[1Chr.6.74|1 Chronicles 6:74]]\). It was one of four cities given to the Gershonite Levites from the tribe of Asher \(Joshua 21:27-31, 1 Chronicles 6:71-74\). The parallel texts in Joshua and 1 Chronicles have different spellings of the name, Abdon versus Ebron, but clearly refer to the same town. [[Josh.19.28|Joshua 19:28]] mentions Ebron in a list of towns within Asher's inheritance, confirming its location. No other details are given about Abdon in the Bible. Its exact location is uncertain, but it was presumably near the other Levitical cities of Asher: Mashal, Hukkok and Rehob.
