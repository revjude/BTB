Eleazar, the son of Aaron, is prominently featured in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, and 1 Chronicles. He was the third son of Aaron and Elisheba \([[Exod.6.23|Exodus 6:23]],25\) and was consecrated as a priest along with his brothers \([[Exod.28.1|Exodus 28:1]]\). After the deaths of his older brothers, Nadab and Abihu \(Leviticus 10:1-2\), Eleazar became the chief priest under his father \([[Num.3.32|Numbers 3:32]]\). He assisted Moses in the census \([[Num.26.1|Numbers 26:1]],3,63\) and the allocation of lands to the tribes \([[Num.32.2|Numbers 32:2]],28; 34:17; [[Josh.14.1|Joshua 14:1]]; 17:4; 19:51\). Eleazar succeeded Aaron as high priest \([[Num.20.25|Numbers 20:25]]-28; Deuteronomy 10:6\) and served in that role during the conquest of Canaan \([[Josh.21.1|Joshua 21:1]]; 22:13,31,32\). He played a key role in the distribution of the Levitical cities \([[Josh.21.1|Joshua 21:1]]\) and died during the time of Joshua \([[Josh.24.33|Joshua 24:33]]\). His descendants continued to serve as priests \([[Judg.20.28|Judges 20:28]]; [[1Chr.6.3|1 Chronicles 6:3]]-4,50; 9:20; 24:1-6; [[Ezra.7.5|Ezra 7:5]]\).
