The People's Gate, mentioned in [[Jer.17.19|Jeremiah 17:19]], was one of the gates of Jerusalem during the time of the prophet Jeremiah. The Lord instructed Jeremiah to stand in the People's Gate and proclaim a message to the kings of Judah and all the people who entered through that gate. The message emphasized the importance of keeping the Sabbath day holy and refraining from work on that day. The exact location of the People's Gate is not specified in the biblical text, but it was likely one of the main entrances to the city, where people from various walks of life would pass through. The gate's name suggests that it was a popular and well-frequented access point to Jerusalem. Jeremiah's proclamation at the People's Gate underscores the prophetic call to obedience and the centrality of the Sabbath in the religious life of Judah.
