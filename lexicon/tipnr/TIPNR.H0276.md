- A man living at the time of the Patriarchs, only mentioned at [[Gen.26.26|Gen.26.26]]; 
- only referred to as Ahuzzath **<big>[[H0276|אֲחֻזַּת]]</big>**.

Ahuzzath is mentioned in the context of the relationship between Isaac and Abimelech, the Philistine king of Gerar. After Isaac had settled in Gerar and prospered, Abimelech recognized that God was with Isaac and sought to make a peace treaty with him. 

Abimelech came to Isaac, accompanied by his friend Ahuzzath and Phicol, the commander of his army. \([[Gen.26.26|Gen.26.26]]\) The presence of Ahuzzath, described as Abimelech's friend, suggests that he was a close advisor or confidant of the king. 

Together, they proposed a covenant of peace with Isaac, acknowledging that they had seen God's favor upon him. They requested that Isaac do no harm to them, just as they had not harmed him and had sent him away in peace. \(Gen.26.27-29\) 

Isaac agreed to the covenant, and they ate and drank together, sealing the agreement. The next morning, they swore an oath to each other, and Isaac sent them on their way in peace. \(Gen.26.30-31\) 

Ahuzzath's role in this narrative highlights the importance of diplomacy and the value of trusted advisors in ancient Near Eastern royal courts. His presence alongside Abimelech demonstrates the king's desire to establish peaceful relations with Isaac and the Israelites.
