The Sabeans, also known as Sheba, are mentioned in several passages in the Old Testament \([[Gen.10.7|Genesis 10:7]]; [[1Chr.1.9|1 Chronicles 1:9]]; [[Job.1.15|Job 1:15]]; Joel 3:8; [[Isa.45.14|Isaiah 45:14]]; [[Ezek.23.42|Ezekiel 23:42]]\). They were descendants of Cush, the son of Ham, and were known for their wealth and extensive trade. The Sabeans were associated with the region of Sheba, located in the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula, in modern-day Yemen. They were renowned for their trade in spices, gold, precious stones, and other luxury goods. In the book of Job, the Sabeans are mentioned as raiders who attacked and plundered Job's livestock, highlighting their military prowess. The queen of Sheba, who visited King Solomon, was likely a ruler of this kingdom, emphasizing the Sabeans' prominence and wealth. The prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel also mention the Sabeans in the context of trade and their association with luxury items. The Sabeans played a significant role in the ancient Near Eastern trade network and were known for their prosperity and influence in the region.
