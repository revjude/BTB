- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.29|Ezr.10.29]];

Jashub is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.29|Ezra 10:29]] as one of the Israelites who had married foreign women during the time of Ezra. After the return from the Babylonian exile, Ezra discovered that many Israelites had intermarried with the pagan peoples of the land, which was a violation of God's command to maintain their holiness and avoid idolatry. Ezra called for a solemn assembly, during which the people confessed their sin and agreed to separate from their foreign wives. Jashub is listed among those who had taken foreign wives and pledged to put them away. The text does not provide any further details about Jashub's life or the specific circumstances of his marriage. His inclusion in this list serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining purity and obedience to God's commands.
