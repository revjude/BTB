Edrei was one of the chief cities of Bashan, located east of the Jordan River. It was ruled by Og, king of Bashan, who was defeated by the Israelites under Moses' leadership as they approached the Promised Land \([[Num.21.33|Numbers 21:33]]-35\). 

After its capture, the city was allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh. Edrei is mentioned alongside Ashtaroth as one of the main cities in Bashan. The ruins of Edrei are identified with modern-day Der'a in Syria.
