Salmone is mentioned in the book of Acts as a promontory or coastal feature on the island of Crete. During Paul's voyage to Rome as a prisoner, the ship he was on sailed along the southern coast of Crete, opposite Salmone \(Acts 27:7\). This reference provides a geographical marker for the route taken by the ship before it encountered difficult sailing conditions and eventually shipwrecked on the island of Malta \(Acts 27:8-44\). Salmone is believed to be the modern-day Cape Sidero, the northeastern extremity of Crete, which extends into the Mediterranean Sea. The mention of Salmone in Acts helps to trace the path of Paul's journey and highlights the challenges faced by early Christian missionaries as they traveled throughout the Roman Empire.
