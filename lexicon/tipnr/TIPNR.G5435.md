Phrygia was an ancient region located in the central part of Asia Minor \(modern-day Turkey\). In the New Testament, Phrygia is mentioned in connection with the spread of the gospel and the missionary journeys of Paul. On the day of Pentecost, people from Phrygia were among those present in Jerusalem who heard the apostles speaking in their own languages \(Acts 2:10\). During Paul's second missionary journey, he and his companions traveled through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, where they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach in the province of Asia \(Acts 16:6\). On his third missionary journey, Paul passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia again, strengthening the disciples \(Acts 18:23\). In the closing of Paul's first letter to Timothy, he mentions that some have wandered from the faith, including Phygelus and Hermogenes, who were likely from Phrygia \(2 Tim. 1:15\). The mention of Phrygia in these passages highlights the spread of Christianity beyond Judea and the importance of the region in the early church's growth.
