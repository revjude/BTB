The Dragon Spring was a water source located near Jerusalem, mentioned in the context of Nehemiah's inspection of the city walls \([[Neh.2.13|Nehemiah 2:13]]\). During Nehemiah's nighttime survey of the damaged walls of Jerusalem, he passed by the Dragon Spring on his way to the Valley Gate and the King's Pool. The exact location of the Dragon Spring is uncertain, but it was likely situated on the eastern side of the city, possibly near the Kidron Valley. The name "Dragon Spring" may refer to the shape of the water source or to a decorative dragon-like structure associated with it. The mention of the Dragon Spring highlights the importance of water sources for ancient Jerusalem and the need to secure them as part of the city's defenses.
