<small>*In  Benjamin\(?\) • Town whose people returned from Babylonian exile*</small>

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Senaah</span> was a town whose people are listed among those who returned to Judah from the Babylonian exile \(Ezr. 2:35; Neh. 7:38\).
- A location in Benjamin Tribe\(?\) first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.35|Ezr.2.35]]; 
- only referred to as Senaah **<big>[[H5570|סְנָאָה]]</big>**.

Senaah is mentioned in the lists of people who returned to Judah from the Babylonian exile, as recorded in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah \(Ezr. 2:35; Neh. 7:38\). The name "Senaah" is likely a variant of "Hassenaah," which means "the thorny" or "the pointed" in Hebrew. In both lists, the people of Senaah are counted among those who returned to their homeland under the leadership of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah. The town of Senaah is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, and its exact location is unknown. It was probably a small settlement in Judah, possibly near Jerusalem, where the returning exiles resettled after the Babylonian captivity. The inclusion of Senaah in these lists highlights the importance of recording the names and numbers of those who returned from exile, as they played a crucial role in rebuilding the Jewish community and restoring worship in Jerusalem.
