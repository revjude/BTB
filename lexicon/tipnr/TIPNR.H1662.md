Gath-hepher is mentioned in the Bible as a town located in the territory of Zebulun, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. It is primarily known as the hometown of the prophet Jonah, who was called by God to preach to the people of Nineveh \([[2Kgs.14.25|2 Kings 14:25]]\). 

The town is first mentioned in [[Josh.19.13|Joshua 19:13]], where it is listed among the cities and villages allotted to the tribe of Zebulun during the division of the Promised Land. Its exact location is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the region of Lower Galilee, near the border with Asher. 

Apart from being the birthplace of Jonah, no other significant events or individuals are associated with Gath-hepher in the Bible. The mention of Jonah's origins in [[2Kgs.14.25|2 Kings 14:25]] serves to provide background information about the prophet and to emphasize his Israelite heritage. 

The name Gath-hepher is composed of two elements: "Gath," meaning "winepress," and "hepher," which may be derived from a root meaning "to dig" or "to explore." This suggests that the town may have been known for its wine production or its location near a significant well or water source.
