Eliashib is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.6|Ezra 10:6]] as a priest associated with the chamber of Jehohanan, the son of Eliashib. This reference occurs in the context of Ezra's reforms, particularly addressing the issue of intermarriage between the Israelites and foreign women. Ezra went to the chamber of Jehohanan to fast and mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles who had married foreign women. The chamber of Jehohanan likely refers to a room within the temple complex.
