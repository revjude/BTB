Uriah is mentioned briefly in [[Neh.8.4|Nehemiah 8:4]] as one of the priests who stood beside Ezra when he read the Book of the Law to the assembled people in Jerusalem. This event took place during a time of religious revival and renewal, as the Israelites sought to reestablish their covenant relationship with God after returning from Babylonian exile. Uriah, along with other priests and Levites, supported Ezra in his role as a teacher and spiritual leader, helping to make the Law clear and understandable to the people. The presence of Uriah and the other priests alongside Ezra demonstrates the importance of religious leadership and the collaborative effort involved in guiding the people in their renewed commitment to God's commands.
