-  father of Zipporah **<big>[[H6855|צִפֹּרָה]]</big>** and Hobab **<big>[[H2246|חֹבָב]]</big>**.

Jethro, also referred to as Reuel, was Moses' father-in-law and a priest of Midian. He is first mentioned in [[Exod.2.18|Exodus 2:18]], where his daughters tell him about Moses defending them at a well. Later, in [[Exod.3.1|Exodus 3:1]], Moses is described as tending Jethro's flock when he encounters the burning bush. 

After the Exodus, Jethro visits Moses in the wilderness, bringing along Moses' wife Zipporah and their two sons \([[Exod.18.1|Exo.18.1]]-6\). Jethro praises God for the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt \([[Exod.18.9|Exo.18.9]]-10\) and offers sacrifices to God \([[Exod.18.1|Exo.18.1]]2\). 

Observing Moses' heavy workload in judging the people, Jethro advises him to appoint capable men to share the burden \([[Exod.18.1|Exo.18.1]]3-23\). Moses follows this advice and bids farewell to Jethro, who returns to his own land \([[Exod.18.2|Exo.18.2]]4-27\). In [[Num.10.29|Numbers 10:29]], Moses invites Hobab, identified as Reuel's son, to join the Israelites on their journey, suggesting a continued relationship between Moses and Jethro's family.
