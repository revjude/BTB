- only referred to as Simeon<[[G4826G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Συμεών</span>\).

Simeon, mentioned in [[Luke.2.25|Luke 2:25]]-35, was a righteous and devout man living in Jerusalem at the time of Jesus' birth. He was eagerly waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit had revealed to him that he would not die before seeing the Lord's Christ. When Mary and Joseph brought the infant Jesus to the temple for the purification rites according to the Law of Moses, Simeon, guided by the Spirit, took Jesus in his arms and praised God. He declared that he could now depart in peace, having seen God's salvation, which was prepared for all people - a light for revelation to the Gentiles and glory to Israel. Simeon then blessed Mary and Joseph and prophesied to Mary that her child would cause the fall and rise of many in Israel and be a sign that would be spoken against, revealing the thoughts of many hearts. He also foretold that a sword would pierce Mary's own soul, foreshadowing the pain she would experience witnessing her son's suffering and death.
