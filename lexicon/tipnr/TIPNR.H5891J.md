Ephah is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Isa.60.6|Isaiah 60:6]], as part of a prophecy describing the future glory of Jerusalem. In this passage, Isaiah speaks of various nations and tribes coming to Jerusalem, bringing their wealth and resources as offerings to the Lord. 

Among these tribes is Ephah, which is described as bringing a multitude of camels and dromedaries \(young camels\) from Midian and Sheba. This suggests that Ephah was an Arabian tribe known for their camel herds and their involvement in the caravan trade. 

The name Ephah is associated with the Midianites, as one of Abraham's sons by his concubine Keturah was named Ephah \(Genesis 25:4\). However, it is unclear whether the Ephah mentioned in Isaiah's prophecy is directly related to this individual or simply shares the same name. 

Isaiah's prophecy portrays a future time when the wealth of the nations, including that of the Arabian tribes like Ephah, will be brought to Jerusalem in recognition of the Lord's glory and the significance of His people. The inclusion of Ephah in this prophecy highlights the far-reaching influence and attraction of the restored Jerusalem.
