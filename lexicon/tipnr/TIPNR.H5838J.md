Azariah is mentioned in [[1Chr.2.38|1 Chronicles 2:38]]-39 as a descendant of Jerahmeel, who was the son of Hezron, a prominent figure in the tribe of Judah. Azariah is listed in the genealogy of Jerahmeel's family, which is a subset of the larger genealogy of Judah. He is identified as the son of Obed and the father of Helez. The genealogies in Chronicles often serve to highlight the continuity of family lines and the preservation of the identity of the people of Israel. Azariah's inclusion in this genealogy suggests that he was a significant member of Jerahmeel's family line, although no additional information about his life or role is provided in the text.
