Dedan is mentioned in the genealogies of Genesis 10 and 1 Chronicles 1 as a descendant of Cush, the son of Ham. He is listed as the son of Raamah and the brother of Sheba \([[Gen.10.7|Genesis 10:7]]; [[1Chr.1.9|1 Chronicles 1:9]]\). 

The genealogies in these chapters provide an overview of the nations and peoples that descended from Noah's sons after the flood. Dedan's placement within the lineage of Cush suggests that his descendants may have settled in the regions associated with the Cushites, such as parts of Arabia and eastern Africa. 

Apart from these genealogical references, no further information is provided about Dedan or his specific role in the biblical narrative. His mention serves to trace the origins and spread of the nations in the ancient Near East.
