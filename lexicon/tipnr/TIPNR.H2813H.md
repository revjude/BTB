Hashabneiah was a Levite who participated in a public ceremony of prayer and confession during the time of Nehemiah. He, along with several other Levites, led the people in blessing the Lord and recounting His faithfulness to Israel throughout history. This ceremony took place after the completion of Jerusalem's wall and the reading of the Law to the people. Hashabneiah's role in this ceremony highlights the importance of the Levites in leading the people in worship and prayer. \([[Neh.9.5|Neh.9.5]]\).
