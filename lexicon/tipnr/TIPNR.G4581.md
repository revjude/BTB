Seleucia, also known as Seleucia Pieria, was a port city located near the mouth of the Orontes River on the Mediterranean coast of Syria. It served as the seaport for the city of Antioch, which was located about 16 miles inland. Seleucia was founded by Seleucus I Nicator, one of Alexander the Great's generals, around 300 BC and became an important center of trade and commerce in the Seleucid Empire. In the New Testament, Seleucia is mentioned in Acts 13:4 as the place from which Paul and Barnabas set sail for Cyprus on their first missionary journey after being sent out by the church in Antioch. The city's strategic location made it an ideal starting point for sea travel to the Mediterranean islands and beyond. Today, the ruins of ancient Seleucia can be found near the modern Turkish city of Samandağ.
