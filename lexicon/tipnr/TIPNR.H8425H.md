Beth-togarmah is mentioned twice in the Book of Ezekiel, both times in the context of prophetic visions concerning the future of Israel and the nations surrounding it. 

In [[Ezek.27.14|Ezekiel 27:14]], Beth-togarmah is listed among the trading partners of the city of Tyre, a major commercial center on the Mediterranean coast. The people of Beth-togarmah are described as supplying horses, war horses, and mules to the markets of Tyre. This suggests that Beth-togarmah was known for its livestock, particularly horses, and that it had a significant role in the ancient Near Eastern trade network. 

The exact location of Beth-togarmah is uncertain, but it is generally associated with the region of Armenia or Anatolia \(modern-day Turkey\). Some scholars propose that the name "Beth-togarmah" may be related to the Anatolian city of Tegarama, known from Hittite texts, or to the Armenian city of Tilgarimmu, mentioned in Assyrian records. 

In [[Ezek.38.6|Ezekiel 38:6]], Beth-togarmah is mentioned again, this time in the context of a prophetic vision about a future invasion of Israel by a coalition of nations led by Gog, from the land of Magog. Beth-togarmah is described as being "from the far north," along with Gomer and its troops, suggesting a geographical location north of Israel. This prophecy portrays Beth-togarmah as one of the allies of Gog in the latter days, participating in the attack on Israel. 

The prophecy in Ezekiel 38-39 is often interpreted as a symbolic representation of the final battle between the forces of good and evil, with Gog and its allies representing the nations that oppose God and His people. The ultimate defeat of Gog and its allies, including Beth-togarmah, emphasizes God's sovereignty and the eventual triumph of His kingdom.
