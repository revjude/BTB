Taberah was a place where the Israelites camped during their wilderness journey. It is mentioned in [[Num.11.3|Numbers 11:3]] and Deuteronomy 9:22. The name "Taberah" means "burning" and was given to the site because of the incident that occurred there. The people complained against God, and in response, the Lord sent fire that consumed some of the outskirts of the camp. Moses interceded for the people, and the fire died down. The event at Taberah is cited as an example of the Israelites' rebellion and God's judgment during their wilderness wanderings.
