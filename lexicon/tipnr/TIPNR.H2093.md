Zaham is mentioned as one of the sons of King Rehoboam, who ruled over Judah after the division of the kingdom following Solomon's death. Zaham's mother was Mahalath, the daughter of Jerimoth, son of David, and of Abihail, daughter of Eliab, son of Jesse. The listing of Zaham among Rehoboam's sons provides insight into the royal family of Judah during the early years of the divided monarchy.
