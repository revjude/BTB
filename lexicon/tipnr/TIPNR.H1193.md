Baal-tamar is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Judg.20.33|Judges 20:33]], in the context of a battle between the Israelites and the Benjamites. The Israelites set up an ambush against the Benjamites, with some troops taking up positions at Baal-tamar. The exact location of Baal-tamar is not specified, but it was near Gibeah, a city in the territory of Benjamin. The name "Baal-tamar" means "Lord of the Palm Tree," suggesting that the place was known for a notable palm tree.
