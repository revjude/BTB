Man living at the time of United Monarchy

The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Matri</span>te \(or Matri\) clan was Saul's ancestral clan from the tribe of Benjamin \([[1Sam.10.21|1Sa.10.21]]\).
- A man living at the time of United Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Sam.10.21|1Sa.10.21]]; 
- only referred to as Matri or a Matrite **<big>[[H4309|מַטְרִי]]</big>**.

The Matrite, also known as Matri, was a clan within the tribe of Benjamin. When Saul was chosen to be the first king of Israel, the selection process involved casting lots among the tribes, clans, and families. The lot fell on the tribe of Benjamin, then on the Matrite clan, and finally on Saul, the son of Kish \([[1Sam.10.21|1 Samuel 10:21]]\). This indicates that Saul's family belonged to the Matrite clan within the tribe of Benjamin.
