- A man from the tribe of Ephraim living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.7.20b|1Ch.7.20b]]; 
- only referred to as Tahath **<big>[[H8480|תַּחַת]]</big>**; 
- a son of Eleadah **<big>[[H0497|אֶלְעָדָה]]</big>**;

Tahath was a second descendant of Ephraim mentioned in the genealogy found in 1 Chronicles. He was the son of Eleadah and the father of Zabad. The repetition of the name Tahath within the same genealogy suggests that it may have been a common name within the tribe of Ephraim or that naming children after ancestors was a common practice. The inclusion of both Tahaths in the genealogy highlights the importance of preserving and recording family lineages in ancient Israelite culture.
