Maaseiah was a priest who played a role in the coronation of King Joash of Judah \([[2Chr.23.1|2Ch.23.1]]\). During the reign of Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, who had usurped the throne and killed the royal heirs, Jehoiada the priest organized a coup to restore the Davidic line \(2Ch.22.10-23.21\). Maaseiah, along with other leaders and Levites, was part of the group that Jehoiada gathered to support the young prince Joash and overthrow Athaliah. The coup was successful, and Joash was crowned king at the age of seven \(2Ch.24.1\). Maaseiah's involvement in this event highlights the importance of the priesthood in maintaining the religious and political stability of the kingdom of Judah.
