Zetham was a Levite of the Gershonite clan, mentioned in the genealogies and organizational lists of the Levites during the reign of King David. He was a son of Laadan and is listed along with his brothers Jehiel and Joel. In David's organization of the Levites, Zetham and his brothers were appointed as treasurers and officials over the treasuries of the house of the Lord. This suggests that they held positions of responsibility in managing the resources and wealth associated with the tabernacle and later the temple.
