Joiarib \(also known as Jehoiarib\) was the name of a priestly family that returned from the Babylonian exile. In [[Neh.11.10|Nehemiah 11:10]] and [[1Chr.9.10|1 Chronicles 9:10]], Jedaiah, a descendant of Joiarib, is mentioned among the priests who settled in Jerusalem after the exile. This suggests that the family of Joiarib was among those who returned to Judah and took up residence in the holy city. 

Joiarib is also listed in [[Neh.12.6|Nehemiah 12:6]] as one of the priestly families that returned with Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, and Jeshua, the high priest. This return marked the beginning of the restoration of Jewish worship and religious life in Jerusalem after the exile. 

In [[Neh.12.19|Nehemiah 12:19]], Joiarib is mentioned again in the context of the organization of the priestly divisions during the time of Joiakim, the son of Jeshua. This indicates that the family of Joiarib continued to serve as priests in the restored temple and played a role in the religious leadership of the post-exilic Jewish community. 

The repeated mentions of Joiarib in these genealogical and historical records emphasize the significance of this priestly family in the religious life of the Jews after the Babylonian exile. They were among those who helped to restore and maintain the temple worship and preserve the religious traditions of Israel.
