Athaliah is mentioned in Ezra 8 as one of the descendants of Elam who returned to Jerusalem from Babylonian captivity. He was part of the group that accompanied Ezra, the priest and scribe, on his journey to Jerusalem to teach and enforce the Law of Moses. Ezra had gathered a number of leading men from various families to join him in this mission. Athaliah's presence in this list suggests that he was a prominent figure among the returnees and played a role in the religious and social reforms initiated by Ezra.
