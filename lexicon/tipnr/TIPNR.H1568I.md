Gilead is mentioned in [[Judg.11.1|Judges 11:1]]-2 as the father of Jephthah, a judge of Israel. Jephthah is described as a mighty warrior and the son of Gilead by a prostitute. Gilead's legitimate sons, born to his wife, drove Jephthah away, denying him a share in the inheritance because of his mother's status. As a result, Jephthah fled from his brothers and settled in the land of Tob, where he gathered a group of worthless men around him. Later, when the Ammonites made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead approached Jephthah and asked him to be their commander in the fight against the Ammonites \(Judges 11:4-6\). Jephthah agreed on the condition that he would become the head over Gilead if he successfully defeated the Ammonites \(Judges 11:7-11\). Gilead's role in this narrative is limited to being the father of Jephthah and the namesake of the region where Jephthah and his brothers lived. The story of Jephthah and his relationship with Gilead and his half-brothers provides insight into the social dynamics and family conflicts of the time, as well as the role of judges in delivering Israel from its enemies.
