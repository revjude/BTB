Miniamin is mentioned in the book of 2 Chronicles as a Levite who served during the reign of King Hezekiah \([[2Chr.31.15|2Ch.31.15]]\). As part of Hezekiah's religious reforms, the king organized the priests and Levites into their respective divisions and ensured that they received their due portions from the offerings and tithes brought by the people \(2Ch.31.2-4\). Miniamin, along with Eden, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, was appointed to distribute these portions faithfully to their fellow Levites in their cities, both to the older and younger generations \([[2Chr.31.15|2Ch.31.15]]\). This distribution was carried out according to the genealogical records and the responsibilities of the Levites in their service at the temple \(2Ch.31.16-18\). Miniamin's role in this process highlights the importance of proper organization and fairness in the administration of the temple and the support of the Levites.
