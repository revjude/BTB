Joelah is mentioned in [[1Chr.12.7|1 Chronicles 12:7]] as one of the Benjaminite warriors who joined David at Ziklag while he was fleeing from King Saul. Along with his brother Zebadiah, Joelah is described as a brave warrior and a leader among the Benjaminites. They were part of a group of skilled archers and slingers who came to support David during this difficult period in his life. The chronicler emphasizes the military prowess and loyalty of these men, noting that they were "brave warriors, ready for battle and able to handle the shield and spear" \(1Ch.12.8\). Joelah's decision to align himself with David demonstrates his faith in David's divine appointment as the future king of Israel, even while Saul was still on the throne.
