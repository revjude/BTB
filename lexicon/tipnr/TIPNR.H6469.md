Peullethai was the eighth son of Obed-Edom, a Levite who served as a gatekeeper in the temple during the reign of King David, according to [[1Chr.26.5|1 Chronicles 26:5]]. Obed-Edom and his sons were appointed to guard the southern gate of the temple and the storehouse. The Bible mentions that God blessed Obed-Edom and his household, giving him eight sons, including Peullethai. This blessing was likely due to Obed-Edom's faithful service in caring for the Ark of the Covenant \(2 Samuel 6:10-12\).
