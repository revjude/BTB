Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Simon</span> was a tanner in Joppa who hosted the apostle Peter in his home.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Luke.3.30|Act.8.13]]; 
- only referred to as Simon<[[G4613N]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Σίμων</span>\).

Simon, a tanner by trade, is mentioned in the book of Acts as a resident of Joppa who hosted the apostle Peter \(Acts 9:43; 10:6,17,32\). As a tanner, Simon worked with animal hides to produce leather, a profession that was considered unclean by Jewish religious standards. Despite this, Peter stayed with Simon for many days, indicating a growing openness in the early church to interact with Gentiles and those considered unclean. During his stay at Simon's house, Peter received a vision from God in which he was told not to call anything impure that God has made clean \(Acts 10:9-16\). This vision prepared Peter for his encounter with Cornelius, a Gentile centurion, whom God had directed to send for Peter \(Acts 10:17-33\). Peter's time at Simon the tanner's house marks a significant shift in the early church's understanding of the gospel's inclusivity and the breaking down of barriers between Jews and Gentiles.
