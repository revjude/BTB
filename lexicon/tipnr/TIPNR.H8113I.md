Shimri is mentioned in [[1Chr.26.10|1 Chronicles 26:10]] as a Levite who served as a gatekeeper during the reign of King David. He is described as the son of Hosah, who was also a gatekeeper. The passage lists the divisions of the gatekeepers and their responsibilities in guarding the entrances to the temple and its courtyards. Although Shimri is not explicitly mentioned as the firstborn, the text notes that his father appointed him as the chief, suggesting that he held a leadership role among the gatekeepers. As a gatekeeper, Shimri would have been responsible for maintaining the security and order of the temple premises.
