Jeduthun, also referred to as Ethan, was a prominent Levitical musician and singer during the reign of King David. He is mentioned numerous times in 1 Chronicles and 2 Chronicles, as well as in the titles of several psalms. Jeduthun was one of the three principal musicians appointed by David to lead the music and singing in the tabernacle, alongside Asaph and Heman \([[1Chr.16.41|1 Chronicles 16:41]]-42; 25:1, 6\). He and his sons were skilled in playing the harp, lyre, and cymbals \(1 Chronicles 16:42; 25:3\). Jeduthun's descendants continued to serve as musicians in the temple during the reigns of subsequent kings, such as Solomon \([[2Chr.5.12|2 Chronicles 5:12]]\) and Hezekiah \([[2Chr.29.14|2 Chronicles 29:14]]; 35:15\). Three psalms \(Psalms 39, 62, and 77\) are attributed to Jeduthun, indicating his role in composing or leading the music for these hymns. In [[1Chr.6.44|1 Chronicles 6:44]] and 15:17, 19, he is referred to as Ethan, suggesting that this was either an alternate name or a title. Jeduthun's significant role in the musical worship of ancient Israel highlights the importance of music and singing in the religious life of the nation.
