Man living at the time of the Patriarchs

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Nahor</span>, the son of Serug and father of Terah, was Abraham's grandfather.
- A man living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.11.22|Gen.11.22]]; 
- referred to as Nahor<[[H5152G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>חו</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>\), or Nahor \(KJV= Nachor\) <[[G3493]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ναχώρ</span>\); 
- a son of Serug<[[H8286]]>; 
-  father of Terah<[[H8646G]]>.

Nahor, mentioned in [[Gen.11.22|Genesis 11:22]]-25, [[Josh.24.2|Joshua 24:2]], [[1Chr.1.26|1 Chronicles 1:26]], and [[Luke.3.34|Luke 3:34]], was the son of Serug and the father of Terah. He was the grandfather of Abraham, the patriarch of the Israelites. 

According to the genealogical records in Genesis and 1 Chronicles, Nahor was born to Serug when Serug was 30 years old. Nahor himself became the father of Terah at the age of 29 and lived for a total of 148 years. 

In [[Josh.24.2|Joshua 24:2]], it is mentioned that Terah and his family, including Nahor, lived beyond the Euphrates River and served other gods. This suggests that Nahor and his family were originally polytheistic and not worshippers of the one true God. 

Nahor's significance in the biblical narrative lies primarily in his role as a direct ancestor of Abraham. His inclusion in the genealogies of Genesis, 1 Chronicles, and Luke demonstrates the importance of tracing the lineage of the patriarchs and establishing the continuity of God's plan through the generations.
