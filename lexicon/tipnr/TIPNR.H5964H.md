Alemeth is mentioned briefly in the genealogy of the tribe of Benjamin, specifically as a son of Becher. \([[1Chr.7.8|1Ch.7.8]]\) 

Becher was one of the sons of Benjamin, the youngest son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\). \(Gen.46.21\) The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 7 lists the descendants of Becher, including Alemeth and his brothers, Zemira, Joash, Eliezer, Elioenai, Omri, Jeremoth, and Abijah. \([[1Chr.7.8|1Ch.7.8]]\) 

The listing of Alemeth and his brothers indicates that they were part of the Benjamite clan descended from Becher. However, no further information is provided about Alemeth's life, his role within the family, or any significant events associated with him. 

The genealogies in Chronicles serve to document the lineage of the Israelite tribes and to highlight the importance of family heritage in the post-exilic Jewish community. The mention of Alemeth in this context helps to establish the continuity of the Benjamite lineage and its various branches.
