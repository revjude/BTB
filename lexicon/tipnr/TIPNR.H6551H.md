Parosh is mentioned as one of the leaders who returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, after the Babylonian exile \([[Ezra.8.3|Ezra 8:3]]\). He is described as bringing a group of his descendants with him, indicating that he was the head of a family or clan. The return of Parosh and his family, along with other leaders and their families, was part of the second wave of Jewish exiles who returned to Jerusalem under the leadership of Ezra the scribe. This group of returnees played a significant role in the restoration of Jerusalem and the temple, as well as the spiritual and social renewal of the Jewish community. The mention of Parosh as a leader among the returnees highlights the importance of family and clan leadership in the organization and governance of the Jewish community during this period of restoration.
