- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[2Chr.34.12|2Ch.34.12]];

Obadiah was a Levite who served as an overseer during the repairs of the temple in the reign of King Josiah of Judah \([[2Chr.34.12|2 Chronicles 34:12]]\). He was one of the Levites appointed to supervise the workmen and ensure that the repairs were carried out according to the king's instructions. The temple had fallen into disrepair during the reigns of previous kings who had turned away from the Lord. Josiah's initiative to restore the temple was a significant step in his reforms to bring Judah back to the worship of the true God. Obadiah's role as an overseer demonstrates the involvement of the Levites in the practical aspects of maintaining the temple and supporting the king's religious reforms.
