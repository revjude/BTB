Geruth Chimham is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Jer.41.17|Jeremiah 41:17]], in the context of the events following the Babylonian conquest of Judah and the murder of Gedaliah, the appointed governor. 

After Gedaliah was assassinated by Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, a group of leaders led by Johanan, son of Kareah, pursued Ishmael and rescued the captives he had taken. Fearing retaliation from the Babylonians for Gedaliah's murder, Johanan and his group, along with the rescued captives, sought refuge in Geruth Chimham, which was near Bethlehem. 

The name "Geruth Chimham" suggests that it was a lodging place or caravanserai associated with someone named Chimham. Some scholars believe that this Chimham may have been the son of Barzillai the Gileadite, who is mentioned in 2 Samuel 19:37-40 as having provided for King David during his flight from Absalom. David, in return, offered to care for Chimham and allow him to return to Jerusalem with him. 

If this connection is accurate, it is possible that David granted Chimham a piece of land near Bethlehem, where he established a lodging place for travelers. This would explain why Johanan and his group sought refuge there, as it was a known and established location. 

The mention of Geruth Chimham in [[Jer.41.17|Jeremiah 41:17]] highlights the chaos and fear that followed the Babylonian conquest and the murder of Gedaliah, as well as the desperate measures taken by those seeking to escape potential retribution. It also provides a glimpse into the practice of establishing lodging places for travelers in ancient times.
