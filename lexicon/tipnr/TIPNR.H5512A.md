Pelusium, referred to as Sin in the Hebrew Bible, was an ancient Egyptian city located in the northeastern Nile Delta, near the Mediterranean Sea. It is mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel as part of a prophecy against Egypt \(Ezek. 30:15-16\). Ezekiel foretells that God will pour out His wrath upon Sin \(Pelusium\) and cut off the multitude of No \(Thebes\), indicating that Pelusium would face divine judgment along with other major Egyptian cities. Historically, Pelusium served as a strategic frontier fortress and was known for its role in defending Egypt against foreign invasions. The city was also an important commercial center, situated at the crossroads of trade routes between Egypt, the Levant, and the Mediterranean world. Although the biblical references to Pelusium are limited, its inclusion in Ezekiel's prophecy highlights its significance in ancient Egypt.
