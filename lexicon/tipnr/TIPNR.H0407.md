Achshaph was a Canaanite city-state mentioned in the conquest narratives of the book of Joshua. Its king, along with other northern Canaanite kings, formed an alliance against Israel led by Jabin king of Hazor \([[Josh.11.1|Joshua 11:1]]\). However, Joshua defeated this coalition, capturing and destroying their cities, including Achshaph \([[Josh.11.1|Joshua 11:1]]0-23\). Achshaph is listed among the kings defeated by Joshua \([[Josh.12.20|Joshua 12:20]]\) and later allotted to the tribe of Asher \([[Josh.19.25|Joshua 19:25]]\). The exact location of Achshaph is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the western Galilee region, north of Mount Carmel.
