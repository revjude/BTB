- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Mark.15.21|Mrk.15.21]]; 
- only referred to as Rufus **<big>[[G4504|Ῥοῦφος]]</big>**; 
-  son of Simon **<big>[[G4613|Σίμων]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Alexander **<big>[[G0223|Ἀλέξανδρος]]</big>**.

Rufus is mentioned in [[Mark.15.21|Mark 15:21]] as the son of Simon of Cyrene, who was compelled by Roman soldiers to carry the cross of Jesus on the way to His crucifixion. Simon was from Cyrene, a city in present-day Libya, and he was visiting Jerusalem, likely for the Passover festival. The fact that Mark specifically names Rufus and his brother Alexander suggests that they were known to the early Christian community and may have become followers of Jesus. In Romans 16:13, Paul sends greetings to a man named Rufus, whom he describes as "chosen in the Lord," and to his mother, who had also been a mother figure to Paul. While it is not certain, some scholars believe that this Rufus could be the same person mentioned in Mark's Gospel, as the sons of Simon of Cyrene. If this is the case, it would indicate that Rufus not only witnessed the crucifixion of Jesus but also became a prominent member of the early church. However, due to the commonness of the name Rufus, this connection remains speculative.
