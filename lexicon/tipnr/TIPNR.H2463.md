Helbon was a city mentioned in [[Ezek.27.18|Ezekiel 27:18]] as one of the trading partners of Tyre, the ancient Phoenician city. It was particularly noted for its fine wine, which was highly prized and traded in the region. The exact location of Helbon is not certain, but it is believed to be modern-day Halbun, a village located about 11 miles north of Damascus, Syria. This identification is supported by the fact that the area around Halbun is still known for producing high-quality grapes and wine. Some scholars have suggested that Helbon might be the same as Aleppo \(Haleb\), but this is less likely given the distance between Aleppo and Damascus.
