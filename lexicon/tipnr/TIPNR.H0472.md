Elisheba is mentioned in the genealogy of the Levites as the wife of Aaron, the first High Priest of Israel \([[Exod.6.23|Exo.6.23]]\). She was the daughter of Amminadab and the sister of Nahshon, who was the leader of the tribe of Judah during the Exodus \(Num.1.7\). Elisheba married Aaron and bore him four sons: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. Her sons served as priests alongside their father, Aaron. Elisheba's marriage to Aaron highlights the connection between the priestly Levites and the royal tribe of Judah. The Bible does not provide any further details about Elisheba's life or her role as the wife of the High Priest.
