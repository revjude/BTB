Zabad, the son of Zattu, is mentioned in the list of men who had taken foreign wives during the Babylonian exile. This was discovered when Ezra, the priest and scribe, returned to Jerusalem and found that many Israelites had intermarried with the pagan peoples of the land. Zabad was one of those who had violated God's command not to intermarry with foreigners. In response to Ezra's call for repentance, Zabad and the others agreed to put away their foreign wives and children to maintain the purity of the Jewish people.
