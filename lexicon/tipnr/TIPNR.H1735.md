Dodavahu, son of Eliezer of Mareshah, is mentioned in [[2Chr.20.37|2 Chronicles 20:37]] as a prophet who rebuked King Jehoshaphat of Judah for his alliance with Ahaziah, the wicked king of Israel. This incident occurred after Jehoshaphat had successfully sought the Lord's help in defeating the Moabites and Ammonites \(2 Chronicles 20:1-30\). 

Following this victory, Jehoshaphat allied himself with Ahaziah to build ships to go to Tarshish \(2 Chronicles 20:35-36\). This alliance was ill-advised, as Ahaziah was known for his wickedness and had led Israel into idolatry \(1 Kings 22\).
