Lo-ruhamah was the symbolic name given to the daughter of the prophet Hosea and his wife Gomer \([[Hos.1.6|Hos.1.6]]\). The name Lo-ruhamah means "not pitied" or "not shown mercy" in Hebrew. This name, along with the names of Hosea's other children, Jezreel and Lo-ammi, was used by God to convey a message to the people of Israel. The name Lo-ruhamah symbolized God's decision to withdraw His mercy and compassion from Israel due to their persistent unfaithfulness \([[Hos.1.6|Hos.1.6]]\). God declared that He would no longer show love to the house of Israel or forgive them \([[Hos.1.6|Hos.1.6]],8\). This message was part of Hosea's prophecy, which called the Israelites to repentance and warned of the consequences of their disobedience. The symbolic names of Hosea's children served as a powerful visual reminder of God's judgment and the broken relationship between God and His people.
