Secu is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the context of Saul's pursuit of David \(1 Sam. 19:22\). When David fled from Saul's court, he sought refuge with the prophet Samuel in Ramah. Saul sent messengers to capture David, but when they encountered a group of prophets prophesying, they also began to prophesy. Saul then went to Ramah himself, and the Spirit of God came upon him, causing him to prophesy as well. 

As Saul continued his journey, he came to a place called Secu, where he inquired about the whereabouts of Samuel and David. The exact location of Secu is unknown, but it was likely in the vicinity of Ramah, a town in the territory of Benjamin, north of Jerusalem. 

The mention of Secu in this narrative highlights the extent of Saul's pursuit of David and the unusual circumstances that prevented him from apprehending his perceived rival. It also demonstrates the power of God's Spirit to intervene and protect His chosen servants.
