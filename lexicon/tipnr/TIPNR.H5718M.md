Adaiah is mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as an ancestor of Maaseiah, a leader who lived in Jerusalem during the post-exilic period \([[Neh.11.5|Nehemiah 11:5]]\). Maaseiah was among the descendants of Perez, the son of Judah, who settled in Jerusalem. 

The context of Adaiah's mention is the listing of the leaders and prominent figures who resided in Jerusalem after the rebuilding of the city wall. This resettlement was part of Nehemiah's efforts to repopulate and strengthen Jerusalem following the return from Babylonian exile. 

Adaiah's inclusion in the genealogy of Maaseiah suggests that he was a significant figure in the family lineage, although no specific details are provided about his life or role. The mention of his name serves to establish the ancestry of Maaseiah and to highlight the importance of family lineage in the records of the post-exilic community. 

As an ancestor of a prominent leader in Jerusalem, Adaiah's legacy would have been remembered and celebrated by his descendants. However, beyond this brief mention, no further information is given about his personal life or contributions to the community.
