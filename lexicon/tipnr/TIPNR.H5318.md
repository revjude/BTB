The waters of Nephtoah, also known as the fountain of Nephtoah, was a spring located on the border between the tribal territories of Judah and Benjamin \(Josh. 15:9; 18:15\). It was used as a reference point in defining the boundaries of these tribes during the allotment of the land under Joshua. The spring was situated northwest of Jerusalem, near the cities of Kiriath-jearim and Chesalon. Its exact location is uncertain, but it may be identified with modern-day Lifta, a spring-fed village near Jerusalem.
