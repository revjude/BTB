Rithmah was one of the places where the Israelites camped during their wilderness wanderings after the Exodus from Egypt. It is mentioned in the list of the Israelites' encampments in the book of Numbers, between Hazeroth and Rimmon-perez \(Num. 33:18-19\). The name Rithmah means "juniper" or "broom tree." No other details are provided about this location in the Bible, and its exact site remains unknown. It was likely situated somewhere in the Sinai Peninsula or the Negev desert.
