Eglon was the Amorite king of Lachish who joined an alliance against Israel during the conquest under Joshua. He allied with Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem, Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, and Debir king of Eglon to attack Gibeon for making a treaty with Israel \([[Josh.10.3|Joshua 10:3]]-5\). 

However, the Israelites came to Gibeon's aid and pursued the Amorite kings, defeating them with God's help. Eglon and the other kings fled and hid in a cave at Makkedah, but were captured and executed by Joshua \(Joshua 10:16-27\). Eglon's city of Lachish was also captured and destroyed.
