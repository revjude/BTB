Ethan the Ezrahite was a wise man during the time of King Solomon. He was known for his wisdom, although not as wise as Solomon himself \([[1Kgs.4.31|1 Kings 4:31]]\). Ethan was also a skilled musician and is credited with authoring Psalm 89, a psalm that reflects on God's covenant with David and the challenges faced by the Davidic dynasty \(Psalm 89:1\). The psalm demonstrates Ethan's deep understanding of God's faithfulness and sovereignty.
