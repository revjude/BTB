Shomer is described as a Moabite woman, indicating that she was a foreigner. Her son, along with another servant named Jehozabad, killed Joash while he was staying at the house of Millo. The assassination was motivated by revenge for the execution of the prophet Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, who had criticized Joash for abandoning the worship of God. The text does not provide any further details about Shomer's life or her role in the events surrounding her son's actions.
