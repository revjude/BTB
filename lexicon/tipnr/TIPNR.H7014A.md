Kain was a town located in the hill country of Judah \([[Josh.15.57|Joshua 15:57]]\). It is mentioned only once in the Bible, and no further information about its history or significance is provided. Some scholars suggest that Kain may be associated with the Kenites, a nomadic tribe mentioned in [[Num.24.22|Numbers 24:22]]. The Kenites were known for their association with the Israelites, particularly through Moses' father-in-law, Jethro \(Judges 1:16\). However, the connection between the town of Kain and the Kenites is not explicitly stated in the Bible. The exact location of Kain is unknown.
