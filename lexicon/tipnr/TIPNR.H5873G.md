En-gannim is mentioned in [[Josh.15.34|Joshua 15:34]] as one of the cities in the lowlands \(Shephelah\) of Judah. It is listed among other cities in this region, such as Zanoah, Eshtaol, and Zoreah. 

The name En-gannim means "spring of the gardens," suggesting the presence of a water source and fertile land nearby. Its exact location is unknown. 

It is important to note that there is another city named En-gannim mentioned in the Bible, located in the territory of Issachar \(Joshua 19:21\). These two cities should not be confused with each other.
