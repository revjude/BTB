Enam was a town located in the Shephelah, the lowland region of Judah, and was included in the list of towns allotted to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land under Joshua \(Jos. 15:34\). It is mentioned only once in the Bible, and no further details about its history, size, or significance are provided. Its inclusion in the list of Judahite towns suggests that it was one of the settlements that the tribe was responsible for occupying and defending. The Shephelah was known for its fertile soil and strategic location between the coastal plain and the Judean hills.
