Asahel was one of two individuals mentioned in Ezra 10 who opposed Ezra's plan to dissolve the mixed marriages among the Jewish people who had returned from Babylonian exile. When Ezra called for the people to separate from their foreign wives and children, Asahel and Jahzeiah stood against this decision. However, the assembly ultimately agreed with Ezra, and the mixed marriages were ended.
