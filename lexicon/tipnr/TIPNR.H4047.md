Magpiash is mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as one of the individuals who sealed the covenant during the time of Nehemiah \([[Neh.10.20|Neh.10.20]]\). After the return of the Jewish exiles from Babylon and the completion of the wall of Jerusalem, the people gathered to renew their commitment to God and His laws \(Neh.8-10\). As part of this renewal, a covenant document was prepared and signed by the leaders, Levites, and priests \(Neh.10.1-27\). Magpiash is listed among the leaders who sealed this covenant, pledging to follow God's commandments and to support the temple service \(Neh.10.28-39\). The sealing of the covenant was a significant act of dedication and commitment to God, demonstrating the people's desire to live according to His will in the post-exilic period. No further details are provided about Magpiash's personal life or his specific role in the community. His inclusion in the list of those who sealed the covenant highlights the importance of collective responsibility and unity in the spiritual life of the Jewish community.
