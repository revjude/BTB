Hadashah was a town mentioned in the list of cities and towns allotted to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land. It was located in the Shephelah, the lowland region between the central hill country of Judah and the coastal plain \([[Josh.15.37|Joshua 15:37]]\). The Shephelah was known for its fertile lands and was an important agricultural area. The mention of Hadashah in the list of Judah's towns suggests that it was a significant settlement in the region during the time of Joshua. However, apart from this single reference in the book of Joshua, no further information about Hadashah is provided in the Bible. Its exact location and history remain uncertain, as the town is not mentioned in any other biblical accounts or in known extra-biblical sources.
