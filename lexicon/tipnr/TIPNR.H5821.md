Azzan was an Israelite man from the tribe of Issachar. He is mentioned in [[Num.34.26|Numbers 34:26]] as the father of Paltiel. Paltiel was chosen as the leader from the tribe of Issachar to work with Eleazar the priest, Joshua, and one leader from each of the other tribes to divide the land of Canaan fairly among the Israelites. Being selected for this role suggests that Paltiel was respected within his tribe. By identifying Paltiel as the son of Azzan, the text implies that Azzan was also a man of good reputation.
