Jerimoth is mentioned in 2 Chronicles as one of the Levites who served as an overseer during the reign of King Hezekiah. When Hezekiah initiated a restoration of the temple and its services, he appointed Levites to oversee the collection and distribution of the tithes and offerings brought by the people. Jerimoth, along with several other Levites, was entrusted with this responsibility, ensuring that the contributions were properly managed and used for the support of the priests and Levites. This appointment demonstrates the important role of the Levites in the administration of the temple and the trust placed in them by the king.
