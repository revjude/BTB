Gaash is mentioned in the Bible as a mountain or hill located in the tribal territory of Ephraim, in the central region of Canaan. It is most notably associated with Joshua, the successor of Moses and the leader of the Israelites during the conquest of the Promised Land. 

According to [[Josh.24.30|Joshua 24:30]] and [[Judg.2.9|Judges 2:9]], after Joshua had led the Israelites into Canaan and divided the land among the tribes, he died at the age of 110 and was buried in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash. 

The specific location of Mount Gaash is not clearly identified in the Bible, but it is believed to have been situated in the vicinity of Timnath-serah, which is thought to be modern-day Khirbet Tibnah, located approximately 20 miles \(32 kilometers\) southwest of Shechem. 

In addition to being the burial place of Joshua, Mount Gaash is also mentioned in connection with two of David's mighty men. In [[2Sam.23.30|2 Samuel 23:30]] and [[1Chr.11.32|1 Chronicles 11:32]], Hiddai \(or Hurai\) of the brooks of Gaash is listed among the elite warriors who fought alongside David. This suggests that the region around Mount Gaash was known for its brave and skilled fighters. 

The mention of Mount Gaash in the Bible serves to underscore the importance of Joshua as a key figure in Israel's history and his significant role in leading the people into the Promised Land. The association of this location with Joshua's burial place and the homeland of some of David's mighty men highlights the enduring legacy of faith and courage that these individuals embodied.
