Tubal is mentioned in the Bible as a nation descended from Tubal, one of the sons of Japheth \(Gen. 10:2; 1 Chr. 1:5\). The Tubal people are associated with the Meshech people, and together they are known for their trading activities, particularly in slaves and bronze \(Ezek. 27:13\). In the prophecy of Ezekiel, Tubal is mentioned along with Meshech as one of the nations allied with Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal \(Ezek. 38:2-3; 39:1\). Gog and his allies, including Tubal, are prophesied to attack Israel in the latter days but will ultimately be defeated by God. The exact location of Tubal is uncertain, but it is generally associated with the region of eastern Anatolia \(modern-day Turkey\) and the southern Caucasus. Some scholars identify Tubal with the Tabali, a people group mentioned in Assyrian inscriptions. In [[Isa.66.19|Isaiah 66:19]], Tubal is listed among the distant nations to which God will send survivors to proclaim His glory, suggesting that the Tubal people will also have an opportunity to hear and respond to the message of salvation.
