Man living at the time of Divided Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Jabez</span>, who was more honorable than his brothers, cried out to God, who granted his request to enlarge his territory and keep him from harm \(1Ch.4.9-10\).
- A man from the tribe of Judah  living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at 1Ch.4.9; 
- only referred to as Jabez<[[H3258H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>ֵּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ץ</span>\); 
-  son of Koz<[[H6976G]]>\(?\); 
- a brother of Anub<[[H6036]]>\(?\), Zobebah<[[H6637]]>\(?\) and Harum<[[H2037]]>\(?\).

Jabez is mentioned in 1 Chronicles 4:9-10 as a descendant of Judah. He is described as being more honorable than his brothers, though the reason for this distinction is not given. 

The passage records a prayer of Jabez, in which he cries out to the God of Israel, saying, "Oh that you would bless me and enlarge my border, and that your hand might be with me, and that you would keep me from harm so that it might not bring me pain!" \([[1Chr.4.10|1Ch.4.10]], ESV\). The chronicler then notes that God granted his request. 

This brief account of Jabez provides a glimpse into the personal faith and prayer life of an individual during the time of the chronicler. Jabez's prayer reflects a desire for God's blessing, protection, and provision. His request for enlarged borders may indicate a desire for increased territory or influence. 

The fact that God granted Jabez's request suggests that his prayer was sincere and in line with God's will. This account serves as an encouragement to readers to bring their own requests to God in faith, trusting in His goodness and care.
