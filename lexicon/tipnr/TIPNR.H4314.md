Mezahab is mentioned in the genealogies of Esau in the book of Genesis and the book of Chronicles \([[Gen.36.39|Gen.36.39]]; [[1Chr.1.50|1Ch.1.50]]\). He was the father of Matred and the grandfather of Mehetabel, who became the wife of Hadar, the last king of Edom mentioned in these genealogies. No further information is given about Mezahab's life, occupation, or place of origin. His name, which means "waters of gold" or "gold waters" in Hebrew, may suggest some connection to a place known for its gold or water resources, but the Bible does not provide any details to confirm this.
