<small>*Male • Companion of Paul who later deserted him*</small>

Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Demas</span> was a companion of Paul who later deserted him because he loved the world. \([[Col.4.14|Col.4.14]]; [[2Tim.4.10|2Ti.4.10]]; [[Phlm.1.24|Phm.1.24]]\)
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Col.4.14|Col.4.14]]; 
- only referred to as Demas<[[G1214]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Δημᾶς</span>\).

Demas is mentioned in three of Paul's epistles as a companion and fellow worker in the ministry. In [[Col.4.14|Colossians 4:14]] and [[Phlm.1.24|Philemon 1:24]], Paul sends greetings from Demas, along with other believers such as Luke, Mark, and Aristarchus. This suggests that Demas was a valued member of Paul's ministry team during his imprisonment in Rome. 

However, in [[2Tim.4.10|2 Timothy 4:10]], Paul writes with a tone of disappointment, stating that Demas had forsaken him, "having loved this present world." This statement indicates that Demas had abandoned Paul and the ministry, choosing instead to pursue worldly interests. The exact nature of Demas' desertion is not specified, but it clearly caused Paul distress, especially as he faced his impending martyrdom. 

The contrast between Demas' earlier dedication and his later abandonment serves as a warning to believers about the allure of worldly pursuits and the importance of remaining faithful to Christ and His mission. Demas' story is a reminder that even those who have served alongside great leaders like Paul can fall away if they allow their love for the world to supersede their commitment to God.
