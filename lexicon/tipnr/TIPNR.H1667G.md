Gath-rimmon is mentioned in the Bible as a Levitical city, one of the towns set apart for the Levites to live in among the various tribal territories of Israel. The city is associated with two different tribes: Dan and Manasseh. 

In [[Josh.19.45|Joshua 19:45]], Gath-rimmon is listed among the cities allotted to the tribe of Dan in the coastal plain of Canaan. Later, in [[Josh.21.24|Joshua 21:24]] and [[1Chr.6.69|1 Chronicles 6:69]], it is mentioned as one of the cities given to the Kohathite Levites within the territory of Dan. 

However, in the parallel passage of 1 Chronicles 6:70, Gath-rimmon is also listed among the cities given to the Kohathite Levites within the territory of Manasseh. This apparent discrepancy may be due to textual errors or could indicate that there were two cities named Gath-rimmon, one in Dan and another in Manasseh. 

The Levites, who were not given a specific territorial inheritance like the other tribes, were distributed among the various tribes to serve as priests, teachers, and judges. The Levitical cities, such as Gath-rimmon, provided them with places to live and pasture lands for their livestock. 

The name Gath-rimmon is composed of two elements: "Gath," meaning "winepress," and "rimmon," which can mean "pomegranate" or "thunderbolt." This suggests that the city may have been known for its wine production or its location near a prominent pomegranate grove or a place associated with thunderstorms.
