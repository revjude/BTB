Shecaniah was an Israelite man living in the time of Ezra after the return from Babylonian exile. He is first mentioned in [[Ezra.10.2|Ezra 10:2]], where he speaks on behalf of the people in confessing that they had been unfaithful to God by marrying foreign women. Shecaniah proposes that the people make a covenant to send away these wives and their children. 

He is likely the same Shecaniah mentioned in [[Neh.3.29|Nehemiah 3:29]] as the son of Shemaiah. In this passage, he is recorded as making repairs to a section of the wall of Jerusalem near his house. This suggests he remained faithful to God and was trusted to help rebuild the city walls.
