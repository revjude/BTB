- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.24.7|1Ch.24.7]]; 
- only referred to as Jehoiarib **<big>[[H3080|יְהוֹיָרִיב]]</big>**.

Jehoiarib is mentioned in [[1Chr.24.7|1 Chronicles 24:7]] as the head of the first priestly division organized by King David. As part of David's reforms, the priests were divided into 24 groups to serve in the temple on a rotating basis. The order of service was determined by casting lots, and Jehoiarib's division was selected first. This suggests that Jehoiarib and his descendants held a prominent position among the priestly families. The text does not provide any further information about Jehoiarib's background or his specific role in the priestly duties. However, the organization of the priestly divisions was a significant step in establishing a structured and efficient system for temple service, ensuring that the worship of God was carried out regularly and in an orderly manner.
