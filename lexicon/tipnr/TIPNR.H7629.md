Shobi is mentioned in [[2Sam.17.27|2 Samuel 17:27]] as an Ammonite from Rabbah who, along with Machir and Barzillai, brought supplies to David and his followers at Mahanaim. This event occurred during the rebellion of David's son Absalom when David was forced to flee from Jerusalem. Shobi, despite being an Ammonite, showed kindness and support to David in his time of need. He provided beds, basins, pottery, wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils, honey, curds, sheep, and cheese for David and the people with him. This act of generosity was significant, as it demonstrated that David had allies and support even among the neighboring nations, and it helped sustain David and his followers during a challenging period of his reign.
