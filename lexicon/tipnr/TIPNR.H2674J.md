Hazor is mentioned in [[Neh.11.33|Nehemiah 11:33]] as one of the towns resettled by the Benjamites after their return from the Babylonian exile. It was likely located in the territory traditionally associated with the tribe of Benjamin, north of Jerusalem. This Hazor is distinct from the Canaanite city of Hazor in the north and the town of Hazor in the Negev region.
