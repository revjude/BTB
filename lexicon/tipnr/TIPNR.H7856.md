Sitnah is the name of a well that Isaac, the son of Abraham, dug in the Valley of Gerar during his sojourn in the land of the Philistines \(Gen. 26:21\). After the Philistines had stopped up the wells that Abraham's servants had dug, Isaac began to reopen them. He also dug new wells, including one he named Sitnah. 

The name "Sitnah" is derived from the Hebrew word "satan," meaning "accusation" or "enmity." This name was given to the well because the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen, claiming the water as their own. 

The dispute over the well at Sitnah was part of a larger pattern of conflict between Isaac and the Philistines. The Philistines, envious of Isaac's prosperity, had stopped up the wells and sent him away \(Gen. 26:14-16\). Despite these challenges, Isaac persisted in his efforts to establish himself in the land, trusting in God's promise to bless him and his descendants. 

The story of Isaac's wells, including Sitnah, illustrates the challenges faced by the patriarchs as they sought to maintain their presence in Canaan. It also highlights the importance of water rights in the semi-arid region and the potential for conflict over these valuable resources.
