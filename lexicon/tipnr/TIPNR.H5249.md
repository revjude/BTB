Nimrim was a place in the land of Moab, east of the Dead Sea. It is mentioned in the Bible in the context of prophetic oracles against Moab \(Isa. 15:6; Jer. 48:34\). The waters of Nimrim are described as being desolate or dried up, symbolizing the devastation that would come upon Moab as a result of God's judgment. The exact location of Nimrim is uncertain, but it was likely situated near a spring or stream that provided water for the surrounding area. The drying up of these waters would have had a significant impact on the local population and their livestock.
