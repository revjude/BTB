- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.18|Ezr.10.18]]; 
- only referred to as Gedaliah<[[H1436A]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ג</span>ְּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>\).

Gedaliah is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.18|Ezra 10:18]] as one of the priests who had married foreign women during the Babylonian exile. After the return from exile, Ezra, a scribe and priest, led a reform movement to address the issue of intermarriage between the Israelites and the surrounding nations \(Ezra 9:1-2\). Ezra called for a assembly of all the returned exiles in Jerusalem, where he confronted them about their unfaithfulness and urged them to separate themselves from the foreign wives \(Ezra 10:10-11\). Gedaliah, along with several other priests, was found guilty of this offense \([[Ezra.10.18|Ezra 10:18]]\). In response to Ezra's call for repentance, Gedaliah and the others pledged to put away their foreign wives and offered a ram from the flock as a guilt offering \(Ezra 10:19\). This incident highlights the importance of maintaining religious and ethnic purity among the Israelites, especially for the priests who were responsible for leading the people in worship and obedience to God's law.
