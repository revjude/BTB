Ashnah is the name of two cities mentioned in the book of Joshua as part of the territorial allotment given to the tribe of Judah. Both cities were located in the Shephelah, the lowland region situated between the coastal plain and the Judean hills. 

The first Ashnah is listed in [[Josh.15.33|Joshua 15:33]] among the cities in the northern part of the Shephelah, along with Eshtaol, Zorah, and others. This group of cities was located near the border with the tribe of Dan. 

The second Ashnah is mentioned in [[Josh.15.43|Joshua 15:43]], grouped with cities such as Jiphtah, Ashnah, and Nezib in the southern part of the Shephelah. This cluster of cities was situated closer to the Negev region. 

Apart from their inclusion in the lists of Judah's cities, no other information is provided about either of the Ashnahs in the Bible. Their mention in the context of the tribal allotment highlights the process of dividing and assigning the conquered territories among the tribes of Israel. 

The exact locations of the two Ashnahs are uncertain, and they are not mentioned in any other biblical narratives or historical accounts. Their presence in the lists of Judah's cities underscores the thoroughness and detail of the territorial descriptions in the book of Joshua.
