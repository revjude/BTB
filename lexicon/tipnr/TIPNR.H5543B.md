Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Sallu</span> \(or Sallai\) was a priest who returned from the Babylonian exile with Zerubbabel and later signed the covenant under Nehemiah.
- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Neh.12.7|Neh.12.7]]; 
- referred to as Sallu **<big>[[H5543|סַלּוּ]]</big>**, or Sallai \(NIV= Sallu\)  **<big>[[H5543|סַלּוּ]]</big>**.

Sallu \(or Sallai\) is mentioned in [[Neh.12.7|Nehemiah 12:7]] and 12:20 as one of the priests who returned from the Babylonian exile with Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah. Zerubbabel led the first group of exiles back to Jerusalem, as recorded in Ezra 2 and Nehemiah 7. Sallu is listed among the priests who were heads of their fathers' houses during the time of Jeshua, the high priest \([[Neh.12.7|Nehemiah 12:7]]\). Later, during the time of Joiakim, who succeeded Jeshua as high priest, Sallu is mentioned again as the head of his father's house \([[Neh.12.20|Nehemiah 12:20]]\). This suggests that Sallu and his descendants continued to serve as priests in the restored community in Jerusalem. The return of the priests, including Sallu, was crucial for the reestablishment of temple worship and religious life in Jerusalem after the exile.
