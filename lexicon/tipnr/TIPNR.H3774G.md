The Cherethites were a Philistine tribe mentioned in several passages in the Old Testament. In [[1Sam.30.14|1 Samuel 30:14]], they are described as living in the Negev region, and their territory was raided by the Amalekites. The Cherethites, along with the Pelethites, often served as royal guards and soldiers for Israelite kings, particularly during the reigns of David and Solomon \(2 Samuel 8:18; 15:18; 20:7; 1 Kings 1:38,44\). In prophetic oracles, [[Ezek.25.16|Ezekiel 25:16]] and [[Zeph.2.5|Zephaniah 2:5]] mention the Cherethites as one of the Philistine groups facing God's judgment for their hostility towards Israel. The Cherethites are closely associated with the Philistines and were likely one of the major Philistine tribes settled in Canaan.
