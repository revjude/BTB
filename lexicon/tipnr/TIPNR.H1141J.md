- A singer living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Chr.15.18|1Ch.15.18]]; 
- only referred to as Benaiah **<big>[[H1141|בְּנָיָה]]</big>**.

Benaiah is mentioned in 1 Chronicles 15-16 as one of the Levites who participated in the transfer of the ark of the covenant from the house of Obed-edom to Jerusalem during the reign of King David. In [[1Chr.15.18|1 Chronicles 15:18]] and 20, Benaiah is listed among the Levites who were appointed to play the lyre, along with other musicians. This suggests that he was skilled in music and had a designated role in the worship and celebration surrounding the ark. In [[1Chr.15.24|1 Chronicles 15:24]], Benaiah is also mentioned as one of the gatekeepers for the ark, responsible for its security and proper handling. During the celebration after the ark's successful transfer, Benaiah is once again mentioned as a musician, playing the lyre before the ark \([[1Chr.16.5|1 Chronicles 16:5]]-6\). These passages highlight Benaiah's multifaceted role as a Levite, serving as both a musician and a gatekeeper in the context of the ark's transfer and the accompanying worship.
