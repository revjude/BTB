Seirah is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the context of Ehud's assassination of Eglon, the king of Moab \(Judg. 3:26\). After killing Eglon, Ehud escaped and passed beyond the idols near Gilgal, reaching Seirah. From there, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, rallying the Israelites to battle against the Moabites. The exact location of Seirah is unknown, but it was likely situated in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Gilgal. The name "Seirah" may be derived from the Hebrew word "se'ar," meaning "hairy" or "shaggy," possibly referring to the wooded nature of the area.
