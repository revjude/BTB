Japhlet is mentioned in [[1Chr.7.32|1 Chronicles 7:32]]-33 as one of the sons of Heber, who was a descendant of Asher, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. Japhlet had three sons: Pasach, Bimhal, and Ashvath. The text does not provide any further details about Japhlet's life or his role within the tribe of Asher. His mention in the genealogy suggests that he was an ancestor of some of the families within the tribe, although no specific details are given about his descendants. In [[Josh.16.3|Joshua 16:3]], a place called the "border of Beth-horon the lower" is described as extending to the "border of the Japhletites," possibly indicating that Japhlet's descendants inhabited a specific region within the territory of Asher.
