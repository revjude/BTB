Jerioth is mentioned briefly in the genealogy of Judah in 1 Chronicles as one of the wives of Caleb, the son of Hezron. The passage states that Caleb had children by his wife Azubah, and after her death, he married Ephrath. It then mentions that Caleb also had children by Jerioth. The wording at 1Chr.2.18 makes it possible this was another name for Azubah who had Jesher, Shobab, and Ardon.
