Rephaiah is mentioned in [[1Chr.4.42|1 Chronicles 4:42]] as one of the leaders of the Simeonites who led an expedition against the Amalekites during the reign of King Hezekiah. The Simeonites, descendants of Simeon, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, sought to expand their territory. Rephaiah, along with Pelatiah, Neariah, and Uzziel, led 500 men to Mount Seir, where they attacked and defeated the remnant of the Amalekites who had escaped earlier conflicts with Israel. The Simeonites then settled in the conquered territory. This event demonstrates the ongoing conflicts between Israel and its enemies and the efforts of the tribes to secure their inheritance in the Promised Land.
