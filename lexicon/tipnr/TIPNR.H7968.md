Shallum, mentioned in [[Neh.3.15|Nehemiah 3:15]], was the son of Col-hozeh and the ruler of the district of Mizpah during the time of Nehemiah. He played a significant role in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls, specifically focusing on the restoration of the Fountain Gate and the wall of the Pool of Shelah \(also known as the King's Pool\). Shallum's leadership position as the ruler of Mizpah suggests that he had authority and responsibility over the region. His involvement in the rebuilding project demonstrates his commitment to the restoration of Jerusalem and his willingness to contribute to the collective effort. The Fountain Gate and the Pool of Shelah were important landmarks in Jerusalem, and their repair under Shallum's supervision helped to strengthen the city's defenses and improve its water supply.
