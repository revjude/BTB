- A woman living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Luke.2.36|Luk.2.36]]; 
- only referred to as Anna **<big>[[G0451|Ἄννα]]</big>**; 
- a daughter of Phanuel **<big>[[G5323|Φανουήλ]]</big>**.

Anna was a prophetess mentioned in the Gospel of Luke. She was the daughter of Phanuel, from the tribe of Asher. At the time of Jesus' birth, Anna was an elderly widow who had been married for seven years before her husband died, and she had remained a widow for eighty-four years. She was known for her devotion to God, as she never left the temple but worshiped day and night, fasting and praying. 

When Mary and Joseph brought the infant Jesus to the temple to dedicate Him according to the law, Anna was present. Upon seeing Jesus, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem. Her prophetic insight allowed her to recognize Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah, and she shared this knowledge with others who were eagerly anticipating God's redemptive work through Him.
