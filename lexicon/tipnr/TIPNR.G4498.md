- A woman living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Luke.3.27|Act.12.13]]; 
- only referred to as Rhoda **<big>[[G4498|Ῥόδη]]</big>**.

Rhoda was a servant girl who lived in the house of Mary, the mother of John Mark, in Jerusalem \(Acts 12:13\). During the reign of King Herod Agrippa I, the apostle Peter was imprisoned for his faith \(Acts 12:1-4\). The church gathered at Mary's house to pray earnestly for Peter's safety and release \(Acts 12:5, 12\). One night, as they were praying, an angel miraculously freed Peter from prison, and he made his way to Mary's house \(Acts 12:6-11\). When Peter knocked at the gate, Rhoda went to answer \(Acts 12:13\). Upon recognizing Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed that she forgot to open the gate and ran back inside to tell the others that Peter was standing outside \(Acts 12:14\). Initially, the people inside did not believe her, thinking she was out of her mind or that it was Peter's angel \(Acts 12:15\). However, when Peter continued knocking, they opened the door and were astonished to see him \(Acts 12:16\). Rhoda's role in this account highlights the power of prayer and the unexpected ways in which God can answer the prayers of His people. Her joyful response to Peter's presence also demonstrates the love and unity among the early believers, even in the face of persecution.
