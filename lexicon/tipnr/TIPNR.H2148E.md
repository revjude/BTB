Zechariah, the son of Isshiah, is mentioned in the genealogical records of the Levites during the time of King David. He belonged to the family of Kohath, one of the three main divisions of the Levites. The Kohathites were responsible for the care and transportation of the sacred objects of the tabernacle. In the organization of the Levitical duties by David, the descendants of Kohath were assigned specific roles and responsibilities. Zechariah's mention in this context suggests that he and his family line were part of the Levitical service in the tabernacle during David's reign.
