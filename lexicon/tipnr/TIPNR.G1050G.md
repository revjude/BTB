- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[3John.1.1|Act.19.29]]; 
- only referred to as Gaius<[[G1050G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Γά</span>ϊ<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>ος</span>\).

Gaius, a Macedonian, was one of Paul's traveling companions during his third missionary journey. In Acts 19:29, Gaius and Aristarchus, another Macedonian, were seized by the mob during the riot in Ephesus. The riot was instigated by Demetrius, a silversmith who made shrines of Artemis, because he felt threatened by Paul's preaching and the spread of Christianity in the city. The mob dragged Gaius and Aristarchus into the theater, but Paul was prevented from entering by his disciples and some officials of the province of Asia who were his friends. The incident highlights the opposition and dangers faced by Paul and his companions as they spread the gospel in pagan cities.
