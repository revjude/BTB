Rahab was a Canaanite woman who lived in Jericho at the time of the Israelites' conquest of the Promised Land \([[Josh.2.1|Joshua 2:1]]\). She is described as a prostitute who provided lodging for the two Israelite spies sent by Joshua to survey the city. When the king of Jericho ordered Rahab to hand over the spies, she hid them on her roof and misdirected the king's men \([[Josh.2.3|Joshua 2:3]]-7\). Rahab acknowledged the God of Israel and asked for protection for herself and her family when the city would be taken \(Joshua 2:8-13\). The spies agreed to spare her if she would tie a scarlet cord in her window \([[Josh.2.1|Joshua 2:1]]4-21\). During the conquest of Jericho, Rahab and her family were saved as promised \([[Josh.6.17|Joshua 6:17]], 23, 25\). Rahab's faith and actions are commended in the New Testament \([[Heb.11.31|Hebrews 11:31]]; [[Jas.2.25|James 2:25]]\). She is also mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus, indicating that she married Salmon and became an ancestor of King David and Jesus Christ \([[Matt.1.5|Matthew 1:5]]\).
