Ijon, also known as Jaan, was a town located in the northern part of Israel, in the territory of Naphtali. It was conquered by Ben-hadad, king of Aram, at the request of King Asa of Judah, who sought to divert the attention of Baasha, king of Israel \([[1Kgs.15.20|1 Kings 15:20]]; [[2Chr.16.4|2 Chronicles 16:4]]\). Later, during the reign of Pekah, king of Israel, Ijon was captured by the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser, who deported its inhabitants to Assyria \([[2Kgs.15.29|2 Kings 15:29]]\). The town is also mentioned in the account of David's census \([[2Sam.24.6|2 Samuel 24:6]]\). Its exact location is uncertain, but it was likely situated near the border with Aram \(Syria\) in the upper Jordan Valley.
