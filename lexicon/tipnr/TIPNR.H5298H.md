Nepheg was one of the sons of King David, born to him in Jerusalem, as recorded in [[2Sam.5.15|2 Samuel 5:15]] and [[1Chr.3.7|1 Chronicles 3:7]] and 14:6. He was among the children born to David after he had conquered Jerusalem and established it as his capital city. 

The mention of Nepheg in these passages occurs in the context of listing David's sons born in Jerusalem. These sons were born to David by his wives, whom he had taken after becoming king over all Israel. 

As a son of David, Nepheg would have been part of the royal family and would have grown up in the palace in Jerusalem. However, beyond his inclusion in the list of David's sons, no further details are provided about Nepheg's life, character, or role in the kingdom. 

The biblical record does not mention any significant events or accomplishments associated with Nepheg, and he does not appear to have played a prominent role in the history of Israel. This is in contrast to some of his brothers, such as Solomon, who succeeded David as king, and Absalom, who led a rebellion against his father. 

Nepheg's inclusion in the genealogical record of David's sons serves to provide a complete account of the royal family and to highlight the fulfillment of God's promise to David that he would establish his throne forever \(2 Samuel 7:12-16\). The mention of Nepheg and his brothers also underscores the importance of family lineage in the Israelite monarchy and the continuation of the Davidic dynasty.
