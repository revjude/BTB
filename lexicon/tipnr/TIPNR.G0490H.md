Antioch in Pisidia, also known as Pisidian Antioch, was a city located in the region of Pisidia in Asia Minor \(modern-day Turkey\). It is mentioned in the New Testament in connection with Paul's missionary journeys. During Paul's first missionary journey, he and Barnabas visited Antioch in Pisidia, where Paul preached in the synagogue on the Sabbath \(Acts 13:14-41\). 

Paul's message in the synagogue focused on Jesus as the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel and the offer of forgiveness of sins through faith in Him. While some of the Jews and proselytes believed, others rejected the message and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, forcing them to leave the city \(Acts 13:42-52\). 

Later, on their return journey, Paul and Barnabas revisited Antioch in Pisidia, strengthening the disciples and appointing elders in the church \(Acts 14:21-23\). However, the city continued to be a place of opposition, as Jews from Antioch and Iconium followed Paul and Barnabas to Lystra, where they stoned Paul and left him for dead \(Acts 14:19-20\). 

In his second letter to Timothy, Paul mentions the persecutions and sufferings he endured in Antioch, along with Iconium and Lystra, highlighting the challenges he faced while preaching the gospel in these cities \([[2Tim.3.11|2 Timothy 3:11]]\). 

The events in Antioch in Pisidia demonstrate the mixed response to the gospel message, with some embracing it and others violently opposing it. Despite the difficulties, the church in Antioch in Pisidia was established and strengthened through Paul's ministry.
