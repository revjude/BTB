This chapter describes the grand celebration that took place after the completion of the city's fortifications, with two large choirs marching on top of the walls and giving thanks to God. Jehohanan is listed among the priests who were involved in this ceremony, along with other notable figures such as Maaseiah, Shemaiah, and Eleazar.
