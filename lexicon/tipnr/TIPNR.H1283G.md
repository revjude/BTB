Beriah was a son of Asher, one of the twelve sons of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) \(Gen. 46:17\). He was born to Asher in Canaan before the family migrated to Egypt. Beriah became the head of a clan within the tribe of Asher \(Num. 26:44-45\). His descendants, known as the Beriites, were among the clans that formed the tribe of Asher during the time of Moses and the conquest of Canaan \(1 Ch. 7:30-31\). The inclusion of Beriah and his clan in the genealogies and census records of Israel demonstrates the importance of family lineage and tribal organization in Israelite society.
