<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Cozbi</span>, a Midianite woman, was killed along with an Israelite man for their immorality. \([[Num.25.15|Num.25.15]],18\)
- A woman living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Num.25.15|Num.25.15]]; 
- only referred to as Cozbi **<big>[[H3579|כֹּזְבִי]]</big>**; 
- a daughter of Zur **<big>[[H6698|צוּר]]</big>**.

Cozbi was a Midianite woman, the daughter of Zur, a tribal head in Midian. During Israel's stay in Shittim, Cozbi engaged in sexual immorality with Zimri, an Israelite man from the tribe of Simeon. This act of defiance against God's commands occurred in the sight of Moses and the entire congregation of Israel, who were weeping at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting due to a plague that had broken out as a result of the people's immorality and idolatry. 

Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron the priest, took a spear and followed Zimri into his tent, where he found him with Cozbi. Phinehas drove the spear through both of them, killing them and halting the plague that had claimed the lives of 24,000 Israelites. God commended Phinehas for his zeal and granted him a covenant of perpetual priesthood. 

Cozbi's name is mentioned again in [[Num.25.18|Numbers 25:18]], where God instructs Moses to treat the Midianites as enemies and attack them because of their treachery and the incident involving Cozbi, which led Israel into sin.
