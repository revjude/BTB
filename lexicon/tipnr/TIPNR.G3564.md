- A woman living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Col.4.15|Col.4.15]]; 
- only referred to as Nympha<[[G3564]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Νυμφᾶς</span>\).

Nympha was a Christian woman who lived in Laodicea during the time of Paul's ministry. She hosted a church in her house \([[Col.4.15|Colossians 4:15]]\). House churches were common in the early Christian era, as believers often gathered in homes for worship, prayer, and fellowship. Paul sent greetings to Nympha and the church that met in her home, indicating her significant role in the Christian community of Laodicea. The fact that the church is mentioned in connection with her name suggests that she was a prominent member and possibly a leader of the congregation.
