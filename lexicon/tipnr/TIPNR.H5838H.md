Azariah, the son of Nathan, is mentioned in [[1Kgs.4.5|1 Kings 4:5]] as one of the officials in King Solomon's court. He is described as being "over the officers," suggesting that he held a supervisory role over other officials in the royal administration. The fact that Azariah is specifically identified as the son of Nathan indicates that his father was likely a prominent figure, possibly the same Nathan who was a prophet during the reigns of David and Solomon. Azariah's position in the court demonstrates the importance of having trusted and capable individuals to assist in the governance of the kingdom. As an official under Solomon, Azariah would have been involved in implementing the king's policies and overseeing various aspects of the kingdom's administration.
