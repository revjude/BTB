<small>*Male • Governor of Samaria during Ahab's reign*</small>

Man living at the time of Divided Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Amon</span> was the governor of Samaria during the reign of King Ahab of Israel.
- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Kgs.22.26|1Ki.22.26]]; 
- only referred to as Amon<[[H0526G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>מו</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ן</span>\).

Amon was the governor of the city of Samaria during the reign of King Ahab of Israel. When the prophet Micaiah prophesied against Ahab, the king ordered Amon to put Micaiah in prison and feed him only bread and water until Ahab returned safely from battle. This event demonstrates Ahab's rejection of the true prophetic message and his preference for the false prophets who spoke favorably of him.
