Oboth was a place where the Israelites camped during their wilderness wanderings after the Exodus from Egypt \(Num. 21:10-11; 33:43-44\). It was located in the region east of Moab, near the border of the Amorite territory. The Israelites arrived at Oboth after traveling from Punon and before moving on to Iye-abarim in the wilderness east of Moab \(Num. 33:43-44\). Its location is unknown.
