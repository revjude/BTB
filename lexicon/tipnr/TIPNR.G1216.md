<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Demetrius</span>, a silversmith in Ephesus, stirred up opposition against Paul because his preaching threatened the business of making shrines of Artemis. \([[Phlm.1.24|Act.19.24]],38\)
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Phlm.1.24|Act.19.24]]; 
- only referred to as Demetrius **<big>[[G1216|Δημήτριος]]</big>**.

Demetrius is mentioned in Acts 19 as a silversmith in Ephesus who crafted silver shrines of the goddess Artemis. When Paul's preaching of the gospel led many people to turn away from worshipping Artemis, Demetrius gathered his fellow craftsmen and incited a riot against Paul and his companions. 

Demetrius argued that Paul's teaching threatened not only their livelihood but also the reputation of the temple of Artemis, which was renowned throughout Asia and the world \(Acts 19:24-27\). His speech roused the crowd, who began shouting, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!" The city was thrown into confusion, and Paul's companions, Gaius and Aristarchus, were dragged into the theater. 

The riot was eventually quelled by the city clerk, who reminded the crowd that Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen had legal recourse if they had a complaint against anyone \(Acts 19:38\). He also warned them about the consequences of their unlawful assembly. 

The incident with Demetrius highlights the economic and religious challenges that early Christians faced as the gospel spread and confronted deeply entrenched pagan beliefs and practices. It also demonstrates the power of the gospel to transform lives and the opposition that often arises when the message of Christ threatens the status quo.
