- A man living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.36.40|Gen.36.40]]; 
- referred to as Alvah or Alvah \(=Qere. Ketiv= Aliah, KJV= Aliah\) <[[H5933]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ו</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>\).

Alvah is mentioned in the genealogies of Esau, the son of Isaac and the brother of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\), who became the ancestor of the Edomites. He is listed as one of the chiefs of Edom, descended from Esau through his son Eliphaz. \([[Gen.36.40|Gen.36.40]]; [[1Chr.1.51|1Ch.1.51]]\) 

The genealogy in Genesis 36 and 1 Chronicles 1 traces the descendants of Esau and their settlement in the region of Seir, which later became known as Edom. It provides a record of the chiefs and clans that emerged from Esau's lineage. 

Apart from being listed as an Edomite chief, no further details are provided about Alvah's life, his role within the clan, or any significant events associated with him. 

The mention of Alvah in the genealogies serves to document the growth and organization of the Edomite people, who became a significant nation in the region. It also highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants, including those through Esau, would become great nations.
