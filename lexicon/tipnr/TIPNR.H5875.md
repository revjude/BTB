En-hakkore, meaning "spring of the caller," is the name given to a spring that miraculously appeared to quench Samson's thirst after his victory over the Philistines at Lehi \([[Judg.15.19|Judges 15:19]]\). 

After Samson had killed a thousand Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey, he became extremely thirsty and called out to the Lord for help. In response, God split open a hollow place in Lehi, and water came out of it. Samson drank from this spring, and his strength was restored. He named the spring En-hakkore, acknowledging that it was God who had answered his call for help. 

The exact location of En-hakkore is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely in the vicinity of Lehi, which is believed to be in the Judean foothills, near the border between Judah and Philistia. The appearance of this spring was a miraculous provision from God, demonstrating His care for Samson and His power to sustain His chosen people.
