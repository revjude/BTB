Man living at the time of Divided Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Hushim</span>, a son of Aher, is mentioned in the genealogy of the tribe of Dan in 1 Chronicles.
- A man from the tribe of Benjamin  living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.7.12|1Ch.7.12]]; 
- only referred to as Hushim **<big>[[H2366|חוּשִׁים]]</big>**; 
- a son of Aher **<big>[[H0313|אַחֵר]]</big>**.

Hushim is mentioned in [[1Chr.7.12|1 Chronicles 7:12]] as a son of Aher, who was from the tribe of Dan. The verse states, "Shuppim also, and Huppim were the sons of Ir, and Hushim was the son of Aher." 

This genealogical record is part of a larger listing of the descendants of the twelve tribes of Israel in 1 Chronicles. The tribe of Dan, one of the twelve tribes, is mentioned in this context. 

However, the identity of Aher is unclear, as this name does not appear elsewhere in the Bible. Some scholars suggest that Aher may be a reference to the tribe of Dan itself or a clan within the tribe. 

The mention of Hushim as a son of Aher may indicate that he was a significant figure within the tribe of Dan or that his descendants formed a notable clan within the tribe. 

Apart from this brief mention in the genealogy, no other information is provided about Hushim, son of Aher, in the Bible. The genealogies in Chronicles serve to establish the family lines and connections within the tribes of Israel, particularly in the post-exilic period when the Israelites were seeking to reestablish their identity as a nation.
