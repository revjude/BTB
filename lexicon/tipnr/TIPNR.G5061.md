- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Rom.16.22|Act.24.1]]; 
- only referred to as Tertullus<[[G5061]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Τέρτυλλος</span>\).

Tertullus is mentioned in Acts 24:1-2 as a lawyer or orator hired by the Jewish high priest and elders to present their case against the Apostle Paul before the Roman governor Felix in Caesarea. Tertullus began his speech with flattery, praising Felix's reforms and administration. He then accused Paul of being a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews, and profaning the temple. Tertullus aimed to persuade Felix to condemn Paul, but Paul defended himself by denying the charges and asserting his innocence. The outcome of the trial is not directly stated, but Paul remained in custody for two years until Felix's successor Porcius Festus took office.
