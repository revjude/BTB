Joel is mentioned in [[1Chr.5.8|1 Chronicles 5:8]] as a chief of the tribe of Gad. He is described as the son of Shema and the brother of Shapham. The Gadites, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, settled in the region of Bashan, east of the Jordan River. Joel and his clan lived in this area during the reign of Jotham, king of Judah, and Jeroboam, king of Israel. The mention of these kings helps to establish the historical context and timeframe for Joel's leadership among the Gadites.
