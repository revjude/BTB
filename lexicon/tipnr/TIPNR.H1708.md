Dabbesheth is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Josh.19.11|Joshua 19:11]], as a town situated on the border of the territory allocated to the tribe of Zebulun during the division of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel. 

The verse states that the border of Zebulun "turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrise to the border of Chisloth-tabor; it went out to Dabbesheth, and went up to Japhia." This description places Dabbesheth in the vicinity of Chisloth-tabor and Japhia, likely in the region of Lower Galilee. 

No further details are provided about Dabbesheth in the biblical text, such as its exact location, history, or significance. Its inclusion in the border description of Zebulun's territory suggests that it was a recognized landmark or settlement during the time of Joshua and the conquest of Canaan. 

The meaning of the name Dabbesheth is uncertain, and the lack of additional information in the Bible or other historical sources makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the town's role or character.
