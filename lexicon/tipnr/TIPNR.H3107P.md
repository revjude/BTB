- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.8.7|Neh.8.7]]; 
- only referred to as Jozabad<[[H3107P]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יו</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ז</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>\).

Jozabad is mentioned in [[Neh.8.7|Nehemiah 8:7]] as one of the Levites who helped the people understand the Law of Moses as it was being read aloud by Ezra. The context of the passage is the public reading of the Law during the Feast of Tabernacles, after the Israelites had returned from Babylonian exile \(Nehemiah 8:1-18\). 

As Ezra read from the Book of the Law, the Levites, including Jozabad, instructed the people and helped them understand the meaning of the text \([[Neh.8.7|Nehemiah 8:7]]-8\). This involved translating or explaining the Law, as many of the people may have been unfamiliar with the original Hebrew after years in exile. 

The Levites' role in teaching and interpreting the Law was crucial for the spiritual renewal of the Israelites as they sought to re-establish their covenant relationship with God.
