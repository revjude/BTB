- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.53|Ezr.2.53]]; 
- only referred to as Sisera<[[H5516H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ס</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יס</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>\).

Sisera is mentioned in [[Ezra.2.53|Ezra 2:53]] and [[Neh.7.55|Nehemiah 7:55]] as the ancestor of a family of temple servants \(Nethinim\) who were among the exiles that returned to Jerusalem from Babylon. The temple servants were a group of people assigned to assist the Levites in the maintenance and service of the temple. Sisera's descendants are listed among the temple servants who returned to Jerusalem, indicating that they had a hereditary role in serving at the temple. The return of Sisera's family, along with other exiles, was part of the restoration of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the temple after the Babylonian captivity. This Sisera should not be confused with the Canaanite commander mentioned in the book of Judges.
