Zaccur was a Levite belonging to the family of Merari. He was one of the sons of Jaaziah, as listed in the genealogy of the Levites during the time of King David. The Merarites were one of the three main divisions of the Levites, along with the Kohathites and Gershonites. They were responsible for the tabernacle's structural components and transportation during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness. Zaccur's mention in this genealogy highlights the importance of the Levitical lineage and their roles in Israelite worship.
