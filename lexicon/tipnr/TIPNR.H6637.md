Zobebah is mentioned in [[1Chr.4.8|1 Chronicles 4:8]] as one of the sons of Koz, who was a descendant of Judah. The name Zobebah appears in a genealogical list of the families of Judah, specifically in the lineage of Ashhur, the father of Tekoa. The passage lists several individuals, including Koz and his sons, but does not provide any additional details about their lives or roles within the tribe of Judah. The inclusion of Zobebah in this genealogy suggests that he was a significant figure within his family or clan, but the lack of further information leaves his specific contributions or achievements unknown.
