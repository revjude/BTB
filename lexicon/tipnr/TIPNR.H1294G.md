- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.12.3|1Ch.12.3]]; 
- only referred to as Beracah **<big>[[H1294|בְּרָכָה]]</big>**.

Beracah was a Benjamite warrior who joined David at Ziklag when David was fleeing from King Saul \(1 Ch. 12:3\). He was among the skilled archers and slingers who came to support David during this difficult time. These men, described as "brave warriors ready for battle and able to handle the shield and spear" \(1 Ch. 12:8\), played a crucial role in David's rise to power and the establishment of his kingdom. Beracah's allegiance to David demonstrates the growing support for the future king, even from those within Saul's own tribe of Benjamin.
