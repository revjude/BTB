Samos is a Greek island located in the eastern Aegean Sea, near the coast of modern-day Turkey. In the Bible, Samos is mentioned only once, in the context of Paul's third missionary journey. Acts 20:15 records that Paul and his companions, after leaving Miletus, arrived at Samos and stayed there for a night before proceeding to Miletus. Samos was known in ancient times for its strategic location, its fertile land, and its cultural achievements. The island was an important center of trade and learning, and it was the birthplace of several notable philosophers, mathematicians, and artists. Paul's brief stop at Samos demonstrates the extent of his travels and the strategic importance of the island as a transit point in the Aegean Sea.
