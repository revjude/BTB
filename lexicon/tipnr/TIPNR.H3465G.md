The Yeshanah Gate, also referred to as the Old Gate, was one of the gates in the wall of Jerusalem mentioned in the Book of Nehemiah. During the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls, Jehoiada, the son of Paseah, and Meshullam, the son of Besodeiah, repaired the Yeshanah Gate \(Neh. 3:6\). They laid its beams and hung its doors with its bolts and bars. The Yeshanah Gate is also mentioned in [[Neh.12.39|Nehemiah 12:39]], where it is listed among the gates and landmarks along the route of the dedication procession for the rebuilt walls. The exact location of the Yeshanah Gate is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated on the northern side of Jerusalem. The name "Yeshanah" means "old" in Hebrew, suggesting that this gate may have been one of the older entrances to the city or that it led to an older part of Jerusalem. The restoration of the Yeshanah Gate, along with the other gates and walls, was a significant part of Nehemiah's efforts to strengthen and secure Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile.
