Accad is mentioned in [[Gen.10.10|Genesis 10:10]] as one of the four cities that formed the core of Nimrod's kingdom in Shinar \(Babylonia\). The other cities were Babel, Erech, and Calneh. Accad is generally identified with the ancient city of Akkad, which was the capital of the Akkadian Empire founded by Sargon the Great around 2334 BC. The exact location of Akkad is unknown, but it was likely situated somewhere in northern Babylonia. The reference to Accad in Genesis 10 is part of the "Table of Nations" which describes the spread of Noah's descendants after the Flood. It shows that Nimrod, a descendant of Ham, established a powerful kingdom in Mesopotamia in the generations following the Flood.
