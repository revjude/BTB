Joktheel was a town located in the Shephelah, the lowland region of Judah, according to [[Josh.15.38|Joshua 15:38]]. It was part of the inheritance given to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land. The town is mentioned only once in the Bible, and no additional information about its history or significance is provided. Its exact location is unknown, but it was likely situated in the western foothills of Judah, between the coastal plain and the Judean mountains.
