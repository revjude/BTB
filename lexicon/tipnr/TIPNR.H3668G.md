Zedekiah son of Chenaanah was a false prophet who lived during the reign of King Ahab of Israel. He is mentioned in the context of the battle at Ramoth-gilead, where he, along with other false prophets, encouraged Ahab to go to war against the Arameans. Zedekiah made iron horns and claimed that Ahab would gore the Arameans until they were destroyed. When the true prophet Micaiah prophesied Ahab's defeat, Zedekiah struck him on the cheek and questioned the source of his prophecy. Micaiah responded by saying that Zedekiah would go into an inner chamber to hide when his false prophecy was exposed. The biblical account portrays Zedekiah as a false prophet who opposed God's true message delivered through Micaiah.
