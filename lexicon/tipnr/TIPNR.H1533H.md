Mount Gilboa is a mountain range located in northern Israel, near the ancient city of Jezreel. It is most famously known as the site where King Saul and his sons, including Jonathan, were killed in battle against the Philistines. The Philistines had gathered their forces to fight against Israel, and the two armies met on Mount Gilboa \([[1Sam.31.1|1 Samuel 31:1]]; [[1Chr.10.1|1 Chronicles 10:1]]\). In the fierce battle that ensued, the Philistines prevailed, and Saul and his sons were slain on the mountain \([[1Sam.31.8|1 Samuel 31:8]]; [[1Chr.10.8|1 Chronicles 10:8]]\). The Philistines found their bodies the following day and desecrated them, displaying them on the walls of Beth-shan. The men of Jabesh-gilead later retrieved the bodies and buried them. Mount Gilboa is also mentioned in the account of Gideon's victory over the Midianites, where some of his fearful troops were allowed to depart from the mountain \([[Judg.7.3|Judges 7:3]]\). The mountain range stands as a reminder of the tragic end of Saul's reign and the transfer of power to David, who would become Israel's next king.
