Harhas, also known as Hasrah, was the father of Shallum's wife. Shallum was the keeper of the wardrobe during the reign of King Josiah of Judah. When Hilkiah the high priest found the Book of the Law in the temple, King Josiah sent a delegation, including Shallum, to consult with the prophetess Huldah. Huldah was the wife of Shallum, making her Harhas' daughter-in-law. No other information is provided about Harhas in the Bible. \([[2Kgs.22.14|2Ki.22.14]]; [[2Chr.34.22|2Ch.34.22]]\).
