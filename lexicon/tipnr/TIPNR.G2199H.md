Wife of Zebedee The wife of Zebedee, mentioned in [[Matt.20.20|Matthew 20:20]], was the mother of James and John, two of Jesus' twelve apostles. Although her name is not given in the Bible, she played a significant role in the lives of her sons. In [[Matt.20.20|Matthew 20:20]]-21, she approached Jesus with her sons, requesting that they be granted positions of honor and authority in His kingdom. This request demonstrated her ambition for her sons but also her limited understanding of the nature of Jesus' mission at the time. Jesus responded by teaching about the importance of humility and service in His kingdom \(Matthew 20:22-28\). The wife of Zebedee was also present at the crucifixion of Jesus \(Matthew 27:56\), indicating her devotion and support for her sons' ministry.
