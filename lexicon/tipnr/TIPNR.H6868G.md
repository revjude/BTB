Zeredah is mentioned in the Bible as the hometown of Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel \([[1Kgs.11.26|1Ki.11.26]]\). Jeroboam was an Ephraimite from Zeredah who was a valiant warrior and an industrious worker. King Solomon noticed Jeroboam's abilities and made him the overseer of the forced labor of the house of Joseph. However, the prophet Ahijah prophesied that God would tear the kingdom from Solomon's son and give ten tribes to Jeroboam. When Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam, he fled to Egypt until Solomon's death. Zeredah's exact location is unknown but was likely in the hill country of Ephraim.
