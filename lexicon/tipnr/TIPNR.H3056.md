Jahdai is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.2.47|1 Chronicles 2:47]] as one of the descendants of Caleb, the son of Jephunneh. This passage is part of a larger genealogical record of the tribe of Judah, focusing particularly on the descendants of Hezron, one of the sons of Perez \(1Ch.2.3-55\). 

Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, is known for his faithfulness to the Lord during the time of the Israelites' wandering in the wilderness \(Num.14.24, Jos.14.6-14\). He was one of the twelve spies sent to explore the land of Canaan, and along with Joshua, he brought back a positive report and encouraged the people to trust in the Lord \(Num.13.30, 14.6-9\). 

In 1 Chronicles 2, several of Caleb's descendants are listed, including his sons and grandsons. Jahdai is mentioned among these descendants \([[1Chr.2.47|1Ch.2.47]]\), indicating that he was part of Caleb's lineage and a member of the tribe of Judah. 

No other specific details are provided about Jahdai's life, occupation, or role within the family or tribe. His inclusion in this genealogical record, however, serves to highlight the importance of family lineage and the preservation of ancestral records among the Israelites, particularly within the tribe of Judah.
