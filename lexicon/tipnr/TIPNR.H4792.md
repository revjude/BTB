Merom is mentioned in the context of Joshua's conquest of Canaan. A coalition of Canaanite kings, led by Jabin king of Hazor, gathered together to fight against Israel at the waters of Merom \([[Josh.11.5|Joshua 11:5]]\). Joshua and the Israelite army attacked them by surprise, defeating them and pursuing them until no survivors were left \([[Josh.11.7|Joshua 11:7]]-8\). The exact location of the waters of Merom is uncertain, but it is generally believed to be in the vicinity of Lake Huleh in northern Israel. The decisive victory at Merom was a significant milestone in the Israelite conquest of Canaan.
