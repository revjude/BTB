<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Simon</span> was the father of Judas Iscariot, the disciple who betrayed Jesus.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[John.6.71|Jhn.6.71]]; 
- only referred to as Simon **<big>[[G4613|Σίμων]]</big>**; 
-  father of Judas **<big>[[G2455|Ἰούδας]]</big>**.

Simon is mentioned in the Gospel of John as the father of Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples of Jesus \([[John.6.71|John 6:71]]; 12:4; 13:2,26\). He is not to be confused with Simon Peter or any other Simon mentioned in the New Testament. The only information provided about this Simon is his relationship to Judas Iscariot, the disciple who betrayed Jesus. The gospels do not give any further details about Simon's life, occupation, or character. His son, Judas Iscariot, is infamous for his betrayal of Jesus, which led to Jesus' arrest and crucifixion. Despite being one of the twelve chosen disciples, Judas conspired with the Jewish authorities to hand Jesus over to them for thirty pieces of silver \(Matthew 26:14-16\). Simon's role in the biblical narrative is limited to being the father of the disciple who betrayed Jesus, highlighting the tragic choice made by Judas Iscariot.
