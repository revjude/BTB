Jeshaiah is mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as one of the descendants of Benjamin who lived in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. He is listed among the leaders of the people who settled in the city. The resettlement of Jerusalem was a significant event in the history of Israel, as it marked the restoration of Jewish presence in the holy city after decades of exile. The mention of Jeshaiah in this context highlights the importance of the Benjamite tribe in the post-exilic period and their role in the reestablishment of Jewish life in Jerusalem.
