Man living before Israel's Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Jashar</span> was an ancient Hebrew book mentioned in the Old Testament, but not included in the biblical canon.
- A man living before Israel's Monarchy, first mentioned at [[Josh.10.13|Jos.10.13]]; 
- only referred to as Jashar **<big>[[H3477|יָשָׁר]]</big>**.

Jashar, also known as the "Book of Jashar" or the "Book of the Upright," is mentioned twice in the Old Testament \([[Josh.10.13|Joshua 10:13]] and [[2Sam.1.18|2 Samuel 1:18]]\). It appears to have been an ancient Hebrew collection of poetry or historical accounts that was known to the authors of the biblical texts. In [[Josh.10.13|Joshua 10:13]], the book of Jashar is referenced in connection with the miraculous event of the sun and moon standing still during Joshua's battle against the Amorite kings. In [[2Sam.1.18|2 Samuel 1:18]], David's lament over the deaths of Saul and Jonathan is said to be written in the Book of Jashar. These references suggest that the Book of Jashar was a recognized source of poetry and historical information, although the book itself is not included in the biblical canon. The exact content and date of the Book of Jashar are unknown, and no copies of the book have been discovered.
