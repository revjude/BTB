<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Bithron</span>, a ravine or region traversed by Abner and his men after a battle with Joab's forces.

- only referred to as Bithron **<big>[[H1338|בִּתְרוֹן]]</big>**.

Bithron is mentioned in [[2Sam.2.29|2 Samuel 2:29]] as a ravine or region crossed by Abner and his men after a battle with Joab's forces. Following the death of Asahel, Joab's brother, at the hands of Abner, the two armies disengaged, and Abner's men retreated. They traveled through the Bithron ravine all night before arriving at Mahanaim. The exact location of Bithron is not specified in the biblical text, but it appears to be a geographic feature that provided a route of escape for Abner's army.
