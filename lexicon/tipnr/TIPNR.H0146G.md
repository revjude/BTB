Addar is mentioned in [[Josh.15.3|Joshua 15:3]] as one of the points along the southern boundary of the territory allotted to the tribe of Judah. It is listed between the ascent of Akrabbim and Karka, indicating its location in the arid region south of the Dead Sea. The name Addar means "mighty" or "noble," but the significance of this name in relation to the place is unknown. Its exact location is uncertain, but it was likely a prominent landmark, such as a mountain or a valley, used to delineate the border. No other information about Addar is provided in the Bible. Its mention in Joshua 15 helps to define the extent of Judah's territory in the southernmost part of the Promised Land.
