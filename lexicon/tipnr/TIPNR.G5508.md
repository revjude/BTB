Chios is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Acts 20:15, as one of the stops on Paul's journey from Macedonia to Jerusalem. After leaving Troas, Paul and his companions sailed to Samothrace, then to Neapolis, and finally arrived at Chios. 

Chios is an island located in the Aegean Sea, off the coast of modern-day Turkey. It was known for its strategic location along the shipping routes between Asia Minor and Greece. The island was famous for its wine production and its cultivation of mastic, a resin used for medicinal purposes and as a spice. 

In Paul's time, Chios was part of the Roman Empire and had a significant Jewish population. The brief mention of Chios in the book of Acts suggests that it was a regular stop for ships navigating the Aegean Sea and that Paul's journey followed the established maritime trade routes of the time. 

Although the Bible does not provide any further details about Paul's activities or experiences on Chios, the island's inclusion in the account of his journey highlights the geographical scope of his travels and the spread of the early Christian church throughout the Mediterranean world.
