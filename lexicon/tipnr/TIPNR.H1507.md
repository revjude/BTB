Gezer, also referred to as Gob, was a significant Canaanite city located in the region allotted to the tribe of Ephraim. It was originally ruled by a Canaanite king, Horam, who came to the aid of Lachish but was defeated by Joshua \([[Josh.10.33|Joshua 10:33]]; 12:12\). Although the city was assigned to the Levites \([[Josh.21.21|Joshua 21:21]]; [[1Chr.6.67|1 Chronicles 6:67]]\), the Ephraimites failed to drive out the Canaanites, who continued to live there \([[Josh.16.10|Joshua 16:10]]; Judges 1:29\). During the reign of David, the Israelites fought battles against the Philistines at Gob \(Gezer\), where David's warriors defeated the giants \([[2Sam.21.18|2 Samuel 21:18]]-19; [[1Chr.20.4|1 Chronicles 20:4]]\). David also defeated the Philistines from Geba to Gezer \([[2Sam.5.25|2 Samuel 5:25]]; [[1Chr.14.16|1 Chronicles 14:16]]\). Later, King Solomon fortified Gezer, along with other key cities, using the labor of the Canaanites \([[1Kgs.9.15|1 Kings 9:15]]-17\). Gezer is mentioned as part of the inheritance of the descendants of Ephraim \([[1Chr.7.28|1 Chronicles 7:28]]\). The city's strategic location and its history of Canaanite occupation make it a significant site in the narratives of the conquest and establishment of Israel in the Promised Land.
