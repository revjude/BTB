Abinadab was a man from Kiriath-jearim in whose house the ark of God was kept for twenty years after it was returned by the Philistines \([[1Sam.7.1|1 Samuel 7:1]]\). The ark had been captured by the Philistines in battle, but after God afflicted them with plagues, they sent it back to Israel \(1 Samuel 5-6\). The men of Beth-shemesh, where the ark first arrived, were struck down by God for looking into the ark, so they sent messengers to Kiriath-jearim to take the ark away \(1 Samuel 6:19-21\). 

The ark remained in Abinadab's house until King David decided to bring it to Jerusalem. David and the Israelites went to Abinadab's house to retrieve the ark, placing it on a new cart driven by Abinadab's sons, Uzzah and Ahio \(2 Samuel 6:3; [[1Chr.13.7|1 Chronicles 13:7]]\). However, when the oxen stumbled and Uzzah reached out to steady the ark, God struck him down for his irreverence \(2 Samuel 6:6-7\). After this incident, David left the ark in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months before successfully bringing it to Jerusalem \(2 Samuel 6:10-12\).
