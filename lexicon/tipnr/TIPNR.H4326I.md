Mijamin, also known as Miniamin, is mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as a priest who played a significant role during the post-exilic period. He is first listed among the priests who sealed the covenant with Nehemiah, pledging to follow the Law of God and to keep themselves separate from the neighboring peoples \([[Neh.10.7|Neh.10.7]]\). This covenant was a solemn commitment to obey God's commands and maintain the spiritual purity of the nation. Later, Mijamin is mentioned as one of the priests who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel \([[Neh.12.5|Neh.12.5]]\). He is also listed as the head of a priestly family during the high priesthood of Joiakim \([[Neh.12.17|Neh.12.17]]\). These mentions suggest that Mijamin held a leadership position among the priests and was actively involved in the spiritual reformation of the community.
