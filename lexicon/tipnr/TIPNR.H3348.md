Jakeh is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Proverbs 30:1, as the father of Agur, the author of the sayings in this chapter. The text provides no further information about Jakeh's life, occupation, or place of origin. His name suggests that he may have been a non-Israelite, possibly from a neighboring region. The inclusion of Agur's sayings in the book of Proverbs indicates that Jakeh's son was recognized for his wisdom and that his teachings were deemed valuable enough to be included in the biblical canon.
