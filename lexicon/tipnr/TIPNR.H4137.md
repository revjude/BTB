Moladah was a town located in the Negev region of southern Israel. It was initially allotted to the tribe of Judah \(Josh 15:26\) and later to the tribe of Simeon \(Josh 19:2; 1 Chr 4:28\). After the Babylonian exile, the town was inhabited by the people of Judah \([[Neh.11.26|Neh.11.26]]\). Moladah is mentioned in the lists of towns in the Negev, along with other settlements such as Beersheba, Hormah, and Ziklag. Its exact location is uncertain, but it is believed to be in the vicinity of modern-day Khirbet el-Waten, approximately 15 miles southeast of Beersheba. The name "Moladah" may be derived from the Hebrew word meaning "birth" or "kindred."
