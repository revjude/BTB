Abel-meholah was a town in Israel, located in the Jordan Valley, south of Beth-shean. It is first mentioned in [[Judg.7.22|Judges 7:22]], where it is described as one of the places to which the Midianites fled after being defeated by Gideon. Later, in [[1Kgs.4.12|1 Kings 4:12]], Abel-meholah is listed as part of the district overseen by Baana son of Ahilud, one of Solomon's twelve district governors. The town is most notable as the birthplace of the prophet Elisha, as mentioned in [[1Kgs.19.16|1 Kings 19:16]], where God commands Elijah to anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel-meholah as his successor.
