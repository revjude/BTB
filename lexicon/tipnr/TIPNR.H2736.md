Harhaiah is mentioned in [[Neh.3.8|Nehemiah 3:8]] as a goldsmith whose son, Uzziel, was involved in repairing a section of Jerusalem's wall during the time of Nehemiah. After the Babylonian exile, Nehemiah, a Jewish official serving in the Persian court, received permission from King Artaxerxes to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the city's walls. Nehemiah organized the people of Jerusalem to work on different sections of the wall, with various individuals and families taking responsibility for specific portions. Uzziel, the son of Harhaiah, is recorded as one of the goldsmiths who made repairs next to the section repaired by the men of Jericho. The mention of Harhaiah's profession as a goldsmith suggests that he was a skilled craftsman, and his son's involvement in the wall repair project indicates the participation of people from various trades and backgrounds in this important task. The rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls was crucial for the security and restoration of the Jewish community in the post-exilic period, and the collective effort demonstrated the unity and determination of the people to restore their city and their faith.
