Illyricum was a region located along the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea, corresponding to modern-day Albania, Montenegro, and parts of Croatia and Serbia. In [[Rom.15.19|Romans 15:19]], the apostle Paul mentions that he has fully preached the gospel from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum. This suggests that Paul had traveled and preached in the region during his missionary journeys, although no specific details of his ministry there are provided in the Bible. Illyricum was known as a Roman province, and Paul's mention of it highlights the extent of his gospel outreach in the early years of Christianity.
