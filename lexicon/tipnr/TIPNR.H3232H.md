Imnah is mentioned in [[2Chr.31.14|2 Chronicles 31:14]] as a Levite who served during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. He was appointed as an overseer of the freewill offerings brought to the temple. 

During Hezekiah's reign, the king initiated significant religious reforms aimed at restoring proper worship and removing idolatry from the land. As part of these reforms, Hezekiah organized the priests and Levites and assigned them specific duties in the temple service. 

Imnah, along with other Levites, was entrusted with the responsibility of receiving and distributing the freewill offerings that the people brought to the temple. These offerings included grain, new wine, oil, honey, and other produce, as well as dedicated things and tithes. 

The Levites were responsible for ensuring that these offerings were properly stored and distributed among the priests and their families according to their divisions. This system of organization and distribution was essential for the maintenance of the temple and the support of the priestly families. 

Imnah's specific role as an overseer of the freewill offerings highlights the importance of the Levites in the administration and functioning of the temple. It also underscores the significance of the people's willingness to contribute to the temple service and support the religious life of the community. 

Apart from this brief mention in 2 Chronicles 31, no other details are provided about Imnah's life or his other responsibilities as a Levite. However, his inclusion in the narrative of Hezekiah's reforms indicates that he was a trusted and reliable figure who played a significant role in the restoration of proper worship in Judah.
