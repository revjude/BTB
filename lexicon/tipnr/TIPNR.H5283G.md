-  son of Benjamin<[[H1144G]]>; 
- a brother of Bela<[[H1106A]]>, Becher<[[H1071G]]>, Ashbel<[[H0788]]>, Gera<[[H1617G]]>, Ahiram<[[H0297]]>, Rosh<[[H7220]]>, Muppim<[[H4649]]>, Huppim<[[H2650H]]>, Ard<[[H0714G]]>, Ahiram<[[H0297]]> and Jediael<[[H3043G]]>.

Naaman, also referred to as Nohah, appears in the genealogies of the tribe of Benjamin in [[Gen.46.21|Genesis 46:21]] and [[1Chr.8.2|1 Chronicles 8:2]]. He is listed among the sons of Benjamin who went down to Egypt with Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and his family. 

The mention of Naaman in these genealogies serves to establish his place within the family line of Benjamin and his role as one of the ancestors of the Benjamite tribe. The genealogies in Genesis and 1 Chronicles provide a record of the descendants of Jacob, who became the twelve tribes of Israel. 

The variation in the name between Naaman and Nohah may be due to differences in pronunciation or transcription over time. Despite this difference, both references clearly identify him as a son of Benjamin. 

Apart from being listed in these genealogies, no further information is provided about Naaman's life, character, or specific role within the tribe. His significance lies primarily in his place within the family line of Benjamin and his contribution to the growth and development of the tribe in its early stages.
