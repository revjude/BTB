Mary's brother living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Lazarus</span>, the brother of Mary and Martha, was raised from the dead by Jesus \(Jn.11.1-44; 12.1-2,9-11\).
- Mary's brother living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[John.11.1|Jhn.11.1]]; 
- only referred to as Lazarus **<big>[[G2976|Λάζαρος]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Martha **<big>[[G3136|Μάρθα]]</big>** and Mary **<big>[[G3137|Μαρία]]</big>**.

Lazarus was the brother of Mary and Martha, who lived in the village of Bethany \(Jn.11.1\). Jesus loved Lazarus and his sisters \(Jn.11.5\). When Lazarus fell ill, his sisters sent word to Jesus, but by the time Jesus arrived, Lazarus had been dead for four days \(Jn.11.6,17\). Jesus went to the tomb and called for Lazarus to come out, and Lazarus emerged, still wrapped in burial cloths \(Jn.11.43-44\). This miraculous sign led many to believe in Jesus \(Jn.11.45\). Later, Jesus visited Lazarus' home, where Martha served a meal and Mary anointed Jesus' feet with perfume \(Jn.12.1-3\). The chief priests plotted to kill Lazarus because his resurrection caused many to believe in Jesus \(Jn.12.9-11\). Lazarus' story demonstrates Jesus' power over death and foreshadows His own resurrection.
