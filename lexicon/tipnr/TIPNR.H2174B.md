Zimri is mentioned in the Bible as one of the many nations that would face God's judgment as prophesied by Jeremiah \([[Jer.25.25|Jer.25.25]]\). In this prophecy, Jeremiah declares that God would make all the nations drink the wine of His wrath, including Zimri. The exact identity and location of Zimri are uncertain, but it is listed among Arabian tribes and nations. It may refer to a region in Arabia, possibly connected with the Zimran, a son of Abraham and Keturah \(Gen.25:2\).
