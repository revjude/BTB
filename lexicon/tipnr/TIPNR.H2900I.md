Nehemiah's adversary living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Tobiah</span> was an Ammonite official who, along with Sanballat the Horonite, opposed Nehemiah's efforts to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
- Nehemiah's adversary of the Ammonites living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Neh.2.10|Neh.2.10]]; 
- only referred to as Tobiah **<big>[[H2900|טוֹבִיָּה]]</big>**; 
- husband of daughter\_of\_Shecaniah **<big>[[H7935|שְׁכַנְיָה]]</big>**; 
-  father of Jehohanan **<big>[[H3076|יְהוֹחָנָן]]</big>**.

Tobiah, described as an Ammonite official, was one of the main opponents of Nehemiah during the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem \([[Neh.2.10|Nehemiah 2:10]], 19; 4:3, 7; 6:1, 12, 14, 17, 19; 13:4, 7, 8\). Along with Sanballat the Horonite and Geshem the Arab, Tobiah mocked and threatened Nehemiah and the Jews, trying to discourage and intimidate them from completing the work. Tobiah had close ties with some of the Jewish nobles, who kept him informed about Nehemiah's activities \([[Neh.6.1|Nehemiah 6:1]]7-19\). He even had a room in the temple courts, which Nehemiah later cleared out \([[Neh.13.4|Nehemiah 13:4]]-8\). Despite the opposition and threats, Nehemiah persevered in rebuilding the walls, trusting in God's protection and strength. Tobiah's actions demonstrate the political and social challenges faced by Nehemiah in his efforts to restore Jerusalem and reform the Jewish community.
