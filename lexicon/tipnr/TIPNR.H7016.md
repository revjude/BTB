Kinah was a town located in the Negev, the southern region of Judah \([[Josh.15.22|Joshua 15:22]]\). It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the context of the list of towns allotted to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land under Joshua. No further information about the town's history or significance is provided in the biblical text. The exact location of Kinah is unknown, but it was likely situated in the arid wilderness region south of Hebron.
