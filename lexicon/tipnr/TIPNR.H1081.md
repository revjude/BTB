<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Baladan</span> was the father of Merodach-baladan, king of Babylon.
- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Kgs.20.12|2Ki.20.12]]; 
- only referred to as Baladan **<big>[[H1081|בַּלְאֲדָן]]</big>**;  
-  father of Merodach-baladan **<big>[[H1255|בְּרֹאדַךְ בַּלְאֲדָן]]</big>**.

Baladan is mentioned in [[2Kgs.20.12|2 Kings 20:12]] and [[Isa.39.1|Isaiah 39:1]] as the father of Merodach-baladan \(also known as Berodach-baladan\), who was the king of Babylon. Merodach-baladan sent letters and a present to King Hezekiah of Judah after hearing of his illness and recovery. This diplomatic gesture led to Hezekiah showing the Babylonian envoys all his treasures, which the prophet Isaiah warned would one day be carried off to Babylon. Baladan is not mentioned in any other context, and no further information is provided about his life or role in Babylonian history. He is known only as the father of the king who initiated contact with Hezekiah. Merodach-baladan is likely the Babylonian king known outside the Bible as Marduk-apla-iddina II, who ruled Babylon in the late 8th century BC.
