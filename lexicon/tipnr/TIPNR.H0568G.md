Amariah is mentioned in the genealogy of the Levitical priesthood, specifically in the lineage of Aaron's son Eleazar. He is listed as the son of Meraioth and the father of Ahitub, who was the father of Zadok, the high priest during the reigns of David and Solomon. \(1Ch.6.7,52\) 

The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 6 traces the descendants of Levi, focusing on the priestly line of Aaron. It establishes the legitimacy and continuity of the priesthood, highlighting significant figures such as Zadok, who played a crucial role in the religious life of Israel during the united monarchy. 

Amariah's position in the genealogy emphasizes the importance of the priestly lineage and the passing down of the priestly office from one generation to another. It also demonstrates God's faithfulness in maintaining the priesthood according to His covenant with Aaron and his descendants. 

Apart from being mentioned in the genealogy, no further details are provided about Amariah's life, his role as a priest, or any significant events associated with him. 

The inclusion of Amariah in the priestly genealogy serves to validate the legitimacy of Zadok's priesthood and to underscore the importance of the Aaronic lineage in the religious leadership of Israel. It also highlights the significance of genealogical records in establishing the authority and continuity of the priesthood.
