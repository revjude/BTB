Zeresh was the wife of Haman, the chief antagonist in the Book of Esther. When Haman became enraged at Mordecai's refusal to bow down to him, Zeresh and Haman's friends advised him to have a gallows built and to ask the king's permission to hang Mordecai on it. This plan reveals Zeresh's support for her husband's evil schemes and her own animosity towards the Jews. However, after Haman was humiliated by having to honor Mordecai, Zeresh and his wise men predicted Haman's downfall, stating that he could not prevail against Mordecai if he was of Jewish descent. Zeresh's words proved true, as Haman was ultimately hanged on the very gallows he had prepared for Mordecai. The story of Zeresh and Haman serves as a warning against pride, hatred, and the consequences of plotting evil against others.
