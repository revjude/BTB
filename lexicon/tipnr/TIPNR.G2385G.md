James, the son of Zebedee and brother of John, was one of the Twelve Apostles chosen by Jesus. He was a fisherman by trade and was called by Jesus, along with his brother, to follow Him \([[Matt.4.21|Matthew 4:21]]; [[Mark.1.19|Mark 1:19]]\). James, John, and Peter formed Jesus' inner circle and were present at significant events such as the Transfiguration \([[Matt.17.1|Matthew 17:1]]; [[Mark.9.2|Mark 9:2]]; [[Luke.9.28|Luke 9:28]]\) and Jesus' agony in the Garden of Gethsemane \([[Mark.14.33|Mark 14:33]]\). Jesus surnamed James and John "Boanerges," meaning "Sons of Thunder" \(Mark 3:17\), possibly referring to their zealous and passionate nature. James and his brother also asked Jesus for positions of honor in His kingdom \([[Mark.10.35|Mark 10:35]]-41\). After Jesus' ascension, James continued to play a prominent role in the early church \(Acts 1:13\). He was the first of the Twelve Apostles to be martyred, executed by Herod Agrippa I around 44 AD \(Acts 12:2\).
