- A man living at the time of United Monarchy, only mentioned at [[2Sam.23.36|2Sa.23.36]]; 
- only referred to as Igal **<big>[[H3008|יִגְאָל]]</big>**; 
- a son of Nathan **<big>[[H5416|נָתָן]]</big>**.

Igal, the son of Nathan of Zobah, is mentioned in [[2Sam.23.36|2 Samuel 23:36]] as one of King David's mighty warriors. He is included in the list of the "thirty" mighty men who were renowned for their military skills, strength, and bravery. 

The "mighty men" or "mighty warriors" were an elite group of soldiers who served under King David and played a significant role in his military campaigns and the establishment of his kingdom. They were known for their exceptional combat abilities and unwavering loyalty to the king. 

Igal is specifically identified as the son of Nathan of Zobah. Zobah was an Aramean kingdom located northeast of Israel, in the region of modern-day Syria. The mention of Igal's father and his place of origin suggests that he may have been a foreign warrior who had joined David's army, possibly as a result of David's military victories and the expansion of his kingdom. 

The list of David's mighty warriors in 2 Samuel 23 highlights the diversity of David's army, which included men from various tribes of Israel as well as foreign allies. This reflects David's ability to unite and lead a strong and loyal military force. 

Apart from his inclusion in the list of mighty warriors, no other specific details are provided about Igal's life or his individual military exploits. However, his presence among the "thirty" indicates that he was a highly skilled and respected warrior who contributed significantly to David's military successes and the security of his kingdom.
