Man living at the time before the Flood

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Adam</span>, the first man created by God, sinned and brought death into the world, but through Christ, the last Adam, came life and resurrection \([[Gen.2.20|Gen.2.20]]-5.5; Rom.5.14; [[1Cor.15.22|1Co.15.22]],45\).
- A man living at the time before the Flood, first mentioned at [[Gen.2.19|Gen.2.19]]; 
- referred to as Adam<[[H0121G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ם</span>\), or Adam or "man" or "mankind" or "others" \(KJV= Adam\) <[[H0120H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ם</span>\), or Adam<[[G0076]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ἀδάμ</span>\); 
-  husband of Eve<[[H2332]]>; 
-  father of Cain<[[H7014B]]>, Abel<[[H1893]]> and Seth<[[H8352]]>.

Adam was the first man, created by God on the sixth day of creation \(Genesis 1:26-27\). He was formed from the dust of the ground, and God breathed life into him, making him a living being \(Genesis 2:7\). God placed Adam in the Garden of Eden to tend and keep it, and He created Eve, the first woman, from Adam's rib as a companion for him \(Genesis 2:15-25\). 

God allowed Adam to eat from any tree in the garden except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, warning that eating from this tree would lead to death \(Genesis 2:16-17\). However, Adam and Eve were tempted by the serpent and disobeyed God, eating the forbidden fruit \(Genesis 3:1-6\). As a consequence, they were expelled from the Garden of Eden and subjected to death, pain, and hardship \(Genesis 3:16-24\). 

After the fall, Adam and Eve had several children, including Cain, Abel, and Seth \([[Gen.4.1|Genesis 4:1]]-2, 25\). Adam lived for 930 years and died \([[Gen.5.5|Genesis 5:5]]\), but his legacy as the first man and the progenitor of the human race continued throughout the Bible. 

In the New Testament, Adam is contrasted with Christ, who is referred to as the "last Adam" \(1 Corinthians 15:45\). While Adam's disobedience brought sin and death into the world, Christ's obedience and sacrifice brought righteousness and life \(Romans 5:12-21\). The apostle Paul teaches that all people die because of their connection to Adam, but those who are in Christ will be made alive at the resurrection \([[1Cor.15.22|1 Corinthians 15:22]]\). 

Adam's creation, fall, and redemption through Christ are central themes in the biblical narrative, highlighting God's plan to restore humanity's relationship with Him and the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ.
