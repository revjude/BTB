Three Taverns \(Latin: Tres Tabernae\) was a staging post located on the Appian Way, approximately 33 miles \(53 km\) south of Rome. It was situated near the junction of the Appian Way and a side road leading to Antium \(modern-day Anzio\). The name "Three Taverns" suggests that it served as a rest stop and a place of lodging for travelers. When the apostle Paul was being escorted to Rome as a prisoner, some Christians from Rome journeyed to meet him at Three Taverns and the Forum of Appius \(Acts 28:15\). This gesture of support and fellowship likely encouraged Paul as he faced an uncertain future in the imperial capital. The fact that the Roman Christians were willing to travel a considerable distance to meet Paul testifies to his reputation and the esteem in which he was held by the early church.
