- A prophet living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Num.22.5|Num.22.5]]; 
- referred to as Balaam **<big>[[H1109|בִּלְעָם]]</big>**, or Balaam **<big>[[G0903|Βαλαάμ]]</big>**;

Balaam was a pagan prophet from Pethor near the Euphrates River \([[Num.22.5|Numbers 22:5]]\). Balak, king of Moab, hired him to curse the Israelites as they approached Moabite territory \(Numbers 22:6\). Despite initial resistance, Balaam agreed to go with Balak's messengers after God permitted him, but only to speak what God told him \([[Num.22.7|Numbers 22:7]]-21\). On the way, Balaam's donkey saw the Angel of the Lord and saved Balaam from being killed \(Numbers 22:22-35\). In three oracles, Balaam blessed Israel instead of cursing them \(Numbers 23-24\). Later, Balaam was killed in Israel's battle against Midian \([[Num.31.8|Numbers 31:8]]\). He had advised the Midianites to entice Israel into idolatry and immorality \([[Num.31.16|Numbers 31:16]]; [[Rev.2.14|Revelation 2:14]]\). Balaam's story is remembered as an example of God's sovereignty \(Deuteronomy 23:4-5; [[Josh.24.9|Joshua 24:9]]-10; [[Neh.13.2|Nehemiah 13:2]]; [[Mic.6.5|Micah 6:5]]\) and as a warning against greed and false teaching \([[2Pet.2.15|2 Peter 2:15]]; [[Jude.1.11|Jude 1:11]]\).
