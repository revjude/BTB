Anah was a Horite, a descendant of Seir, who lived in the land of Edom. He was the father of Oholibamah, one of Esau's wives. Anah is mentioned in the genealogies of Esau and Seir, both in Genesis and 1 Chronicles. 

One notable event associated with Anah is his discovery of hot springs in the wilderness while he was grazing his father's donkeys. This discovery suggests that Anah was an observant and resourceful individual. 

Anah is also referred to as a Hivite in one passage, which may indicate that the Horites and Hivites were related or that Anah had a connection to both groups. As the father-in-law of Esau, Anah played a role in the intermarriage between the Edomites and the Horites, which had significant implications for the history of the region.
