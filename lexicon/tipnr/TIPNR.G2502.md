Josiah was a king of Judah who reigned from approximately 640 to 609 BC. He was the son of Amon and the grandson of Manasseh \([[2Kgs.21.24|2 Kings 21:24]], 26; [[1Chr.3.14|1 Chronicles 3:14]]\). Josiah became king at the age of eight and reigned for thirty-one years in Jerusalem \([[2Kgs.22.1|2 Kings 22:1]]; [[2Chr.34.1|2 Chronicles 34:1]]\). 

Josiah is best known for his religious reforms and his commitment to following the Law of the Lord. In the eighteenth year of his reign, Josiah initiated repairs to the temple \([[2Kgs.22.3|2 Kings 22:3]]-7; 2 Chronicles 34:8-13\). During these repairs, the Book of the Law was discovered \(2 Kings 22:8-13; [[2Chr.34.1|2 Chronicles 34:1]]4-21\). Upon hearing the words of the Law, Josiah tore his clothes in repentance and sought the guidance of the prophetess Huldah \([[2Kgs.22.1|2 Kings 22:1]]1-20; 2 Chronicles 34:22-28\). 

Josiah then led a comprehensive religious reform, removing pagan worship sites, idols, and practices from Judah and Jerusalem \(2 Kings 23:1-25; 2 Chronicles 34:29-35:19\). He renewed the covenant between the people and God and celebrated the Passover with great dedication \(2 Kings 23:21-23; [[2Chr.35.1|2 Chronicles 35:1]]-19\). 

Josiah's reign and reforms were praised by the prophets, including Jeremiah and Zephaniah \([[Jer.1.2|Jeremiah 1:2]]; 3:6; 22:11, 18; 25:1, 3; 26:1; 35:1; 36:1-2, 9; [[Zeph.1.1|Zephaniah 1:1]]\). However, Josiah's life came to a tragic end when he confronted Pharaoh Necho of Egypt at Megiddo and was killed in battle \([[2Kgs.23.29|2 Kings 23:29]]-30; 2 Chronicles 35:20-27\). He was succeeded by his son Jehoahaz \([[2Kgs.23.30|2 Kings 23:30]]; [[2Chr.36.1|2 Chronicles 36:1]]\). 

Despite the reforms Josiah implemented, Judah's unfaithfulness persisted, and the nation ultimately faced the Babylonian exile \(2 Kings 23:26-27; [[Jer.25.1|Jeremiah 25:1]]-14\). Nonetheless, Josiah is remembered as a righteous king who sought to turn the nation back to God.
