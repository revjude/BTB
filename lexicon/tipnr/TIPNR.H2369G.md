<small>*Male • Son of Heber • A descendant of Asher.*</small>

Man living before Israel's Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Hotham</span>, also known as Helem, was a descendant of Asher mentioned in the genealogy of the tribe of Asher.
- A man from the tribe of Asher living before Israel's Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Chr.7.32|1Ch.7.32]]; 
- referred to as Hotham **<big>[[H2369|חוֹתָם]]</big>**, or Helem **<big>[[H1987|הֶלֶם]]</big>**; 
-  son of Heber **<big>[[H2268|חֶבֶר]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Japhlet **<big>[[H3310|יַפְלֵט]]</big>**, Shomer **<big>[[H7763|שׁוֹמֵר]]</big>** and Shua **<big>[[H7774|שׁוּעָא]]</big>**; 
-  father of Zophah **<big>[[H6690|צוֹפַח]]</big>**, Imna **<big>[[H3234|יִמְנָע]]</big>**, Shelesh **<big>[[H8028|שֶׁלֶשׁ]]</big>** and Amal **<big>[[H6000|עָמָל]]</big>**.

Hotham, also referred to as Helem, is mentioned in [[1Chr.7.32|1 Chronicles 7:32]] and 7:35 as part of the genealogy of the tribe of Asher. In verse 32, Hotham is listed as one of the sons of Heber, along with Shomer, Shual, Beri, and Imrah. Heber was a descendant of Beriah, one of the sons of Asher. 

In verse 35, Hotham is mentioned again, this time as the brother of Shemer \(possibly the same person as Shomer in verse 32\) and the son of Helem. This suggests that Hotham and Helem may be different names for the same individual, or that there is a discrepancy in the genealogical record. 

The tribe of Asher was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Asher, the eighth son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\). The genealogies in 1 Chronicles 7 provide a detailed record of the descendants of Asher, highlighting the importance of family lineage and tribal identity in ancient Israel. 

Apart from being mentioned in these genealogical lists, no further information is provided about Hotham or Helem in the Bible. Their inclusion in the genealogy of Asher serves to establish their place within the tribal lineage and to demonstrate the continuity of the family line from one generation to the next.
