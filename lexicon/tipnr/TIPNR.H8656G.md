Tirzah was one of the five daughters of Zelophehad, a descendant of Manasseh \([[Num.26.33|Numbers 26:33]]; 27:1; 36:11; [[Josh.17.3|Joshua 17:3]]\). Zelophehad had no sons, and his daughters \(Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah\) approached Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of Israel to seek the right to inherit their father's property. Moses brought their case before the Lord, who instructed him to grant the daughters the right to inherit their father's property in the absence of male heirs \([[Num.27.1|Numbers 27:1]]-11\). This ruling set a precedent for inheritance rights in Israel. Later, when the Israelites were preparing to enter the Promised Land, the heads of the clan of Manasseh raised concerns about the potential loss of tribal land if the daughters were to marry outside their tribe. In response, the Lord commanded that the daughters of Zelophehad must marry within their father's tribal clan to keep the inheritance within the tribe \(Numbers 36:1-12\). Tirzah and her sisters complied with this ruling \([[Num.36.11|Numbers 36:11]]\). The story of Tirzah and her sisters highlights the importance of inheritance rights and the preservation of tribal allotments in ancient Israel.
