Abel-keramim is mentioned in [[Judg.11.33|Judges 11:33]] as one of the places Jephthah attacked during his battles against the Ammonites. After Jephthah was appointed as the leader of the Israelites in Gilead, he made a vow to the Lord and led his army against the Ammonites. He defeated them from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith, including twenty cities, as far as Abel-keramim. The exact location of Abel-keramim is unknown, but it was likely a town near Ammonite territory, east of the Jordan River.
