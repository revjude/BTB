Tiras is mentioned in [[Gen.10.2|Genesis 10:2]] and [[1Chr.1.5|1 Chronicles 1:5]] as one of the sons of Japheth, along with Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, and Meshech. Japheth was one of the three sons of Noah, and his descendants are listed in the Table of Nations \(Genesis 10\), which traces the spread of the nations after the flood. The descendants of Japheth are generally associated with the peoples of Europe and Asia Minor. No specific details are provided about Tiras or his descendants, but some ancient historians and Jewish traditions have attempted to identify them with various ethnic groups, such as the Thracians or the Etruscans. However, these identifications remain speculative and cannot be confirmed from the biblical text alone.
