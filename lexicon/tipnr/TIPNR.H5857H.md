In [[Jer.49.3|Jeremiah 49:3]], Ai is mentioned as a city of the Ammonites, a people group living east of the Jordan River. This Ai is distinct from the Canaanite city of the same name. The prophet Jeremiah foretells the destruction of Ai and other Ammonite cities as part of a divine judgment against the Ammonites for their pride and hostility towards Israel \(Jeremiah 49:1-6\). 

The prophecy states that Ai will be destroyed, and its people will flee in terror. The Ammonites are called to lament and run to and fro, for their god Milcom will go into exile along with his priests and officials. This prophecy was likely fulfilled during the Babylonian conquest of the region under Nebuchadnezzar II in the early 6th century BC. The exact location of this Ammonite city of Ai is unknown.
