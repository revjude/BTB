Ashpenaz was a high-ranking official in the court of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. He held the position of chief of the eunuchs, which placed him in charge of the king's household servants. After Nebuchadnezzar's conquest of Jerusalem, Ashpenaz was tasked with selecting young Israelite men of noble and royal birth to be trained in the language and literature of the Babylonians. Among those chosen were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, who were given Babylonian names. Ashpenaz was responsible for overseeing their education and ensuring their well-being during their time in the king's service.
