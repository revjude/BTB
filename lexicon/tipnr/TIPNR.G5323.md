Phanuel is mentioned in the Bible as the father of Anna, a prophetess who witnessed the infant Jesus at the temple in Jerusalem \([[Luke.2.36|Luke 2:36]]\). Anna was from the tribe of Asher and was advanced in years, having lived with her husband for seven years before becoming a widow. She devoted herself to worship, fasting, and prayer in the temple. When Mary and Joseph brought the infant Jesus to the temple for the purification rites, Anna recognized him as the Messiah and spoke about him to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem \(Luke 2:37-38\). Phanuel's name means "face of God," which may suggest that he was a devout man. However, no other details are provided about his life or role in Anna's upbringing.
