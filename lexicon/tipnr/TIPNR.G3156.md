Matthew, also known as Levi, was a tax collector in Capernaum before being called by Jesus to become one of His twelve apostles. As a tax collector, Matthew would have been considered a sinner and an outcast by the Jewish community. However, Jesus saw beyond his profession and called him to follow Him \([[Matt.9.9|Matthew 9:9]]; [[Mark.2.14|Mark 2:14]]; [[Luke.5.27|Luke 5:27]]\). Matthew responded immediately, leaving his tax booth and hosting a great feast for Jesus in his home, inviting other tax collectors and sinners \([[Luke.5.29|Luke 5:29]]\). As an apostle, Matthew witnessed Jesus' ministry, death, and resurrection. He is also traditionally attributed as the author of the Gospel of Matthew, which emphasizes Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and the long-awaited Messiah \([[Matt.10.3|Matthew 10:3]]; [[Mark.3.18|Mark 3:18]]; [[Luke.6.15|Luke 6:15]]; Acts 1:13\).
