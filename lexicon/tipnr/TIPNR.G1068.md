Gethsemane is the name of a garden located at the foot of the Mount of Olives, just outside Jerusalem. It is mentioned in the New Testament Gospels as the place where Jesus went to pray and was later arrested before his crucifixion. 

The name "Gethsemane" is derived from the Aramaic words "gat shemanim," meaning "oil press," suggesting that the garden may have contained an olive press or was located in an area known for olive oil production. 

According to [[Matt.26.36|Matthew 26:36]] and [[Mark.14.32|Mark 14:32]], after the Last Supper, Jesus went with his disciples to Gethsemane. He took Peter, James, and John with him and asked them to stay awake and pray while he went further into the garden to pray alone. In his agony, Jesus prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as you will" \(Matthew 26:39\). 

During his prayer, Jesus was deeply distressed and sorrowful, to the point of sweating drops of blood \(Luke 22:44\). This intense emotional and spiritual struggle underscores the significance of Gethsemane as the place where Jesus fully embraced his impending suffering and death. After his prayer, Jesus was betrayed by Judas Iscariot and arrested.
