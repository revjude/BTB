Ben-hadad I was the king of Aram \(Syria\) during the reigns of Asa, king of Judah, and Baasha, king of Israel. He is first mentioned in [[1Kgs.15.18|1 Kings 15:18]]-20 and [[2Chr.16.2|2 Chronicles 16:2]]-4, where Asa sends him a gift of silver and gold from the temple treasuries to persuade him to break his treaty with Baasha and attack Israel. Ben-hadad agrees and conquers several cities in northern Israel, forcing Baasha to abandon his fortification project at Ramah. Later, in 1 Kings 20, Ben-hadad leads a coalition of thirty-two kings against Ahab, king of Israel. Despite his initial confidence, Ben-hadad is defeated twice by Ahab, who is guided by prophetic advice. After his second defeat, Ben-hadad humbles himself before Ahab, who spares his life and makes a treaty with him. The prophet condemns Ahab for this decision, as Ben-hadad was to be destroyed. [[Jer.49.27|Jeremiah 49:27]] mentions the "wall of Damascus," likely referring to Ben-hadad's capital city, in a prophecy of judgment against Aram. Ben-hadad I's reign was marked by his military campaigns against Israel and his diplomatic interactions with Judah, shaping the political landscape of the region.
