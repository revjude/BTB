Ahimaaz is mentioned briefly in the context of King Solomon's administration. He was one of Solomon's twelve district governors, responsible for providing resources for the king's household. Ahimaaz was assigned to the region of Naphtali, located in the northern part of Israel. \(1Ki.4.7,15\) 

Notably, Ahimaaz was married to Basemath, one of Solomon's daughters. This marriage alliance suggests that Ahimaaz was a trusted official and had a close relationship with the royal family. The practice of marrying daughters to high-ranking officials was common in ancient times to strengthen political alliances and ensure loyalty.
