The Valley of Sorek was the place where Delilah, the woman who betrayed Samson, lived \(Judg. 16:4\). It was here that Samson fell in love with Delilah, who was eventually bribed by the Philistines to discover the secret of Samson's great strength. After three failed attempts, Delilah finally learned that Samson's strength was connected to his uncut hair, a symbol of his Nazirite vow \(Judg. 16:15-17\). She cut his hair while he slept, enabling the Philistines to capture him \(Judg. 16:18-21\). The exact location of the Sorek Valley is uncertain, but it was likely situated somewhere in the territory of Judah, near Philistine territory.
