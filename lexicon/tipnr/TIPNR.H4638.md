Maarath appears in the Bible only once as one of the towns in the hill country of Judah \([[Josh.15.59|Joshua 15:59]]\). It is listed among the cities allocated to the tribe of Judah during the distribution of the Promised Land. The town appears in a group of settlements that were located in the central hill country region of Judah's territory. 

 The exact location of Maarath remains uncertain, but its listing among other hill country towns suggests it was situated in the mountainous region between Jerusalem and Hebron. No archaeological site has been definitively identified as ancient Maarath.
