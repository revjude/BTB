Azarel is mentioned in Ezra 10 as one of the men who had married foreign women during the time of Ezra. After the return from Babylonian captivity, Ezra discovered that many Israelites, including priests and Levites, had intermarried with the neighboring peoples, going against God's commands. Ezra called for an assembly and urged the people to confess their sin and separate themselves from their foreign wives. Azarel is listed among those who had taken foreign wives and pledged to put them away. This event demonstrates the importance of maintaining the purity and identity of the Israelite community, as well as the need for repentance and obedience to God's laws.
