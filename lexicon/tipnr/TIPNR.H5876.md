En-haddah is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Josh.19.21|Joshua 19:21]], as one of the cities allotted to the tribe of Issachar during the division of the Promised Land. It is listed among other cities in Issachar's territory, such as Remeth, En-gannim, and Beth-pazzez. 

The name En-haddah means "spring of Haddah" or "swift fountain," suggesting the presence of a water source in the area. No other details about this city are provided in the Bible, and its exact location is unknown. It was likely situated within the boundaries of Issachar's territory, which was located in the northern part of Israel, in the region of the Jezreel Valley.
