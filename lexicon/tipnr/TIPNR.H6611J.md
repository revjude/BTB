Pethahiah was a Levite who was appointed to represent the people in matters related to the Persian king during the time of Nehemiah, according to [[Neh.11.24|Nehemiah 11:24]]. After the completion of the wall and the repopulation of Jerusalem, various officials and leaders were appointed to oversee the city's affairs. Pethahiah's role as a representative before the king suggests that he was a trusted and capable leader who could communicate the needs and concerns of the Jewish community to the Persian authorities. This appointment also reflects the ongoing relationship between the Jewish community and the Persian Empire during the post-exilic period.
