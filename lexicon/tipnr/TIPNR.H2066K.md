- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.33|Ezr.10.33]]; 
- only referred to as Zabad<[[H2066K]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ז</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>\).

Zabad, the son of Hashum, is listed among the men who had taken foreign wives during the Babylonian exile. This issue came to light when Ezra, the priest and scribe, returned to Jerusalem and discovered that many Israelites had intermarried with the pagan peoples of the land, contrary to God's command. Zabad was one of those who had married a foreign woman. When Ezra called for repentance, Zabad and the others agreed to separate from their foreign wives and children to preserve the holiness of the Jewish people.
