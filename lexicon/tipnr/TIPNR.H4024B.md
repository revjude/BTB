Migdol is mentioned in the Bible as a place near the Red Sea where the Israelites camped during their Exodus from Egypt \([[Exod.14.2|Exodus 14:2]]; [[Num.33.7|Numbers 33:7]]\). The name Migdol is derived from the Hebrew word "migdal," meaning "tower" or "fortress." It is believed to be a reference to a fortified border city in ancient Egypt. 

In the prophetic books, Migdol is mentioned as one of the cities in Egypt where Jewish refugees settled after the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem \([[Jer.44.1|Jeremiah 44:1]]\). The prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel also include Migdol in their prophecies against Egypt, indicating that it was a significant city \([[Jer.46.14|Jeremiah 46:14]]; [[Ezek.29.10|Ezekiel 29:10]]; 30:6\). 

The exact location of the biblical Migdol is uncertain, but it is thought to be in the eastern Nile Delta region, possibly near the present-day Suez Canal. Some scholars have proposed that it might be identified with the ancient Egyptian city of "Tjeku" or "Tjel," known in Greek as "Sile," which served as a frontier fortress on the eastern border of Egypt.
