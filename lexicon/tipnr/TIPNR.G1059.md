- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Neh.11.17|Act.5.34]]; 
- only referred to as Gamaliel<[[G1059]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Γαμαλιήλ</span>\).

Gamaliel was a prominent Pharisee and highly respected teacher of the law during the early days of the Christian church. He is mentioned twice in the book of Acts. In Acts 5:34-40, Gamaliel appears as a member of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council. When the apostles were brought before the council and some members wanted to put them to death, Gamaliel advised caution. He argued that if the apostles' teaching was of human origin, it would fail on its own, but if it was from God, the council would be fighting against God. The Sanhedrin followed Gamaliel's advice and released the apostles after beating them and ordering them not to speak in Jesus' name. In Acts 22:3, Paul identifies himself as a student of Gamaliel, having been educated under him in strict adherence to the law. This suggests that Gamaliel was a highly influential teacher whose students went on to hold significant positions in Jewish society. Gamaliel's wisdom and moderation in dealing with the early Christians may have influenced Paul's later approach to engaging with different groups in his missionary work.
