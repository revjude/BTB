Ithmah the Moabite is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.11.46|1 Chronicles 11:46]] as one of the mighty warriors who joined David's army. He is listed among the warriors from various tribes and nations who supported David during his reign as king of Israel. 

Ithmah's inclusion in this list is notable because he is identified as a Moabite. The Moabites were a neighboring nation to Israel, often in conflict with the Israelites. However, Ithmah's presence in David's army suggests that he had aligned himself with Israel and was a loyal supporter of King David. 

No other details are provided about Ithmah's background, family, or specific military exploits. His mention in this passage highlights the diverse group of skilled warriors who were attracted to David's leadership and played a role in establishing and defending his kingdom.
