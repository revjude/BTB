Zabdi, also known as Zimri, was a descendant of Judah and an ancestor of Achan. Achan, from the tribe of Judah, violated God's command by taking forbidden plunder from Jericho during Israel's conquest of the city. As a result, Israel suffered a defeat at Ai. When Achan's sin was discovered through a process of elimination, he and his family were stoned and burned. Zabdi is mentioned in Achan's genealogy, highlighting the connection between an individual's sin and its impact on the entire community.
