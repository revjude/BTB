Hobab was a Midianite and the son of Reuel \(also known as Jethro\), who was Moses' father-in-law \([[Num.10.29|Numbers 10:29]]\). He is mentioned in two passages in the Bible, [[Num.10.29|Numbers 10:29]] and [[Judg.4.11|Judges 4:11]]. 

In [[Num.10.29|Numbers 10:29]], as the Israelites were preparing to depart from Mount Sinai, Moses invited Hobab to join them on their journey to the Promised Land. Moses said, "We are setting out for the place of which the Lord said, 'I will give it to you.' Come with us, and we will treat you well, for the Lord has promised good to Israel." Initially, Hobab declined the invitation, preferring to return to his own land and people. However, it is implied that he eventually agreed to accompany the Israelites, as his descendants, the Kenites, are later mentioned as living among the Israelites \([[Judg.4.11|Judges 4:11]]\). 

In [[Judg.4.11|Judges 4:11]], Hobab is described as the father-in-law of Heber the Kenite. This passage suggests that Hobab's descendants maintained a close relationship with the Israelites, even though they were not part of the original twelve tribes. 

As a Midianite, Hobab would have had valuable knowledge of the wilderness through which the Israelites were traveling. His presence and guidance would have been beneficial to the Israelites during their journey to the Promised Land.
