- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.23|Ezr.10.23]]; 
- only referred to as Jozabad<[[H3107O]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יו</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ז</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>\).

Jozabad is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.23|Ezra 10:23]] as one of the Levites who had married foreign women during the post-exilic period. The context of the passage is Ezra's reforms and the issue of intermarriage between the Israelites and the pagan peoples of the land \(Ezra 9-10\). 

Upon learning of the widespread intermarriage, Ezra led the people in confession and repentance \(Ezra 9:1-10:4\). The Israelites made a covenant to put away their foreign wives and children \(Ezra 10:5\). Jozabad is listed among the Levites who had married foreign women and agreed to send them away \([[Ezra.10.23|Ezra 10:23]]\). 

This event highlights the importance of maintaining religious and cultural purity among the Israelites, especially in the post-exilic period when they were re-establishing their identity and covenant relationship with God.
