- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.10.14|Neh.10.14]]; 
- only referred to as Pahath-moab **<big>[[H6355|פַּחַת מוֹאָב]]</big>**.

Pahath-moab is listed among the leaders who signed the covenant of renewal during the time of Nehemiah \([[Neh.10.14|Nehemiah 10:14]]\). After the completion of the wall of Jerusalem and the public reading of the Law, the people of Israel entered into a covenant to obey God's commandments and to separate themselves from the surrounding nations. The leaders of the people, including Pahath-moab, signed this covenant on behalf of their families and clans, pledging to follow God's law and to support the temple service. The presence of Pahath-moab's name among the signatories indicates that he was a prominent leader within the community and that he represented a significant group of people. This covenant signing was a crucial moment in the history of the Jewish people, as it marked a renewed commitment to God and a determination to maintain their identity as a covenant community.
