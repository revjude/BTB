Mahanaim was a city located east of the Jordan River, in the territory allocated to the tribe of Gad \([[Josh.13.26|Joshua 13:26]], 30\). It was designated as a Levitical city for the Merarites \([[Josh.21.38|Joshua 21:38]]; [[1Chr.6.80|1 Chronicles 6:80]]\). Mahanaim is first mentioned in [[Gen.32.2|Genesis 32:2]], where Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) encountered angels on his way back to Canaan, and he named the place Mahanaim, meaning "two camps." During the reign of King David, Mahanaim served as a refuge for David when he fled from his son Absalom's rebellion \([[2Sam.17.24|2 Samuel 17:24]], 27\). Ishbosheth, Saul's son, was also based in Mahanaim when he ruled over Israel \([[2Sam.2.8|2 Samuel 2:8]], 12, 29\). Later, during Solomon's reign, Mahanaim was the center of one of the twelve districts governed by Solomon's officers \([[1Kgs.4.14|1 Kings 4:14]]\).
