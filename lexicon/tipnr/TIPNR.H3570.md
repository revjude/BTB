<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Cushi</span> was the great grandfather of Jehudi, who was sent to fetch Baruch to read Jeremiah's scroll. \([[Jer.36.14|Jer.36.14]]\)
- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[Jer.36.14|Jer.36.14]]; 
- only referred to as Cushi **<big>[[H3570|כּוּשִׁי]]</big>**; 
-  father of Shelemiah **<big>[[H8018|שֶׁלֶמְיָה]]</big>**.

Cushi is mentioned in [[Jer.36.14|Jeremiah 36:14]] as the father of Jehudi, a man involved in the events surrounding Jeremiah's prophetic scroll. When Micaiah informed the officials about the contents of the scroll that Baruch had read in the people's hearing, the officials sent Jehudi to summon Baruch and bring the scroll. 

Jehudi's task was to fetch Baruch, who had written down Jeremiah's prophecies, and have him read the scroll before the officials. This event took place during the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah when Jeremiah's prophecies were causing concern among the royal officials. 

Apart from being identified as Jehudi's father, no other information is provided about Cushi in the Bible. His name suggests that he or his ancestors may have had a connection to the land of Cush, but this is not explicitly stated in the text.
