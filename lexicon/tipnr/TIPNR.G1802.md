Enoch, the son of Jared, is a significant figure in the genealogy of the righteous line of Seth \([[Gen.5.18|Gen.5.18]],19\). He is described as a man who walked with God, indicating his close relationship and faithfulness to the Creator \([[Gen.5.22|Gen.5.22]],24\). Enoch's life is characterized by his exceptional piety and devotion, which sets him apart from the other individuals in the genealogy. The text states that Enoch lived a total of 365 years \([[Gen.5.23|Gen.5.23]]\), which is notably shorter than the lifespans of the other patriarchs mentioned in the genealogy. The most remarkable aspect of Enoch's life is that he did not experience death; instead, God took him directly into His presence \([[Gen.5.24|Gen.5.24]]\). This event is later referenced in the New Testament as an example of faith and divine favor \([[Heb.11.5|Heb.11.5]]\). Enoch is also mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus Christ, linking him to the Messianic lineage \([[Luke.3.37|Luk.3.37]]\). In the book of Jude, Enoch is described as a prophet who spoke about the judgment of the ungodly \([[Jude.1.14|Jud.1.14]]\), indicating that he had a role in proclaiming God's message to his generation. Enoch's life serves as an example of a faithful servant of God who maintained a close relationship with Him in the midst of a world that was increasingly distant from the Creator.
