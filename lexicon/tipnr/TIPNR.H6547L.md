Pharaoh living at the time of Divided Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Pharaoh</span>, the Egyptian ruler whom Judah's King Hezekiah sought as an ally against the Assyrian threat.
- An Egyptian Pharaoh living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Kgs.18.21|2Ki.18.21]]; 
- only referred to as Pharaoh **<big>[[H6547|פַּרְעֹה]]</big>**.

This Pharaoh was the Egyptian ruler during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah \([[2Kgs.18.21|2 Kings 18:21]]; [[Isa.36.6|Isaiah 36:6]]\). When Judah was threatened by the Assyrian Empire, Hezekiah sought an alliance with Egypt, hoping to receive military support. However, the prophet Isaiah warned against relying on Egypt, comparing Pharaoh's support to a broken reed that would pierce the hand of anyone who leaned on it \([[Isa.36.6|Isaiah 36:6]]\). 

Isaiah also prophesied against Egypt, mocking the wisdom of Pharaoh's counselors and predicting that their advice would lead Egypt astray \(Isaiah 19:11-14\). He warned Judah not to seek refuge in Egypt or rely on Pharaoh's protection \([[Isa.30.2|Isaiah 30:2]]-3\). 

The specific identity of this Pharaoh is not provided in the Bible. However, based on the historical and archaeological evidence, some scholars suggest that he may have been Shabaka or Shebitku, rulers of the 25th Dynasty of Egypt \(Nubian Pharaohs\), who were contemporary with Hezekiah's reign and engaged in conflicts with the Assyrian Empire.
