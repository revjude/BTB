Shelemiah is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.39|Ezra 10:39]] as one of the Israelites who had married foreign women during the time of Ezra. After the return from Babylonian exile, Ezra led a reform to purify the community and separate from foreign influences. As part of this reform, the Israelites who had married foreign wives were required to send them away. Shelemiah was among those who agreed to do so, but no further details are given about his life or family.
