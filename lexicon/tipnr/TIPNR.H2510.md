Mount Halak was a mountain that served as a significant geographical marker in the accounts of Joshua's conquests in the Promised Land. It is mentioned twice in the book of Joshua as a reference point for the southern extent of the territory conquered by Joshua and the Israelites. In [[Josh.11.17|Joshua 11:17]], Mount Halak is described as the mountain that goes up to Seir, marking the southern boundary of the land taken by Joshua, extending from Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak. In [[Josh.12.7|Joshua 12:7]], Mount Halak is again mentioned as the southern limit of the land that Joshua gave as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel. The exact location of Mount Halak is not specified in the Bible, but based on the geographical references, it is believed to be situated in the Negev region, possibly in the vicinity of the Ascent of Akrabbim and the border of Edom. Mount Halak's mention in the accounts of Joshua's conquests highlights the extent of the Israelites' victories and the fulfillment of God's promise to give them the land of Canaan.
