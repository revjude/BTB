Mahath is mentioned in 2 Chronicles as one of the Levites who participated in the purification of the temple during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah \([[2Chr.29.12|2Ch.29.12]]\). Hezekiah initiated a religious reform that included the cleansing and restoration of the temple, which had fallen into disrepair and neglect under the previous kings \(2Ch.29.3-11\). Mahath, along with other Levites from the clans of Kohath and Merari, was summoned by the king to assist in this important task \([[2Chr.29.12|2Ch.29.12]]\). The Levites played a crucial role in the temple's purification, as they were responsible for removing the unclean items, carrying them outside the city, and preparing the temple for proper worship \(2Ch.29.15-19\). Mahath's participation in this event highlights the significance of the Levites in maintaining the religious life of Judah and their dedication to restoring proper worship practices. No further details are provided about Mahath's personal life or his other responsibilities as a Levite. His inclusion in the biblical record emphasizes the importance of religious reform and the collective effort required to maintain the purity and sanctity of the temple.
