- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[Zeph.1.1|Zep.1.1]]; 
- only referred to as Cushi **<big>[[H3569|כּוּשִׁי]]</big>**; 
- a son of Gedaliah **<big>[[H1436|גְּדַּלְיָה]]</big>**; 
-  father of Zephaniah **<big>[[H6846|צְפַנְיָה]]</big>**.

Cushi is mentioned in [[Zeph.1.1|Zephaniah 1:1]] as part of the prophet Zephaniah's genealogy. He is listed as the father of Gedaliah and the son of Amariah, who was the son of Hezekiah. This genealogy serves to introduce Zephaniah and establish his lineage. 

The name Cushi may indicate that he or his ancestors had a connection to the land of Cush, which is associated with the region south of Egypt, including parts of modern-day Sudan and Ethiopia. However, it is not uncommon for names to be passed down through generations, and the name itself does not necessarily imply that Cushi himself was from that region. 

Apart from being mentioned in Zephaniah's genealogy, no other details about Cushi's life or role are provided in the Bible. His inclusion in the genealogy helps to establish Zephaniah's background and family heritage.
