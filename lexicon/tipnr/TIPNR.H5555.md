The Rock of Escape, also known as Sela-hammahlekoth in Hebrew, was a location in the wilderness of Maon where Saul was pursuing David. When Saul and his men were about to close in on David and his followers, a messenger arrived informing Saul that the Philistines had invaded the land. Saul then broke off his pursuit of David to fight against the Philistines. As a result, the place was named the Rock of Escape or the Rock of Divisions \(1 Sa. 23:28\). The exact location of this site is unknown, but it was likely situated in the wilderness area near Maon, in the Judean hills south of Hebron.
