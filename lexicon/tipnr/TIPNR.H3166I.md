- A man from the tribe of Levi living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[1Chr.23.19|1Ch.23.19]]; 
- only referred to as Jahaziel **<big>[[H3166|יַחֲזִיאֵל]]</big>**;

Jahaziel is mentioned in [[1Chr.23.19|1 Chronicles 23:19]] and 24:23 as a Levite, a son of Hebron, and a chief of the Hebronites during the reign of King David. These passages are part of a larger section that describes the organization and duties of the Levites in the service of the temple. 

In 1 Chronicles 23, the Levites are divided into their ancestral houses, with the descendants of Hebron being listed in verses 12 and 19. Jahaziel is named as one of the sons of Hebron, along with Jeriah, Amariah, and Jekameam \([[1Chr.23.19|1Ch.23.19]]\). 

In the following chapter, 1 Chronicles 24, the Levites are organized into divisions for their service in the temple. Once again, Jahaziel is mentioned as a son of Hebron \([[1Chr.24.23|1Ch.24.23]]\), reinforcing his lineage and position within the Levitical family. 

As a chief of the Hebronites, Jahaziel would have had a leadership role among his family members and fellow Levites. The Hebronites were one of the major families within the Levitical tribe, descended from Hebron, the son of Kohath \(1Ch.23.12\). 

No other specific details are provided about Jahaziel's life, personal characteristics, or specific duties. His inclusion in these genealogical records, however, highlights the importance of the Levitical lineage and the organization of the Levites for their service in the temple during the time of David.
