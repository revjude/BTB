Shemaiah was a Levite who lived during the reign of King Josiah of Judah. In [[2Chr.35.9|2 Chronicles 35:9]], he is mentioned along with Conaniah, Nethanel, and Hashabiah as leaders of the Levites who gave 5,000 Passover offerings and 500 bulls to the Levites for the Passover celebrations. This contribution was part of Josiah's great Passover observance, which followed his reforms and the rediscovery of the Book of the Law. Shemaiah's willingness to provide for the Passover offerings demonstrates the Levites' support for Josiah's efforts to restore proper worship and religious practices in Judah.
