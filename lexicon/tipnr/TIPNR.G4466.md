He was born when Peleg was 30 years old \([[Gen.11.18|Genesis 11:18]]\) and lived for a total of 239 years \([[Gen.11.20|Genesis 11:20]]-21\). Reu fathered Serug at the age of 32 and lived an additional 207 years, having other sons and daughters \([[Gen.11.19|Genesis 11:19]]-21\). He is listed as one of the descendants of Shem, the son of Noah, and is part of the lineage that traces from Adam to Abraham, and ultimately to Jesus Christ \([[Luke.3.35|Luke 3:35]]\). The name Reu means "friend" or "associate" in Hebrew. His inclusion in the genealogies emphasizes the continuity of the godly line from which the Messiah would eventually come.
