Azel is mentioned in [[1Chr.8.37|1 Chronicles 8:37]]-38 and 9:43-44 as a descendant of Saul, the first king of Israel. He is listed in the genealogy of Saul's family, which is given in two parallel passages in the book of Chronicles. Azel is described as having six sons: Azrikam, Bokeru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan. The repetition of his sons' names in both passages emphasizes the importance of family lines and the preservation of genealogical records. The inclusion of Azel and his sons in the genealogy of Saul suggests that they were significant figures within the tribe of Benjamin, to which Saul belonged. The genealogies in Chronicles serve to trace the lineage of important individuals and to demonstrate the continuity of the people of Israel, even after the exile.
