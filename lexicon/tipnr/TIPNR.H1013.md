<small>*In Judea • Town associated with the descendants of Hareph.*</small>

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Beth-gader</span> was a town associated with the descendants of Hareph, mentioned in the genealogy of Judah. \([[1Chr.2.51|1 Chronicles 2:51]]\)
- A location in Judea only mentioned at [[1Chr.2.51|1Ch.2.51]]; 
- only referred to as Beth-gader<[[H1013]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>ֵּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ית</span>־<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ג</span>ָּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ֵ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>\).

Beth-gader is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[1Chr.2.51|1 Chronicles 2:51]], as part of the genealogy of the tribe of Judah. The verse states, "Salma the father of Bethlehem, Hareph the father of Beth-gader." 

The name Beth-gader means "house of the wall" or "house of the fortress" in Hebrew, possibly indicating that the town was known for its fortifications or defensive structures. 

Based on the context of the genealogy, Beth-gader was likely located within the territory of Judah, but its exact location is unknown. The town is mentioned alongside Bethlehem, which suggests that it may have been in the same general region, possibly in the hill country of Judah. 

The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 2 traces the descendants of Judah, focusing on the clans and families that emerged from his lineage.
