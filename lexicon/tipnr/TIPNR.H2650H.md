Huppim, also referred to as Hupham or Huram, is mentioned in the genealogies of Benjamin in [[Gen.46.21|Genesis 46:21]], [[Num.26.39|Numbers 26:39]], and [[1Chr.8.5|1 Chronicles 8:5]]. He is listed as one of the sons or descendants of Benjamin. 

In [[Gen.46.21|Genesis 46:21]], Huppim is mentioned alongside other sons of Benjamin, including Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, and Ard. This genealogy is given in the context of Jacob's family going down to Egypt during the time of Joseph. 

In [[Num.26.39|Numbers 26:39]], Huppim is referred to as Hupham, and his descendants are called the Huphamites. This passage is part of the census taken by Moses and Eleazar in the plains of Moab, near the Jordan across from Jericho. The census was conducted to determine the number of men from each tribe who were able to go to war. 

In [[1Chr.8.5|1 Chronicles 8:5]], Huppim is mentioned as one of the sons of Bela, who was a son of Benjamin. This genealogy is part of a larger record of the descendants of Benjamin. 

The variations in the name \(Huppim, Hupham, or Huram\) may be due to different spellings or pronunciations used in different traditions or may refer to the same person. 

Apart from being mentioned in these genealogies, no other information is provided about Huppim in the Bible. His inclusion in the records demonstrates the importance of family lineage and tribal identity in ancient Israelite society.
