Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Publius</span>, the chief official of Malta, who hosted Paul and his companions for three days after their shipwreck on the island.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Num.26.23|Act.28.7]]; 
- only referred to as Publius<[[G4196]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Πόπλιος</span>\).

Publius was the chief official of the island of Malta, as mentioned in Acts 28:7-8. He is described as the "leading man of the island" \(Acts 28:7\), which suggests that he held a position of authority, possibly as a Roman official or a local leader. When Paul and his companions were shipwrecked on Malta, Publius welcomed them and hosted them for three days, showing generous hospitality. During their stay, Paul learned that Publius' father was ill with fever and dysentery. Paul visited the father, prayed for him, and laid his hands on him, resulting in the father's healing \(Acts 28:8\). This event likely had a significant impact on Publius and the local population, as it demonstrated the power of the God that Paul served. The hospitality and kindness shown by Publius to Paul and his companions is a notable example of the welcome and support that the early Christians sometimes received from non-believers during their travels.
