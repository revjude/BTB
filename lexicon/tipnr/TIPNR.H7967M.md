Shallum, mentioned in 1 Chronicles 9:17-19,31, [[Ezra.2.42|Ezra 2:42]], and [[Neh.7.45|Nehemiah 7:45]], was a gatekeeper of the tabernacle during the reign of King David. He is described as the chief of the gatekeepers and is credited with overseeing the gates. Shallum's lineage is traced back to Korah, indicating that he was a descendant of the Korahites, a Levitical family entrusted with the responsibility of guarding the entrance to the tabernacle. The gatekeepers played a crucial role in maintaining the sanctity and security of the tabernacle and later the temple. Shallum's descendants continued to serve as gatekeepers, as evidenced by their mention in the lists of those who returned from the Babylonian exile. In addition to his role as a gatekeeper, Shallum is also mentioned as being in charge of baking the showbread, which was a sacred offering placed before the Lord in the tabernacle. This suggests that he had additional responsibilities related to the preparation of sacred items used in worship.
