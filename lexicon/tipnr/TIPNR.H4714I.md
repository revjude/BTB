The Egypt Sea is mentioned in [[Isa.11.15|Isaiah 11:15]] as a place that will be dried up when the Lord comes to deliver His people. Based on the context, this is likely referring to the Gulf of Suez, the western arm of the Red Sea that borders Egypt. 

The Red Sea was the site of the miraculous crossing of the Israelites during the Exodus from Egypt \(Exodus 14\). Isaiah's prophecy uses imagery reminiscent of that event to depict a future deliverance and restoration of God's people from the nations where they have been exiled. Just as God opened a path through the sea to redeem Israel from Egypt, so will He bring them back from the lands of their captivity.
