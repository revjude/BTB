Cyprus is an island located in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, known in the Bible by various names, including Kittim and Elishah. In the Old Testament, the island is mentioned in the context of trade and prophecy. [[Isa.23.1|Isaiah 23:1]], 12 and [[Jer.2.10|Jeremiah 2:10]] refer to the ships of Kittim, indicating the island's involvement in maritime trade. [[Ezek.27.6|Ezekiel 27:6]] mentions the use of ivory from the coasts of Elishah \(possibly Cyprus\) in the construction of ships. 

In [[Num.24.24|Numbers 24:24]] and [[Dan.11.30|Daniel 11:30]], Kittim is associated with ships that come against the people of God, possibly referring to the island's role in military campaigns or as a base for hostile forces. 

In the New Testament, Cyprus plays a significant role in the spread of early Christianity. The apostle Barnabas, a Levite from Cyprus \(Acts 4:36\), and some unnamed believers from the island were among the first to preach the gospel to the Gentiles in Antioch \(Acts 11:19-20\). Barnabas and Saul \(Paul\) visited Cyprus during their first missionary journey \(Acts 13:4\), where they encountered the sorcerer Elymas and converted the proconsul Sergius Paulus \(Acts 13:6-12\). 

Later, Barnabas and Mark sailed to Cyprus after a disagreement with Paul \(Acts 15:39\). Paul also visited the island during his third missionary journey \(Acts 21:3\) and during his journey to Rome as a prisoner \(Acts 27:4\). 

The early Christian community in Cyprus included Mnason, an early disciple who provided lodging for Paul and his companions in Jerusalem \(Acts 21:16\).
