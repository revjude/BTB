Man living at the time of Divided Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Jonathan</span> was a scribe who had a house in Jerusalem that was used as a prison.
- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[Jer.37.15|Jer.37.15]]; 
- only referred to as Jonathan **<big>[[H3083|יְהוֹנָתָן]]</big>**.

Jonathan was a scribe in Jerusalem during the time of King Zedekiah of Judah. His house was used as a prison where the prophet Jeremiah was confined \([[Jer.37.15|Jeremiah 37:15]]\). Jeremiah appealed to King Zedekiah not to send him back to Jonathan's house, fearing he would die there \([[Jer.37.20|Jeremiah 37:20]]\). Later, Jeremiah told the king's officials that he had only petitioned the king not to send him back to Jonathan's house to die when they questioned him \([[Jer.38.26|Jeremiah 38:26]]\). Jonathan's role as a scribe and the use of his house as a prison suggest he was a person of some importance in Jerusalem just prior to the Babylonian conquest in 586 BC.
