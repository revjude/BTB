Madmen is mentioned in [[Jer.48.2|Jeremiah 48:2]] as a place in Moab that is threatened with destruction in the prophecies of Jeremiah. The verse states, "There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee" \(KJV\). The play upon the words in the original Hebrew suggests a possible error in transcription, with the initial "M" of "Madmen" possibly arising by dittography from the last letter of the preceding word "gam." The location is not provided in the Bible.
