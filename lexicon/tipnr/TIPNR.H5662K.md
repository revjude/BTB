Obadiah, also known as Abda, was a gatekeeper in the temple during the post-exilic period \([[1Chr.9.16|1 Chronicles 9:16]]; [[Neh.12.25|Nehemiah 12:25]]\). He was a descendant of Jeduthun, one of the three principal musicians appointed by David \(1 Chronicles 16:41-42\). Obadiah's duties as a gatekeeper likely included guarding the entrance to the temple, maintaining order, and ensuring that only authorized individuals entered the sacred space. He was also a singer and was involved in the musical aspects of temple worship \([[Neh.11.17|Nehemiah 11:17]]\). His service in the temple highlights the importance of the Levitical roles in maintaining the proper functioning of the temple and its worship.
