- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Zech.7.2|Zec.7.2]]; 
- only referred to as Regem-melech **<big>[[H7278|רֶגֶם מֶלֶךְ]]</big>**.

Regem-melech is mentioned in the book of Zechariah as one of the messengers sent by the people of Bethel to inquire of the Lord \([[Zech.7.2|Zechariah 7:2]]\). The context suggests that this event took place after the return of the Jews from Babylonian exile and during the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem. The people of Bethel sent Regem-melech and his companions to the house of God \(the temple\) to pray and to ask the priests and prophets a question regarding fasting and mourning \(Zechariah 7:3\). The people wanted to know if they should continue to observe the fasts they had established during the exile, now that the temple was being rebuilt. In response, the Lord spoke through Zechariah, emphasizing that true obedience and justice were more important than formal fasting \(Zechariah 7:4-14\). The mention of Regem-melech highlights the people's desire for guidance and their willingness to seek the Lord's direction through the priests and prophets.
