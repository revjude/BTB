Kir, also referred to as Mizpeh, was a city in Moab, east of the Dead Sea. It is mentioned several times in the prophetic books of Isaiah and Jeremiah in the context of God's judgment against Moab. Isaiah prophesied that Kir would be destroyed in a night \([[Isa.15.1|Isaiah 15:1]]\), and Jeremiah foretold that Kir would face judgment and destruction by the Babylonians \(Jeremiah 48:1, 23\). The city was known for its fortifications, as the name "Kir" means "wall" or "fortress." According to [[2Kgs.3.25|2 Kings 3:25]], during the campaign of the kings of Israel, Judah, and Edom against Moab, they destroyed the cities and stopped up the springs of water, including those of Kir-hareseth, which may be another name for Kir. The exact location of Kir is uncertain, but it was likely situated in southern Moab, possibly near the modern-day town of Al-Karak.
