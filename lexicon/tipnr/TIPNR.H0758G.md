Aram is mentioned in [[Gen.10.22|Genesis 10:22]],23 and [[1Chr.1.17|1 Chronicles 1:17]] as one of the sons of Shem, the son of Noah. He is listed among the descendants of Shem and is identified as the ancestor of the Arameans, a Semitic people who inhabited the regions of Syria and Mesopotamia. The Arameans played a significant role in the history of the ancient Near East, and their language, Aramaic, became a common language of trade and diplomacy. Aram's descendants spread throughout the region, establishing various Aramean kingdoms and city-states.
