- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[2Chr.34.12|2Ch.34.12]]; 
- only referred to as Jahath<[[H3189K]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ַ֫<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ח</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ת</span>\).

Jahath is mentioned in [[2Chr.34.12|2 Chronicles 34:12]] as one of the Levites who supervised the repairs of the temple during the reign of King Josiah. Along with Obadiah, another Levite, Jahath is described as a faithful supervisor over the workmen who were restoring the house of the Lord. 

King Josiah, who reigned from around 640 to 609 BC, initiated significant religious reforms in Judah, which included the repair and restoration of the temple in Jerusalem \(2Ch.34.8\). As part of this process, Jahath and Obadiah were appointed to oversee the work of the laborers and craftsmen involved in the temple repairs. 

The text specifies that Jahath and Obadiah were from the Merarites, one of the three main divisions of the Levites, along with the Kohathites and the Gershonites \(1Ch.23.6\). The Levites were the tribe set apart for religious duties and the service of the tabernacle and later the temple. 

Jahath's role as a supervisor highlights the importance of the Levites not only in the religious ceremonies but also in the practical aspects of maintaining and restoring the temple. His faithfulness in overseeing the work is commended in the text, emphasizing the significance of diligence and integrity in the service of God. 

No other specific details are provided about Jahath's life or other responsibilities. His mention in this context, however, underscores the vital role played by the Levites in the preservation and restoration of the temple during the time of Josiah's reforms.
