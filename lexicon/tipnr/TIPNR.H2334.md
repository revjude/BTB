Havvoth-jair, meaning "the villages of Jair," were settlements in the region of Gilead, east of the Jordan River. Jair, a leader from the tribe of Manasseh, captured these villages during the Israelite conquest of the Promised Land \([[Num.32.41|Num.32.41]]\). The territory was named after Jair and became part of the inheritance of the half-tribe of Manasseh settled in Gilead \(Deut 3:14\). Later, another Jair from Gilead, who judged Israel for twenty-two years, had thirty sons who controlled thirty towns, also known as Havvoth-jair \(Judg 10:4\). In [[1Chr.2.23|1 Chronicles 2:23]], it is mentioned that Geshur and Aram captured some of these villages from the descendants of Jair.
