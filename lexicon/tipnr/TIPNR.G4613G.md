Apostle living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Simon</span>, also known as the Zealot, was one of the twelve apostles chosen by Jesus.
- An apostle living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Matt.10.4|Mat.10.4]]; 
- referred to as Simon<[[G4613G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Σίμων</span>\), or Zealot \(KJV= Zelotes\) <[[G2208]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>ζηλωτής</span>\).

Simon, also called the Zealot, was one of the twelve apostles chosen by Jesus Christ \([[Matt.10.4|Matthew 10:4]]; [[Mark.3.18|Mark 3:18]]; [[Luke.6.15|Luke 6:15]]\). The title "Zealot" likely indicates that Simon belonged to a Jewish political faction known for its fierce nationalism and opposition to Roman rule before following Jesus. 

After Jesus' ascension, Simon the Zealot is mentioned as being among the apostles who gathered in the upper room in Jerusalem to pray and await the coming of the Holy Spirit \(Acts 1:13\). 

Beyond these brief mentions, no further details about Simon the Zealot's life or ministry are provided in the New Testament. Church tradition holds that he preached the gospel in various regions, possibly including Egypt, North Africa, and Persia, before being martyred for his faith, though the accounts vary.
