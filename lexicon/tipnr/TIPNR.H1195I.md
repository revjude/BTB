Baana son of Zadok is briefly mentioned in [[Neh.3.4|Nehemiah 3:4]] as one of the people who helped repair the wall of Jerusalem. During the time of Nehemiah, the city's walls were in disrepair, leaving the inhabitants vulnerable. Nehemiah organized a massive rebuilding effort, with different individuals and families taking responsibility for specific sections. Baana worked on restoring a portion of the wall alongside Meremoth son of Uriah. The text does not provide any further details about Baana's background or role in the community. However, his participation in the wall rebuilding project suggests he was a man of some means and influence who was willing to contribute to the important task of fortifying Jerusalem.
