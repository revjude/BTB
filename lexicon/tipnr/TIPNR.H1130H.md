Ben-hadad II was the king of Aram \(Syria\) during the time of the prophet Elisha and King Joram of Israel. In [[2Kgs.6.24|2 Kings 6:24]], Ben-hadad II besieges Samaria, causing a severe famine in the city. The siege is lifted when the Lord causes the Aramean army to hear the sound of a great army, leading them to flee in fear and leave behind their provisions \(2 Kings 7:6-7\). Later, in [[2Kgs.8.7|2 Kings 8:7]]-9, Ben-hadad II becomes ill and sends his servant Hazael to inquire of Elisha whether he will recover. Elisha prophesies that Ben-hadad will die and that Hazael will become king in his place. Hazael returns to Ben-hadad, telling him that he will recover, but the next day he takes a cloth, soaks it in water, and spreads it over Ben-hadad's face, causing his death. Hazael then succeeds him as king of Aram \(2 Kings 8:15\). Ben-hadad II's reign was marked by his military campaigns against Israel and his interaction with the prophet Elisha, whose prophecies and miracles had a significant impact on the political events of the time.
