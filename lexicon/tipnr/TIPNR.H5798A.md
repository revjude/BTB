Uzzah was a man who died while transporting the ark of the covenant. He and his brother Ahio were guiding the cart carrying the ark when the oxen stumbled. Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the ark, but God struck him down for his irreverent act, and he died there beside the ark. The place where this occurred was named Perez-uzzah, which means "outbreak against Uzzah," and David was angry and afraid because of this divine judgment. The ark was then taken aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
