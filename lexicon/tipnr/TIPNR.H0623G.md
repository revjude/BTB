Asaph was an official who served as the recorder during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. When the Assyrian king Sennacherib invaded Judah and threatened Jerusalem, Hezekiah sent a delegation, including Asaph, to meet with the Assyrian officials. The Assyrian representative, the Rabshakeh, delivered a threatening message, urging the people of Jerusalem to surrender. Asaph, along with the other officials, tore their clothes in distress and reported the message to Hezekiah. As the recorder, Asaph likely had responsibilities related to official records and correspondence in the royal court.
