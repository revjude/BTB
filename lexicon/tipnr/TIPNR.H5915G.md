Achsah was the daughter of Caleb, one of the Israelite leaders during the conquest of Canaan. When Caleb was given the city of Hebron as his inheritance, he promised to give his daughter Achsah in marriage to whoever would capture the nearby city of Kiriath-sepher \([[Josh.15.16|Joshua 15:16]]; [[Judg.1.12|Judges 1:12]]\). 

Othniel, Caleb's nephew and the son of Kenaz, successfully captured Kiriath-sepher, and so Achsah was given to him in marriage \([[Josh.15.17|Joshua 15:17]]; [[Judg.1.13|Judges 1:13]]\). As Achsah was going to Othniel, she urged him to ask her father for a field \(Judges 1:14\). 

Achsah then approached her father Caleb and requested that he give her springs of water in addition to the land he had already given her, as the land was in the Negev, a dry region \(Joshua 15:18-19; Judges 1:14-15\). Caleb granted her request and gave her the upper and lower springs \(Joshua 15:19; Judges 1:15\). 

Achsah's story highlights the importance of water resources in the arid regions of Canaan and demonstrates the boldness and resourcefulness of a woman in securing a valuable blessing for herself and her husband. Her request for springs of water also shows the significance of a father's blessing and provision for his daughter upon her marriage.
