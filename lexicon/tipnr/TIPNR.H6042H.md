- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.12.9|Neh.12.9]]; 
- only referred to as Unni<[[H6042H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ֻ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ִּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>\).

Unni is mentioned briefly in [[Neh.12.9|Nehemiah 12:9]] as one of the Levites who assisted in the temple during the post-exilic period, specifically during the time of Nehemiah. He is listed alongside Bakbukiah as a leader who supervised the thanksgiving hymns. This suggests that Unni had a role in organizing and overseeing the musical aspects of worship in the rebuilt temple. The mention of Unni in this context highlights the restoration of proper worship practices and the involvement of the Levites in the religious life of the Jewish community after their return from Babylonian exile.
