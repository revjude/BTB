John, the son of Zebedee, is a prominent figure in the New Testament. He is one of the twelve apostles chosen by Jesus and is often referred to as "the disciple whom Jesus loved" \(John 13:23\). John worked as a fisherman alongside his brother James and their father Zebedee \([[Matt.4.21|Matthew 4:21]]; [[Mark.1.19|Mark 1:19]]\). 

Throughout the Gospels, John is depicted as a close companion of Jesus. He witnesses significant events, including the Transfiguration \([[Matt.17.1|Matthew 17:1]]; [[Mark.9.2|Mark 9:2]]\), and is present during Jesus' agony in the Garden of Gethsemane \([[Mark.14.33|Mark 14:33]]\). He is also noted for his role in the early church, as seen in the Acts of the Apostles, where he actively preached and performed miracles \(Acts 3:1-4; 4:13\). 

John is traditionally believed to be the author of the Gospel of John, three epistles \(1 John, 2 John, 3 John\), and the Book of Revelation \([[Rev.1.1|Revelation 1:1]], 4, 9; 22:8\). In Revelation, he describes visions of the end times and the New Jerusalem \([[Rev.21.2|Revelation 21:2]]\). 

John's contributions to the New Testament and his close relationship with Jesus have established him as a pivotal figure in Christian tradition. His writings emphasize love, faith, and the divinity of Christ.
