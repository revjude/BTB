Naarah is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.4.5|1 Chronicles 4:5]]-6 as one of the two wives of Ashhur, the  father \(ie founder\) of Tekoa. This reference appears in a genealogical record that traces the descendants of Judah, providing insight into the family lines within the tribe. 

According to the text, Ashhur had two wives, Helah and Naarah. Naarah gave birth to Ahuzzam, Hepher, Temeni, and Haahashtari. These were the sons of Naarah, indicating that she played a role in the growth and development of Ashhur's family. 

The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 4 lists several generations of Judahites, focusing on the descendants of various clans and families within the tribe. The mention of Naarah and her sons serves to provide a more detailed record of Ashhur's family line and their contributions to the tribe of Judah. 

Apart from being listed as the wife of Ashhur and the mother of four sons, no additional information is provided about Naarah's life, character, or other roles she may have played. Her inclusion in the genealogy highlights the importance of family relationships and the recognition of the role women played in the growth and continuity of the tribal lineage.
