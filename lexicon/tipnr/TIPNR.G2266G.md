Herodias was the wife of Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee during the time of Jesus' ministry. She was originally married to Herod Philip, the half-brother of Herod Antipas, but later divorced him to marry Herod Antipas \([[Matt.14.3|Mat.14.3]]; [[Mark.6.17|Mrk.6.17]]; [[Luke.3.19|Luk.3.19]]\). John the Baptist openly condemned this marriage as unlawful, which led to his imprisonment by Herod Antipas \([[Matt.14.3|Mat.14.3]]-4; [[Mark.6.17|Mrk.6.17]]-18; [[Luke.3.19|Luk.3.19]]-20\). Herodias held a grudge against John and wanted to have him killed, but Herod Antipas feared the multitude who regarded John as a prophet \(Mat.14.5; [[Mark.6.19|Mrk.6.19]]-20\). On Herod Antipas's birthday, Herodias's daughter danced before the guests, pleasing Herod Antipas, who promised to give her whatever she asked \([[Matt.14.6|Mat.14.6]]-7; Mrk.6.21-23\). Prompted by her mother Herodias, the daughter asked for the head of John the Baptist on a platter \(Mat.14.8; Mrk.6.24-25\). Although reluctant, Herod Antipas fulfilled the request and had John beheaded in prison \(Mat.14.9-11; Mrk.6.26-28\).
