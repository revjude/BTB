Zechariah was a Levite who lived during the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah. As part of Jehoshaphat's reforms to strengthen the spiritual life of the nation, he sent out Levites and priests to teach the Book of the Law to the people in the cities of Judah. Zechariah was among the Levites chosen for this important task, along with Ben-hail, Obadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah. They were accompanied by the priests Elishama and Jehoram.

Zechariah's participation in this endeavor highlights the role of the Levites as teachers and spiritual guides for the nation.
