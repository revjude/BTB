Dedan was an Arabian people and region, mentioned in both the Old and New Testaments. They were descendants of Abraham through his wife Keturah \(Genesis 25:3\). The Dedanites were known for their involvement in trade, particularly in luxury goods such as ivory, ebony, and precious cloths \([[Ezek.27.15|Ezekiel 27:15]], 20\). The region of Dedan was likely located in the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula, near Edom. The Dedanites are mentioned in prophetic oracles concerning God's judgment against the nations \([[Jer.25.23|Jeremiah 25:23]]; 49:8; [[Ezek.25.13|Ezekiel 25:13]]; 38:13\), indicating their significance in the ancient Near East. In [[Isa.21.13|Isaiah 21:13]], a prophecy is directed to the caravans of Dedanites, warning them of impending danger, further emphasizing their role in trade and travel.
