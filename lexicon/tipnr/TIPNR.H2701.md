Hazar-susah, meaning "village of horses," was a town located in the Negev, the southern region of the Promised Land. It was part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Simeon within the inheritance of Judah \(Josh 19:5\). No further details about Hazar-susah are provided in the Bible, and its exact location remains unknown. The name suggests that the town may have been known for its horses or horse-related activities.
