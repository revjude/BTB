Adami-nekeb is mentioned in [[Josh.19.33|Joshua 19:33]] as one of the landmarks delineating the boundary of the territory allotted to the tribe of Naphtali. It is described as being on the border that ran from Heleph and the oak in Zaanannim, near Lakkum, and on to the Jordan River. The name Adami-nekeb means "the pass of Adami" or "the cavern of Adami," suggesting it may have been a distinctive geographic feature, such as a mountain pass or a cave, used to mark the boundary. Its exact location is unknown, but it was likely situated in the hill country of Upper Galilee, north of the Sea of Galilee, along Naphtali's border.
