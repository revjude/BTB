Rimmon, meaning "pomegranate," was a rock or cliff where 600 Benjamite men fled after a battle with the other Israelite tribes. The conflict arose when the Benjamites refused to surrender the men of Gibeah who had committed a heinous crime \(Jdg. 19-20\). In the ensuing battle, the Benjamites were defeated, and the survivors escaped to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed for four months \(Jdg. 20:45, 47\). Later, the Israelites sent a peace delegation to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon, urging them to return \(Jdg. 21:13\). The exact location of the rock of Rimmon is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the territory of Benjamin, north of Jerusalem.
