Migdal-el is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Josh.19.38|Joshua 19:38]], as one of the fortified cities in the territory allotted to the tribe of Naphtali. The name Migdal-el means "tower of God" in Hebrew. The verse lists Migdal-el along with other fortified cities, such as Iron, Horem, and Beth-anath. These cities were located in the northern part of Canaan, in the region of Galilee. Its location is unknown.
