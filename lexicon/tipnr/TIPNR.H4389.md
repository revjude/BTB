The Mortar \(Hebrew: maktesh\) was a district or valley in or near Jerusalem, mentioned in Zephaniah's prophecy \(Zeph. 1:11\). The exact location is uncertain, but it may have been an area where merchants and traders conducted their business. Zephaniah prophesied that the people of the Mortar would cry out because of the destruction that would come upon them due to their sins.
