- A Cushite king living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Kgs.19.9|2Ki.19.9]]; 
- only referred to as Tirhakah **<big>[[H8640|תִּרְהָקָה]]</big>**.

Tirhakah, also known as Taharqa, was the king of Cush \(Ethiopia\) who opposed the Assyrian king Sennacherib during his invasion of Judah \([[2Kgs.19.9|2 Kings 19:9]]; [[Isa.37.9|Isaiah 37:9]]\). He is mentioned as coming to the aid of King Hezekiah, who was under attack by Sennacherib. Tirhakah was the fourth pharaoh of the Twenty-Fifth \(Ethiopian\) Dynasty of Egypt, ruling from approximately 690 to 664 BC. There is a chronological difficulty in the biblical account, as the events described are believed to have taken place around 701 BC, before Tirhakah's ascension to the throne. Some scholars suggest that Tirhakah may have been acting as a military commander under his predecessor, Pharaoh Shabaka, or that the biblical authors may have combined accounts of two separate campaigns by Sennacherib. Assyrian records also mention Tirhakah's conflict with the Assyrians. Tirhakah's successful opposition to Assyria is recorded on the walls of a temple at Medinet Habu in Egypt.
