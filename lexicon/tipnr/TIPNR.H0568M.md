<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Amariah</span> was a priest who sealed Nehemiah's covenant and later served as a chief priest during the high priesthood of Joiakim. \([[Neh.10.3|Neh.10.3]]; 12.2,13\)
- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Neh.10.3|Neh.10.3]]; 
- only referred to as Amariah **<big>[[H0568|אֲמַרְיָה]]</big>**.

Amariah is mentioned in the context of the religious reforms and the rebuilding of Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah. He was among the priests who sealed the covenant that Nehemiah and the people made to follow the Law of God. \(Neh.10.1-29\) 

By sealing the covenant, Amariah and the other priests pledged to uphold its stipulations, which included observing the Sabbath, providing for the temple service, and refraining from intermarriage with the surrounding peoples. \([[Neh.10.3|Neh.10.3]]0-39\) 

Later, Amariah is listed among the chief priests who served during the high priesthood of Joiakim, the son of Jeshua. \(Neh.12.12-21\) As a chief priest, Amariah would have had a leadership role in the temple service and in guiding the people in their religious practices. 

The mention of Amariah in these contexts highlights the importance of the priesthood in the restoration of Jerusalem and the renewal of the covenant relationship between God and His people. It also demonstrates the continuity of the priestly lineage and the significance of their role in maintaining the religious life of the community.
