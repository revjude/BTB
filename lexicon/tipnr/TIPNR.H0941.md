Buzi was a priest and the father of Ezekiel, one of the major prophets in the Old Testament \(Ezek. 1:3\). Ezekiel, whose name means "God strengthens," was born into a priestly family in Jerusalem. As a priest, Buzi would have served in the temple and been responsible for teaching the people God's laws and offering sacrifices on their behalf. Ezekiel was called by God to be a prophet during the Babylonian exile, and he ministered to the exiled community in Babylon. The mention of Buzi as Ezekiel's father emphasizes the prophet's priestly lineage and highlights the importance of family heritage in Jewish society. It also underscores the significance of Ezekiel's role as both a priest and a prophet, called to proclaim God's message to His people during a time of great upheaval and spiritual crisis.
