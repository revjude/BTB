Havilah was a region located in the northwestern Arabian Peninsula, inhabited by the descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's son \([[Gen.25.18|Gen.25.18]]\). The Ishmaelites settled in the area from Havilah to Shur, which bordered Egypt to the east. During King Saul's reign, he launched a military campaign against the Amalekites, a nomadic people who lived in the region. Saul's army attacked the Amalekites from Havilah to Shur \(1 Sam 15:7\), indicating that Havilah marked the eastern extent of the Amalekite territory. This Havilah is distinct from the one mentioned in the Garden of Eden account and is likely located in what is now northwestern Saudi Arabia.
