Jadon the Meronothite is mentioned in [[Neh.3.7|Nehemiah 3:7]] as one of the people who participated in the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem under Nehemiah's leadership. He is described as working alongside Melatiah the Gibeonite and the men of Gibeon and Mizpah. 

The Meronothites were inhabitants of Meronoth, a town believed to be located in the region of Gibeon, near Jerusalem. Jadon's involvement in the rebuilding project suggests that he was a skilled craftsman or laborer who contributed his expertise to the restoration of the city's defenses. 

Nehemiah 3 provides a detailed account of the various individuals and groups who were responsible for repairing specific sections of the wall. Jadon's inclusion in this list highlights the widespread participation of people from different towns and regions in the rebuilding effort, emphasizing the unity and shared purpose of the Jewish community during this time. 

No other specific details are provided about Jadon's life or personal characteristics. His contribution to the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls, however, demonstrates his commitment to the restoration of the city and the strengthening of the Jewish community in the face of opposition and challenges.
