- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.8.16|Ezr.8.16]]; 
- only referred to as Meshullam **<big>[[H4918|מְשֻׁלָּם]]</big>**.

Meshullam is mentioned in the book of Ezra as one of the leaders summoned by Ezra to assist in teaching the Law to the people \([[Ezra.8.16|Ezr.8.16]]\). Ezra, a priest and scribe, led a group of exiles back to Jerusalem during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia. Upon arriving in Jerusalem, Ezra discovered that many of the people, including priests and Levites, had intermarried with the surrounding nations and adopted their practices. To address this issue, Ezra called for the leaders, including Meshullam, to help him teach the Law to the people and guide them in repentance and obedience to God's commands.
