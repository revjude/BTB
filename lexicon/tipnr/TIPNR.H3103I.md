Jobab, the king of Madon, is mentioned in [[Josh.11.1|Joshua 11:1]] as one of the northern Canaanite kings who formed an alliance against Israel during the conquest of Canaan. When Jabin, king of Hazor, called for the northern kings to unite against Joshua and the Israelites, Jobab joined forces with him, along with the kings of Shimron and Achshaph. This coalition gathered their troops and encamped together at the Waters of Merom to fight against Israel. However, Joshua and the Israelite army launched a surprise attack and defeated them, pursuing and striking them down until no survivors were left \(Jos.11.7-8\).
