- David's compatriot from the tribe of Benjamin living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Sam.14.50|1Sa.14.50]]; 
- only referred to as Abner **<big>[[H0074|אַבְנֵר]]</big>**; 
- a son of Ner **<big>[[H5369|נֵר]]</big>**; 
-  father of Jaasiel **<big>[[H3300|יַעֲשִׂיאֵל]]</big>**.

Abner was the son of Ner and the cousin of King Saul, Israel's first monarch. He served as the commander of Saul's army \([[1Sam.14.50|1 Samuel 14:50]]-51\). Abner was a prominent figure during Saul's reign and demonstrated his loyalty to the king, as seen in his interactions with David \(1 Samuel 17:55-57; 20:25; 26:5-15\). 

After Saul's death, Abner supported Saul's son Ish-bosheth as king over Israel, while David reigned over Judah \([[2Sam.2.8|2 Samuel 2:8]]-10\). During this time, there was a long war between the houses of Saul and David \(2 Samuel 3:1\). Abner led Ish-bosheth's forces against David's army, commanded by Joab \([[2Sam.2.12|2 Samuel 2:12]]-17\). In a battle at Gibeon, Abner killed Joab's brother Asahel, who had pursued him \(2 Samuel 2:18-23\). 

Later, Abner defected to David after a dispute with Ish-bosheth \([[2Sam.3.6|2 Samuel 3:6]]-21\). He worked to transfer the kingdom to David and made an agreement with him \([[2Sam.3.12|2 Samuel 3:12]]-21\). However, Joab, seeking revenge for his brother's death, murdered Abner \([[2Sam.3.22|2 Samuel 3:22]]-27\). David mourned Abner's death and declared his innocence in the matter \([[2Sam.3.28|2 Samuel 3:28]]-39\). 

Abner's defection and death weakened Ish-bosheth's position, and he was eventually assassinated \([[2Sam.4.1|2 Samuel 4:1]]-8\). This paved the way for David to become king over all Israel \(2 Samuel 5:1-5\). David later reminded Solomon of Joab's actions against Abner \([[1Kgs.2.5|1 Kings 2:5]], 32\). Abner is also mentioned in connection with the treasures dedicated to the Lord \([[1Chr.26.28|1 Chronicles 26:28]]\) and as the father of Jaasiel, a leader in David's army \([[1Chr.27.21|1 Chronicles 27:21]]\).
