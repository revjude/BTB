Avith is mentioned twice in the Old Testament \([[Gen.36.35|Genesis 36:35]] and [[1Chr.1.46|1 Chronicles 1:46]]\) as the capital city of Hadad, an early king of Edom. Hadad was the son of Bedad and became king after defeating the Midianites in the land of Moab. Avith is listed as his city, implying that it served as the seat of his reign. The exact location of Avith is unknown, but it was presumably within the territory of Edom, which was located south of the Dead Sea in what is now southern Israel and Jordan.
