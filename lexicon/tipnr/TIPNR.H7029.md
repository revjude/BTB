Kishi, also known as Kushaiah, is mentioned in [[1Chr.6.44|1 Chronicles 6:44]] and 15:17 as a Levite from the clan of Merari. He is identified as the father of Jeduthun \(or 'Ethan'\), a prominent musician in King David's court. 

In the genealogy of the Levites involved in temple service \(1 Chronicles 6:31-48\), Kishi is listed as the ancestor of Ethan, who was one of the main musicians appointed by David to lead worship \([[1Chr.6.44|1 Chronicles 6:44]]\). This highlights the family's involvement in the musical aspects of Levitical service. 

Later, in the context of David bringing the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, Kishi \(Kushaiah\) is again mentioned as the father of Ethan \([[1Chr.15.17|1 Chronicles 15:17]]\). Ethan, along with other skilled musicians, was appointed to play the bronze cymbals during the procession of the Ark. 

The dual naming of Kishi and Kushaiah may indicate that he was known by both names or that one was a variant spelling of the other.  Throughout these passages, Kishi \(Kushaiah\) is primarily known as the father of Ethan, a skilled musician who played a significant role in the worship services during the reign of King David.
