- A priest living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Sam.1.3|1Sa.1.3]]; 
-  son of Eli \(H5941\); 
-  brother of Phinehas \(H6372H\); called Hophni <[[H2652]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ח</span>ׇ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>פ</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>\)

Hophni was one of the two sons of Eli, the high priest of Israel, who served at the tabernacle in Shiloh \([[1Sam.1.3|1 Samuel 1:3]]\). Along with his brother Phinehas, Hophni was known for his corrupt behavior and disregard for the proper handling of the sacrifices and offerings brought to the tabernacle \(1 Samuel 2:12-17\). 

The corrupt practices of Hophni and Phinehas led to the people's disillusionment with the priesthood and a decline in the spiritual life of Israel. As a consequence of their actions, a prophecy was given to Eli, stating that both of his sons would die on the same day \([[1Sam.2.34|1 Samuel 2:34]]\). 

During a battle against the Philistines, the Israelites brought the Ark of the Covenant from Shiloh to the battlefield, accompanied by Hophni and Phinehas \([[1Sam.4.4|1 Samuel 4:4]]\). However, the Israelites were defeated, the Ark was captured, and both Hophni and Phinehas were killed, fulfilling the prophecy \([[1Sam.4.11|1 Samuel 4:11]]\). When Eli heard the news of his sons' deaths and the capture of the Ark, he fell backward from his seat, broke his neck, and died \([[1Sam.4.17|1 Samuel 4:17]]-18\). 

The story of Hophni serves as a warning against the abuse of religious authority and the consequences of disobedience to God's laws. It also highlights the importance of proper worship and the handling of sacred objects in maintaining a right relationship with God.
