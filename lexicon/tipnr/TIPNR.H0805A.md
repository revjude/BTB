- only referred to as Asshurim **<big>[[H0805|אֲשׁוּרִי]]</big>**;

Asshurim is mentioned in the genealogy of Abraham's descendants through his wife Keturah, recorded in Genesis 25. He is listed as one of the sons of Dedan, who was a son of Jokshan and a grandson of Abraham. This genealogy demonstrates the breadth of Abraham's lineage and the various peoples that emerged from his descendants. The Asshurim, along with other descendants of Jokshan, are believed to have settled in the Arabian Peninsula. However, little is known about the specific history or culture of the Asshurim, as they are not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible.
