- People from Ram<[[H7410I]]>, first mentioned at [[Job.32.2|Job.32.2]];

The Buzites were a clan or tribe descended from Buz, the son of Nahor, who was Abraham's brother \(Gen. 22:21\). They are mentioned in the book of Job as the people from whom Elihu, one of Job's friends, came \([[Job.32.2|Job 32:2]], 6\). Elihu is described as "the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram" \([[Job.32.2|Job 32:2]]\). The Buzites likely lived in a region east of the Jordan River, as they are associated with the land of Uz \(Jer. 25:23\). Elihu's presence in the story of Job suggests that the Buzites maintained a belief in the God of Abraham and participated in theological discussions. The mention of the Buzites in the book of Job highlights the interaction between different clans and the shared religious heritage among the descendants of Abraham's extended family.
