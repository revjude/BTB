Jeshaiah is mentioned in the book of Ezra as one of the Levites who accompanied Ezra on his journey from Babylon to Jerusalem. Ezra, a priest and scribe, led a group of Israelites back to Jerusalem to restore the temple and reinstitute the Law of Moses. Jeshaiah, along with other Levites, was sent by Ezra to find ministers for the house of God. The Levites played a crucial role in the temple service, and their presence in Ezra's group underscores the importance of restoring proper worship in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile.
