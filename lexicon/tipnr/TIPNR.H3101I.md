Joash, also known as Jehoash, was the king of Judah and the son of Ahaziah. He became king at the age of seven, after being hidden by his aunt Jehosheba for six years following the usurpation of the throne by Athaliah \([[2Kgs.11.2|2Ki.11.2]]; [[2Chr.22.11|2Ch.22.11]]\). During his forty-year reign \([[2Kgs.12.1|2Ki.12.1]]; [[2Chr.24.1|2Ch.24.1]]\), Joash initiated repairs to the temple of the Lord, which had fallen into disrepair \([[2Kgs.12.4|2Ki.12.4]]-7; [[2Chr.24.4|2Ch.24.4]]\). 

However, after the death of his mentor, Jehoiada the priest, Joash turned away from the Lord and allowed the worship of idols \([[2Chr.24.1|2Ch.24.1]]7-18\). When Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, prophesied against this wickedness, Joash ordered his execution \([[2Chr.24.2|2Ch.24.2]]0-22\). 

Consequently, Judah faced military defeats and Joash was wounded \([[2Chr.24.2|2Ch.24.2]]3-24\). He was eventually assassinated by his own servants and succeeded by his son Amaziah \([[2Kgs.12.20|2Ki.12.20]]-21; [[2Chr.24.2|2Ch.24.2]]5-27\). Joash's reign was marked by both early reforms and later apostasy, highlighting the importance of godly leadership and the consequences of turning away from the Lord.
