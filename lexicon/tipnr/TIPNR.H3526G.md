The Washer's Field, also known as the Fuller's Field, is a location mentioned in the Bible in connection with the walls of Jerusalem and prophetic messages. In [[2Kgs.18.17|2 Kings 18:17]] and [[Isa.36.2|Isaiah 36:2]], it is recorded that the Assyrian king Sennacherib sent his officials, the Tartan, the Rabsaris, and the Rabshakeh, to deliver a message to King Hezekiah of Judah. They stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is on the highway to the Washer's Field, and called for the king. The Washer's Field was likely an area outside the city walls where launderers washed and dried clothes, taking advantage of the water supply from the nearby pool. The prophet Isaiah also mentions the Washer's Field in an earlier prophecy \(Isa. 7:3\), where God instructs him to meet King Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway to the Washer's Field, to deliver a message of reassurance concerning the impending Assyrian threat. The Washer's Field's location near the city walls and its association with important prophetic messages and diplomatic encounters highlight its significance in the biblical narrative.
