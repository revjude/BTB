Pharaoh living at the time of the Patriarchs

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Pharaoh</span>, the Egyptian ruler who elevated Joseph to a position of authority and welcomed his family to Egypt during a severe famine.
- An Egyptian Pharaoh living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.37.36|Gen.37.36]]; 
- referred to as Pharaoh<[[H6547H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>פ</span>ַּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>\), or Pharaoh<[[G5328G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Φαραώ</span>\).

This Pharaoh was the Egyptian ruler during the time of Joseph, the son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) \(Genesis 37-50\). Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers and eventually served in the household of Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's officials. After being falsely accused and imprisoned, Joseph interpreted the dreams of Pharaoh's cupbearer and baker. When Pharaoh had troubling dreams, the cupbearer remembered Joseph's ability, and Joseph was brought before Pharaoh to interpret the dreams. 

Joseph interpreted Pharaoh's dreams as a warning of seven years of plenty followed by seven years of severe famine. Impressed by Joseph's wisdom, Pharaoh appointed him as second-in-command over Egypt to prepare for the famine. During the famine, Joseph's brothers came to Egypt to buy grain, and after a series of tests, Joseph revealed his identity to them. Pharaoh invited Joseph's family to settle in the land of Goshen and provided for their needs. 

This Pharaoh is depicted as a ruler who recognized and rewarded wisdom, and who showed kindness to Joseph and his family. The Bible does not provide the specific name or historical identity of this Pharaoh, as the term "Pharaoh" was used as a title for Egyptian kings. Some scholars suggest that this Pharaoh may have been from the Hyksos dynasty, a Semitic people who ruled Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period.
