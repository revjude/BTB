Rosh \(or Rapha\) is mentioned in [[Gen.46.21|Genesis 46:21]] and [[1Chr.8.2|1 Chronicles 8:2]] as one of the sons of Benjamin, the youngest son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and Rachel. He is listed among the descendants of Jacob who went to Egypt during the time of Joseph \([[Gen.46.21|Genesis 46:21]]\). In the genealogy of the tribe of Benjamin in 1 Chronicles 8, Rosh \(or Rapha\) is mentioned again as a son of Benjamin \([[1Chr.8.2|1 Chronicles 8:2]]\). The name "Rosh" means "head" or "chief," while "Rapha" means "giant" or "mighty one." It is possible that these two names refer to the same individual, with "Rapha" being an alternate name or title. No further information is provided about Rosh \(or Rapha\) or his role within the tribe of Benjamin. His inclusion in the genealogies serves to document the family lines and descendants of Benjamin, whose tribe played a significant role in Israel's history, particularly during the reign of King Saul, who was from the tribe of Benjamin.
