Carkas was one of the seven eunuchs who served in the court of King Ahasuerus, also known as Xerxes, the Persian ruler \([[Esth.1.10|Esther 1:10]]\). Eunuchs were often employed in royal courts as trusted officials and servants due to their loyalty and inability to establish a rival dynasty. During a royal feast, when King Ahasuerus was in high spirits from drinking wine, he commanded the seven eunuchs, including Carkas, to bring Queen Vashti before him wearing her royal crown. The king wanted to display her beauty to the people and nobles, but Queen Vashti refused to come \(Esther 1:11-12\). This refusal led to the king's anger and ultimately to Vashti's removal as queen, setting the stage for the rise of Esther. Carkas' mention as one of the eunuchs highlights the opulence and power dynamics within the Persian court during the time of Esther.
