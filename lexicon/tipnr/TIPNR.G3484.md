Nain was a town in Galilee, mentioned in the New Testament as the place where Jesus raised a widow's son from the dead \([[Luke.7.11|Luke 7:11]]-17\). As Jesus approached the town gate, He encountered a funeral procession for the only son of a widow. Moved with compassion, Jesus touched the coffin and commanded the young man to arise, and he was restored to life. This miracle was witnessed by a large crowd and led many to recognize Jesus as a great prophet. The exact location of Nain is not certain, but it is believed to be the modern village of Nein, located about 9 miles southeast of Nazareth.
