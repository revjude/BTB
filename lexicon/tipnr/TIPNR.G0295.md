Amphipolis was a city in the region of Macedonia, located along the Strymon River, about 3 miles \(5 km\) from the Aegean Sea. It is mentioned in Acts 17:1 as one of the places Paul and Silas passed through on their way from Philippi to Thessalonica during Paul's second missionary journey. 

The city was an important military and economic center, situated on the main Roman road, the Via Egnatia, which connected the Adriatic Sea with the Hellespont. Amphipolis was originally an Athenian colony but later came under Macedonian and then Roman control. 

Although the Bible does not provide any details about Paul's activities in Amphipolis, the mention of the city in the context of his journey highlights the strategic importance of the Via Egnatia for the spread of the gospel in the region. The inclusion of Amphipolis in the itinerary demonstrates Paul's intentional efforts to reach major cities and transportation hubs with the message of Christ.
