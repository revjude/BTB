Myra was a city in Lycia, a region on the southern coast of Asia Minor \(modern Turkey\). It is mentioned in the New Testament only once, in the account of Paul's journey to Rome as a prisoner \(Acts 27:5\). Paul and his companions, under the custody of a centurion named Julius, sailed from Caesarea to Sidon, then to Myra. At Myra, they boarded an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy. Myra was a major port city in ancient times, known for its trade and commerce.
