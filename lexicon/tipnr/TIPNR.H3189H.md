- only referred to as Jahath **<big>[[H3189|יַחַת]]</big>**;

Jahath is mentioned in [[1Chr.23.10|1 Chronicles 23:10]]-11 as a Levite, a descendant of Shimei, and a grandson of Gershon. This passage is part of a larger section that describes the organization of the Levites during the reign of King David. 

The Levites were one of the twelve tribes of Israel, set apart for religious duties and the service of the tabernacle and later the temple. Gershon was one of the three main divisions of the Levites, along with Kohath and Merari \(1Ch.23.6\). 

In this context, Jahath is listed as one of the sons of Shimei, who was a son of Laadan, a descendant of Gershon \(1Ch.23.7-9\). The text notes that Shimei had four sons, including Jahath, but that they were considered as one family because they had fewer sons compared to other Levite families \([[1Chr.23.11|1Ch.23.11]]\). 

No other specific details are provided about Jahath's life, role, or responsibilities as a Levite. His inclusion in this genealogical record, however, highlights the importance of the Levitical lineage and the organization of the Levites for their service in the temple during the time of David.
