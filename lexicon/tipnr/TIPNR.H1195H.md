Baana son of Hushai was another of the twelve district governors who served under King Solomon. He is mentioned in [[1Kgs.4.16|1 Kings 4:16]] as being in charge of the territory of Asher and Aloth. Like the other governors, Baana would have had administrative duties in his district, ensuring the smooth running of local affairs and the collection of resources for the king. The fact that he was the son of Hushai suggests he may have been from a prominent family, as Hushai was a close advisor to King David. Baana's role as a governor reflects the organized structure of Solomon's kingdom and the king's delegation of authority to trusted officials.
