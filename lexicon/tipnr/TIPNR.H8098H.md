Shemaiah was a Levite who served as a scribe during the reign of King David. In [[1Chr.24.6|1 Chronicles 24:6]], he is described as the son of Nethanel, a Levite. When David organized the divisions of the priests for their service in the temple, Shemaiah was the scribe who recorded the allotment of duties. He worked alongside Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers' houses of the priests and Levites. Shemaiah's role as a scribe demonstrates the importance of accurate record-keeping in the administration of the temple services.
