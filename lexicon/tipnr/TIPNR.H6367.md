Pi-hahiroth, also known as Hahiroth, was a place mentioned in the account of the Israelites' Exodus from Egypt. After leaving Succoth, the Israelites were instructed by God to turn back and camp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, opposite Baal-zephon \(Exod. 14:2\). The Egyptians, led by Pharaoh, pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they were camped by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, opposite Baal-zephon \(Exod. 14:9\). It was at this location that God instructed Moses to stretch out his hand over the sea, causing the waters to divide and allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground \(Exod. 14:15-16, 21-22\). The Egyptians pursued them into the sea, but God brought the waters back upon them, drowning Pharaoh's entire army \(Exod. 14:23-28\). The Israelites' journey from Pi-hahiroth is also mentioned in the list of their encampments in [[Num.33.7|Numbers 33:7]]-8. The exact location of Pi-hahiroth is uncertain, but it was evidently near the Red Sea, and its mention in the Exodus narrative highlights God's power and deliverance on behalf of His people.
