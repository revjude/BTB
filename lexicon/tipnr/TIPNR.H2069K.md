Zebadiah, the son of Asahel, was a commander in King David's army. He was in charge of the fourth division, which served during the fourth month of the year. Asahel, Zebadiah's father, was the brother of Joab, who was the commander of David's entire army. The fact that Zebadiah held this position suggests that he was a capable military leader. His division consisted of 24,000 men, indicating the significant size of David's military force. The rotation of army divisions allowed for a well-organized and efficient military structure during David's reign.
