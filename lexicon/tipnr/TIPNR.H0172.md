Oholibah is a symbolic name used by the prophet Ezekiel to represent Jerusalem, the capital of the southern kingdom of Judah \(Ezekiel 23:4\). In Ezekiel's allegorical prophecy, Oholibah and her sister Oholah \(representing Samaria\) are portrayed as promiscuous women who engaged in idolatry and sought alliances with foreign nations \([[Ezek.23.11|Ezekiel 23:11]]-44\). The name Oholibah likely means "my tent is in her," possibly referring to the presence of the temple and God's dwelling place in Jerusalem. Through this allegory, Ezekiel condemns the unfaithfulness of Judah, highlighting their spiritual adultery and the consequences they would face as a result of their actions, including judgment and destruction by the hands of their former lovers \([[Ezek.23.22|Ezekiel 23:22]]-35\).
