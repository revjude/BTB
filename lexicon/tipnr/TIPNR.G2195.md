<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Zacchaeus</span>, a wealthy tax collector, hosted Jesus in his home and experienced a transformative encounter.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Luke.19.2|Luk.19.2]]; 
- only referred to as Zacchaeus<[[G2195]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ζακχαῖος</span>\).

Zacchaeus was a chief tax collector in the city of Jericho. He was a wealthy man, likely due to his profession, which was often associated with corruption and extortion in ancient Roman-occupied Israel. When Jesus passed through Jericho, Zacchaeus sought to see him but was hindered by his short stature and the crowd. He climbed a sycamore tree to catch a glimpse of Jesus. Noticing Zacchaeus, Jesus called him down and declared his intention to stay at his house. This encounter led to a profound change in Zacchaeus, who pledged to give half of his possessions to the poor and to repay fourfold anyone he had cheated. Jesus affirmed Zacchaeus's transformation, declaring that salvation had come to his house and that the Son of Man had come to seek and save the lost.
