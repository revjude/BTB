Hiram, also known as Huram or Huram-abi, was a highly skilled craftsman from Tyre who was commissioned by King Solomon to create the bronze furnishings for the First Temple in Jerusalem. He is mentioned in 1 Kings 7 and 2 Chronicles 2 and 4. 

Hiram was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a craftsman from Tyre \(1 Kings 7:14; 2 Chronicles 2:14\). He was renowned for his expertise in working with bronze, as well as his skill in engraving, designing, and executing various artistic works. 

King Solomon requested that Hiram, the king of Tyre, send him this skilled craftsman to assist in the construction of the temple \([[2Chr.2.13|2 Chronicles 2:13]]-14\). Hiram the craftsman was then sent to Jerusalem, where he created the bronze pillars, the bronze Sea \(a large basin\), the bronze stands, and various other bronze furnishings for the temple \(1 Kings 7:15-45; 2 Chronicles 4:11-16\). 

The detailed descriptions of Hiram's work in the biblical text underscore the importance and magnificence of the temple furnishings. His contributions were integral to the beauty and functionality of the temple, and his skill and artistry were highly valued by both Solomon and the people of Israel.
