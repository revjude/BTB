A group in the Old Testament

The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Cherethite</span>s were a Philistine tribe that served as royal guards for Israelite kings. \([[2Sam.8.18|2Sa.8.18]]; 15.18; 20.7; [[1Kgs.1.38|1Ki.1.38]],44; [[1Chr.18.17|1Ch.18.17]]; Ki.11.4; [[2Kgs.11.19|2Ki.11.19]]; [[2Sam.20.23|2Sa.20.23]]\)
- A group, first mentioned at [[2Sam.8.18|2Sa.8.18]]; 
- referred to as Cherethite **<big>[[H3774|כְּרֵתִי]]</big>**, or Carite or Cherethite \(=Qere. Ketiv= Carian, NIV= Kerethite\)  **<big>[[H3746|כָּרִי]]</big>**.

The Cherethites, along with the Pelethites, were a group of Philistine warriors who served as loyal guards and soldiers for Israelite kings, particularly during the reigns of David and Solomon. They are mentioned multiple times in the books of Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles. 

During David's reign, the Cherethites and Pelethites were part of his royal bodyguard and army \([[2Sam.8.18|2 Samuel 8:18]]; 15:18; 20:7, 23\). They remained loyal to David during Absalom's rebellion \([[2Sam.15.18|2 Samuel 15:18]]\) and helped suppress the revolt led by Sheba \([[2Sam.20.7|2 Samuel 20:7]]\). 

When Solomon ascended to the throne, the Cherethites and Pelethites supported him and played a role in securing his kingship against Adonijah's attempted coup \([[1Kgs.1.38|1 Kings 1:38]], 44\). They continued to serve in the royal guard during Solomon's reign \(1 Kings 11:4; [[2Kgs.11.19|2 Kings 11:19]]\). 

The Cherethites' consistent loyalty and military support for the Davidic kings suggest that they were a trusted and elite group of warriors, likely drawn from the Philistine tribe of the same name.
