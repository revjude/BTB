Anaharath is mentioned in [[Josh.19.19|Joshua 19:19]] as one of the towns on the border of the territory allotted to the tribe of Issachar. It is listed along with other towns such as Jezreel, Chesulloth, and Shunem, indicating its location in the Jezreel Valley, a fertile region in northern Israel. 

The exact site of Anaharath is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the eastern part of the Jezreel Valley, near the border with the tribe of Naphtali. Some scholars propose identifying Anaharath with the modern village of en-Na'ura, approximately 5 miles \(8 km\) northeast of Megiddo. 

Apart from its mention in the list of Issachar's border towns, no other information about Anaharath is provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in the description of the tribal allotments suggests that it was a recognized landmark or settlement during the distribution of the land under Joshua's leadership.
