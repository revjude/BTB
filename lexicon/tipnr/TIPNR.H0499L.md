Eleazar is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.25|Ezra 10:25]] as one of the descendants of Parosh who had married foreign women. During the time of Ezra, many Israelites, including priests and Levites, had intermarried with the pagan inhabitants of the land. Ezra called for a reform, urging those who had married foreign wives to separate from them. Eleazar was among those who agreed to put away their foreign wives and children, demonstrating repentance and obedience to God's law.
