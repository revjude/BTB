Sachar is mentioned in [[1Chr.26.4|1 Chronicles 26:4]] as one of the sons of Obed-edom, a Levite who served as a gatekeeper in the tabernacle during the reign of King David. Obed-edom was entrusted with the care of the Ark of the Covenant for three months after the incident involving Uzzah \(2 Samuel 6:10-11; 1 Chronicles 13:13-14\). As a result of God's blessing upon Obed-edom's household during this time, David appointed him and his sons as gatekeepers in the tabernacle \(1 Chronicles 15:18, 24\). Sachar is listed among Obed-edom's eight sons, who are described as "able men with strength for the service" \(1 Chronicles 26:8\). The gatekeepers were responsible for guarding the entrances to the tabernacle, maintaining order, and ensuring that only authorized individuals entered the sacred spaces \(1 Chronicles 9:22-27\). The mention of Sachar and his brothers highlights the importance of the Levites' role in the worship and service of the Lord, as well as the faithfulness of Obed-edom's family in carrying out their assigned duties.
