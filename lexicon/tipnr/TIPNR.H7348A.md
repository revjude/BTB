Rehum, also known as Harim or Nehum, is mentioned in the lists of leaders who returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel after the Babylonian exile \([[Ezra.2.2|Ezra 2:2]]; [[Neh.7.7|Nehemiah 7:7]]; 12:3\). Following the decree of King Cyrus of Persia, which allowed the Jews to return to their homeland and rebuild the temple \(Ezra 1:1-4\), a group of exiles led by Zerubbabel made the journey back to Jerusalem. Rehum \(Harim or Nehum\) is listed among the leaders of this group, along with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and others. The returning exiles faced the challenge of rebuilding the temple and reestablishing Jewish worship in Jerusalem. In the book of Nehemiah, Rehum \(Harim\) is also mentioned as one of the priests who sealed the covenant to follow God's law \([[Neh.10.5|Nehemiah 10:5]]\). The mention of Rehum \(Harim or Nehum\) in these passages highlights the significant role played by various leaders and priests in the restoration of Jewish life and faith after the exile.
