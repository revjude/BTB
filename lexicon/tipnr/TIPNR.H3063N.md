Judea, also known as Judah, was the southern region of ancient Israel, located between Samaria to the north and Idumea to the south. The area was named after the tribe of Judah, which settled there after the Israelites conquered Canaan. Judea was known for its hilly terrain and its capital, Jerusalem, which served as the religious and political center of the Jewish people. The region played a significant role throughout biblical history, from the time of the judges to the New Testament era. Many important events took place in Judea, including the reigns of King David and King Solomon, the construction of the First and Second Temples in Jerusalem, and the ministries of Jesus and the early church. Judea was the birthplace of John the Baptist \([[Luke.1.5|Luke 1:5]], 65\) and Jesus \([[Matt.2.1|Matthew 2:1]], 5\). During the New Testament period, Judea was a Roman province, and it was the scene of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection \([[Luke.23.5|Luke 23:5]]; John 19:19-20\). The early Christian church began in Jerusalem and spread throughout Judea \(Acts 1:8; 2:9\). The region's history, culture, and religious significance made it a central focus of both the Old and New Testaments.
