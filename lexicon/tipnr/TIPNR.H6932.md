Kedemoth was a town located in the land of Moab, east of the Jordan River. It is first mentioned in Deuteronomy 2:26, where Moses sent messengers from Kedemoth to Sihon, king of the Amorites, requesting passage through his land. After the conquest of Canaan, Kedemoth was allotted to the tribe of Reuben \([[Josh.13.18|Joshua 13:18]]\) and later designated as a Levitical city for the Merarite clan \([[Josh.21.37|Joshua 21:37]]; [[1Chr.6.79|1 Chronicles 6:79]]\). The Levites were distributed among the various tribes and given cities to dwell in, where they could fulfill their religious duties. The exact location of Kedemoth is unknown, but it was likely situated in the plateau region east of the Dead Sea.
