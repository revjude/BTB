- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.12.13|Neh.12.13]]; 
- only referred to as Meshullam **<big>[[H4918|מְשֻׁלָּם]]</big>**.

Meshullam is mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as one of the priests who served during the high priesthood of Joiakim \([[Neh.12.13|Neh.12.13]]\). Joiakim was the son of Jeshua, the high priest who had returned from the Babylonian exile with Zerubbabel. In the list of priests and Levites who served during this time, Meshullam is named as the head of the priestly family of Ezra. This suggests that Meshullam was a prominent figure within the priesthood and had a leadership role in his family's priestly duties.
