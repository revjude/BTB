Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Luke</span>, a physician and companion of Paul, was the author of the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts \([[Col.4.14|Col.4.14]]; [[2Tim.4.11|2Ti.4.11]]; [[Phlm.1.24|Phm.1.24]]\).
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[2Cor.13.14|2Co.13.14]]; 
- only referred to as Luke **<big>[[G3065|Λουκᾶς]]</big>**.

Luke was a physician \([[Col.4.14|Col.4.14]]\) and a close companion of the apostle Paul \([[2Tim.4.11|2Ti.4.11]]; [[Phlm.1.24|Phm.1.24]]\). He is best known as the author of the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts. Although not mentioned by name in these books, early church tradition unanimously attributes them to Luke. His writings suggest that he was well-educated and had a keen eye for historical detail. Luke accompanied Paul on several missionary journeys, as evidenced by the "we" passages in Acts \(Act.16.10-17; 20.5-21.18; 27.1-28.16\). He remained with Paul during his imprisonment in Rome \([[2Tim.4.11|2Ti.4.11]]\). In Paul's letters, Luke is described as a beloved friend and fellow worker in the gospel \([[Col.4.14|Col.4.14]]; [[Phlm.1.24|Phm.1.24]]\). His medical background may have been helpful during Paul's travels and ministry. Luke's Gospel emphasizes the humanity of Jesus, His compassion for the marginalized, and the universal scope of His message. The Book of Acts records the growth of the early church and the spread of the gospel from Jerusalem to Rome.
