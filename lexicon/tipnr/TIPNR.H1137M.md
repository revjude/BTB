Bani, also known as Binnui, was a Levite who played a significant role in the spiritual renewal of Israel during the time of Nehemiah. In [[Neh.8.7|Nehemiah 8:7]], Bani is listed among the Levites who helped explain the Law to the people as Ezra read it aloud. This teaching ministry was crucial for the people to understand and apply God's Word. Later, in Nehemiah 9:4-5, Bani is one of the Levites who led the people in a prayer of confession and worship. He stood on the stairs with other Levites and cried out to God, acknowledging the nation's sins and God's faithfulness. Bani is also mentioned in [[Neh.10.9|Nehemiah 10:9]] as one of the Levites who signed the covenant to obey God's law. In [[Neh.12.8|Nehemiah 12:8]], he is listed among the Levites who participated in the dedication of the wall. These references highlight Bani's involvement in various aspects of spiritual leadership, including teaching, prayer, and covenant renewal.
