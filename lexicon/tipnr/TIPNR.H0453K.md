Elihu is a character in the Book of Job who speaks to Job and his three friends after they had finished their dialogue \(Job.32-37\). He is described as a young man from the family of Ram, and he became angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God and with Job's friends for not finding an answer to Job's complaints \([[Job.32.2|Job.32.2]]-3\). Elihu waited to speak until after the older men had finished, showing respect for their age \([[Job.32.4|Job.32.4]]-6\). In his speeches, Elihu emphasizes God's justice, sovereignty, and wisdom, arguing that God uses suffering to discipline and purify people \(Job.33-37\). He also asserts that God is greater than human understanding and that people should submit to His will \(Job.36-37\). After Elihu's speech, God Himself addresses Job out of the whirlwind \(Job.38.1\). The Bible does not provide any further information about Elihu's life or background.
