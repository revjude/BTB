The Valley of Zeboim is mentioned in [[1Sam.13.18|1 Samuel 13:18]] as one of the destinations of the Philistine raiding parties sent out from their camp at Michmash during the reign of King Saul. The passage describes three groups of raiders: one turned toward Ophrah in the land of Shual, another toward Beth-horon, and the third toward the border overlooking the Valley of Zeboim facing the wilderness. The exact location of the Valley of Zeboim is uncertain, but based on the context, it is believed to have been situated somewhere east of Michmash, possibly in the wilderness region near the Dead Sea. The name "Zeboim" may be related to the ancient city of Zeboiim, one of the cities of the plain destroyed along with Sodom and Gomorrah, although a direct connection is not certain. The mention of the Valley of Zeboim in this passage provides insight into the geography of the region and the military activities of the Philistines during Saul's reign, as they sought to assert their control over the territory of Israel.
