- A man from the tribe of Benjamin living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at 1Ch.8.36; 
- only referred to as Zimri **<big>[[H2174|זִמְרִי]]</big>**; 
-  son of Jehoaddah **<big>[[H3085|יְהוֹעַדָּה]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Alemeth **<big>[[H5964|עָלֶמֶת]]</big>** and Azmaveth **<big>[[H5820|עַזְמָוֶת]]</big>**;

Zimri was a member of the tribe of Benjamin mentioned in the genealogies found in 1 Chronicles 8 and 9. He was the son of Jehoadah and is listed among the descendants of Saul, the first king of Israel. The genealogies in these chapters trace the lineage of several prominent Benjamite families, particularly those who lived in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. The repetition of Zimri's name in both genealogies suggests that he was a significant figure within the tribe of Benjamin. However, no additional information is provided about his life or role within the tribe. The inclusion of Zimri in the genealogical records demonstrates the importance of preserving family lineages and the connection of the Benjamites to their royal heritage through Saul's line.
