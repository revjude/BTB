Ahitub is mentioned as the father of Zadok, one of the prominent priests who served during the reign of King David. Zadok, along with Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, is listed among David's chief officials. \([[2Sam.8.17|2Sa.8.17]]; [[1Chr.18.16|1Ch.18.16]]\) 

In the genealogy of the Levites, specifically the line of Eleazar, Ahitub is listed as the son of Amariah and the father of Zadok. \([[1Chr.6.7|1Ch.6.7]],8,52\) This genealogy establishes Zadok's priestly lineage and his rightful place in the service of the tabernacle and, later, the temple. 

Zadok played a significant role in David's reign, remaining loyal to him during Absalom's rebellion. \(2Sa.15.24-29\) He also supported Solomon's claim to the throne and anointed him as king. \(1Ki.1.32-40\) 

Although little is recorded about Ahitub himself, his importance lies in his position as the father of Zadok, ensuring the continuity of the priestly line and the faithful service of his son during a crucial period in Israel's history.
