Zebadiah is mentioned as the firstborn son of Meshelemiah, a Korahite who served as a gatekeeper in the time of King David. The Korahites were a Levitical family assigned to various duties in the tabernacle and later in the temple. Meshelemiah and his sons, including Zebadiah, were responsible for guarding the gates and entrances to the sacred areas. Being the firstborn son, Zebadiah would have held a position of responsibility and leadership among his brothers in their role as gatekeepers.
