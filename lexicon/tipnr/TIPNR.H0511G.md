Elkanah is mentioned in the genealogies of the Levites as a descendant of Korah, the son of Izhar \([[Exod.6.24|Exo.6.24]]; [[1Chr.6.23|1Ch.6.23]]\). He was part of the Kohathite clan, one of the three main divisions of the Levites. The Kohathites were responsible for carrying and maintaining the sacred objects of the tabernacle during the wilderness journey. Elkanah's specific role within the Kohathite clan is not elaborated upon in the Bible. His mention in the genealogical records serves to establish the lineage of the Levites and their duties in the tabernacle service.
