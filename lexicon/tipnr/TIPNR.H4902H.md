Meshech was a nation descended from Japheth, one of the sons of Noah \(Genesis 10:2\). In the Bible, Meshech is often mentioned together with Tubal, suggesting a close association between the two peoples. Meshech and Tubal are described as trading partners of Tyre, supplying the city with slaves and bronze vessels \([[Ezek.27.13|Ezekiel 27:13]]\). The two nations are also mentioned as allies of Gog, the chief prince of Magog, in the prophecy of Ezekiel concerning the future invasion of Israel \([[Ezek.38.2|Ezekiel 38:2]], 3; 39:1\). The psalmist laments living among the tents of Meshech, using it as a metaphor for dwelling among hostile and barbaric people \(Psalm 120:5\). Historically, Meshech is identified with the Mushki or Muski, an ancient people who lived in the region of Cappadocia in Asia Minor.
