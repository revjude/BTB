Raamses, also known as Rameses, was one of the store cities built by the Israelites during their time of slavery in Egypt \(Exod. 1:11\). The Egyptians appointed taskmasters over the Israelites to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Raamses as store cities for Pharaoh. The construction of these cities was part of the Egyptians' plan to subdue the growing Israelite population and prevent them from joining forces with Egypt's enemies in case of war \(Exod. 1:9-10\). The exact location of Raamses is debated, but it is generally associated with the city of Pi-Ramesses \(House of Ramesses\), the capital of Egypt during the reign of Pharaoh Ramesses II in the 13th century BC. Pi-Ramesses was located in the eastern Nile Delta, near the modern-day city of Qantir. The name "Raamses" is thought to be derived from the name of Pharaoh Ramesses II, who was known for his extensive building projects. The mention of Raamses in the book of Exodus serves to illustrate the harsh conditions and oppression experienced by the Israelites in Egypt, setting the stage for God's miraculous deliverance of His people.
