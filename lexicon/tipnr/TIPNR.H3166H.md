- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.16.6|1Ch.16.6]]; 
- only referred to as Jahaziel **<big>[[H3166|יַחֲזִיאֵל]]</big>**.

Jahaziel is mentioned in [[1Chr.16.6|1 Chronicles 16:6]] as one of the Levite priests who were appointed to play the trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant. This chapter describes the events surrounding the bringing of the ark to Jerusalem and the organization of the Levites for worship and service. 

After the ark was successfully brought to Jerusalem and placed in the tent that David had pitched for it \(1Ch.16.1\), David appointed various Levites to minister before the ark with music and praise. Among these Levites were Jahaziel and Benaiah, who were specifically tasked with blowing the trumpets regularly before the ark \([[1Chr.16.6|1Ch.16.6]]\). 

The blowing of trumpets was an important part of Israelite worship, often used to signal important events, call the people to attention, or express praise and joy \(Nu.10.1-10\). The fact that Jahaziel and Benaiah were appointed to this role highlights the significance of the trumpet in the worship services before the ark. 

As Levite priests, Jahaziel and Benaiah would have been from the tribe of Levi, which was set apart for religious duties and service in the tabernacle and later the temple. Their appointment to this specific role demonstrates the organization and structure of the Levites in their various responsibilities related to worship. 

No other specific details are provided about Jahaziel's life, family, or other duties. His mention in this context, however, underscores the importance of music and the specific roles assigned to the Levites in the worship services before the ark during the time of David.
