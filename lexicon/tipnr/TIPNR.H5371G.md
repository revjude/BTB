Babylonian living at the time of Divided Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Nergal-sar-ezer</span> the Rab-mag was a Babylonian official present at the capture of Jerusalem in 587 BC.
- A Babylonian official of Samgar, living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at Jer.39.3a; 
- only referred to as Nergal-sar-ezer **<big>[[H5371|נֵרְגַּל שַׁרְאֶצֶר]]</big>**.

Nergal-sar-ezer , the Rag-mag \(a title for an officer\) is named among the Babylonian officials who entered Jerusalem after the Babylonians breached the city walls in 587 BC \(Jeremiah 39:3\). The name Nergal-sar-ezer means "Nergal, protect the king!" Nergal was the Babylonian god of war and pestilence. No title or specific role is given for this official. He may have been a military officer or government representative sent by King Nebuchadnezzar. This Nergal-sar-ezer is likely the same individual mentioned later in the same chapter \([[Jer.39.13|Jeremiah 39:13]]\), who also has the title Rab-mag.
