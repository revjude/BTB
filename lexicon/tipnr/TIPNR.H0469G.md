Elizaphan was a Levite leader from the clan of Kohath \([[Num.3.30|Num.3.30]]\). He was the son of Uzziel, who was the brother of Amram, the father of Moses and Aaron \([[Exod.6.22|Exo.6.22]]\). Elizaphan and his brother Mishael were instructed by Moses to carry the bodies of Nadab and Abihu, Aaron's sons who were killed for offering unauthorized fire before the Lord \([[Lev.10.4|Lev.10.4]]\). During the time of King David, Elizaphan's descendants, Shemaiah and his sons, were among the Levites appointed to carry the ark of the covenant \([[1Chr.15.8|1Ch.15.8]]\). Later, during the reign of King Hezekiah, a descendant of Elizaphan named Shimri is mentioned as one of the Levites who helped cleanse and consecrate the temple \([[2Chr.29.13|2Ch.29.13]]\). The Bible portrays Elizaphan and his descendants as having significant roles in the tabernacle and temple service throughout Israel's history.
