- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[2Tim.4.19|Act.6.5]]; 
- only referred to as Prochorus **<big>[[G4402|Πρόχορος]]</big>**.

Prochorus was one of the seven men chosen by the early church in Jerusalem to serve as deacons, as recorded in Acts 6:5. The need for these seven men arose when the Greek-speaking Jewish Christians complained that their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of food \(Acts 6:1\). To address this issue, the apostles instructed the church to select seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, to oversee this task \(Acts 6:2-3\). Prochorus was among those chosen, along with Stephen, Philip, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas. The apostles prayed and laid their hands on these seven men, appointing them to this ministry \(Acts 6:6\). The selection of these deacons allowed the apostles to focus on prayer and the ministry of the word, while ensuring that the practical needs of the community were met. Beyond this initial mention, no further details are provided about Prochorus' specific activities or his later life and ministry.
