Menuhoth is mentioned in the genealogy of the tribe of Judah, specifically in the lineage of Caleb, the son of Hur \([[1Chr.2.52|1Ch.2.52]]\). The text states that Caleb's sons included the clans of Ithrites, Puthites, Shumathites, and Mishraites, and that from these clans came the people of Zorah and Eshtaol. Menuhoth is listed among these clans, suggesting that they were a family group descended from Caleb.
