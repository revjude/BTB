Shallum, mentioned in [[2Chr.28.12|2 Chronicles 28:12]], was one of the leaders from the tribe of Ephraim who opposed the army of Israel taking captives from Judah during the reign of King Ahaz. When the army of Israel, led by King Pekah, attacked Judah and captured a large number of people, intending to bring them back to Samaria as slaves, Shallum and other leaders confronted them. They rebuked the army, reminding them of their own sins against the Lord and warning them not to add to their guilt by enslaving their fellow Israelites. As a result of their intervention, the captives were released, and the leaders of Ephraim provided them with clothing, food, and medical care before sending them back to Judah. Shallum's actions, along with those of the other leaders, demonstrated a sense of unity and compassion among the tribes of Israel, even during a time of conflict and division.
