Nebo is mentioned as a town in Judah whose inhabitants returned from the Babylonian exile \([[Ezra.2.29|Ezra 2:29]]; Neh. 7:33\). Some of its inhabitants are also listed among those who married foreign women during the time of Ezra \([[Ezra.10.43|Ezra 10:43]]\). It is possible that the town was named after an individual named Nebo, but no further information is provided in the Bible. The exact location of this town is unknown.
