He was a high priest who served during the time of the kings of Judah. Shallum was the son of Zadok, who was also a high priest, and the father of Hilkiah, who would later discover the Book of the Law during the reign of King Josiah. The genealogical records in these passages trace the lineage of the high priests, highlighting the importance of the priestly line. Shallum's inclusion in these lists emphasizes his significant role as a high priest and his place in the succession of religious leadership. The interchangeable use of the names Shallum and Meshullam suggests that he may have been known by both names.
