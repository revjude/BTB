Ish-bosheth, also known as Eshbaal, was the fourth son of King Saul \([[1Chr.8.33|1Ch.8.33]], 9.39\). After Saul's death, Abner, the commander of Saul's army, took Ish-bosheth and made him king over Israel, while David reigned over Judah \([[2Sam.2.8|2Sa.2.8]]-10\). Ish-bosheth was forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for two years. 

During his reign, there was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David \(2Sa.3.1\). Abner became angry with Ish-bosheth and defected to David \([[2Sam.3.8|2Sa.3.8]]-21\). Later, two of Ish-bosheth's captains, Rechab and Baanah, assassinated him while he was resting in his bed. They brought his head to David, hoping for a reward, but David had them executed for their crime \([[2Sam.4.5|2Sa.4.5]]-12\). 

After Ish-bosheth's death, all the tribes of Israel came to David and acknowledged him as king over all Israel \(2Sa.5.1-3\). The name "Ish-bosheth" means "man of shame," while "Eshbaal" means "man of Baal." The name change may reflect the biblical writer's perspective on the contrast between Ish-bosheth's weak rule and David's divinely appointed kingship.
