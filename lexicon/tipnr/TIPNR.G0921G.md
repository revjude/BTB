Barnabas, whose original name was Joseph or Joses, was a prominent figure in the early Christian church. He was a Levite from the island of Cyprus \(Acts 4:36\) who sold his land and brought the money to the apostles, demonstrating his generosity and commitment to the faith. Barnabas played a crucial role in introducing the newly converted Paul to the apostles in Jerusalem, vouching for his sincerity \(Acts 9:27\). The church in Jerusalem later sent Barnabas to Antioch, where he encouraged the believers and brought Paul to minister there \(Acts 11:22-26\). Barnabas and Paul were then commissioned by the Holy Spirit to embark on a missionary journey \(Acts 13:2\), during which they preached the gospel and established churches in various cities. Barnabas was also involved in the dispute concerning the acceptance of Gentile believers and accompanied Paul to the Jerusalem Council \(Acts 15\). He later separated from Paul due to a disagreement over taking Mark on another journey \(Acts 15:36-39\). Barnabas continued his ministry with Mark, while Paul chose Silas as his new companion. In the New Testament epistles, Barnabas is mentioned as a fellow laborer and an example of one who worked for the gospel without relying on financial support from the churches \([[1Cor.9.6|1 Corinthians 9:6]]\). He was recognized as a pillar of the church alongside James and Peter \([[Gal.2.9|Galatians 2:9]]\). Barnabas' ministry was characterized by encouragement, generosity, and a commitment to spreading the gospel message.
