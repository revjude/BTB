Azriel, the son of Jeremoth, is mentioned in [[1Chr.27.19|1 Chronicles 27:19]] as the ruler of the tribe of Naphtali during the reign of King David. This chapter lists the leaders of each tribe who were responsible for overseeing their respective tribes in various administrative and military matters. Azriel's position as the ruler of Naphtali suggests that he was a trusted and capable leader who had earned the confidence of King David. The tribe of Naphtali was located in the northern part of Israel, and its leaders would have been responsible for governing the people, maintaining order, and organizing the tribe's military forces when necessary. The mention of Azriel and the other tribal leaders demonstrates the importance of effective leadership and organization in the administration of David's kingdom.
