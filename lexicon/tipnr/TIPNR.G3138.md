Mark, also known as John Mark, was a prominent figure in the early Christian church. He was the son of Mary, whose house in Jerusalem served as a meeting place for the believers \(Acts 12:12\). Mark was also the cousin of Barnabas \([[Col.4.10|Colossians 4:10]]\) and accompanied Paul and Barnabas on their first missionary journey \(Acts 12:25; 13:5\). However, he left them at Perga and returned to Jerusalem \(Acts 13:13\), which later caused a disagreement between Paul and Barnabas \(Acts 15:37-39\). Despite this, Mark remained active in ministry, as evidenced by Paul's later references to him as a fellow worker \([[Phlm.1.24|Philemon 1:24]]; [[2Tim.4.11|2 Timothy 4:11]]\). He also worked closely with Peter, who referred to him as "my son Mark" \([[1Pet.5.13|1 Peter 5:13]]\). Tradition holds that Mark wrote the Gospel that bears his name based on Peter's teachings, making it one of the earliest written accounts of Jesus' life and ministry.
