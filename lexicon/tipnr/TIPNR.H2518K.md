- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.8.4|Neh.8.4]]; 
- only referred to as Hilkiah **<big>[[H2518|חִלְקִיָּה]]</big>**.

Hilkiah is mentioned in [[Neh.8.4|Nehemiah 8:4]] as one of the priests who stood beside Ezra the scribe when he read the Book of the Law to the assembled people of Israel. This event took place during the Feast of Tabernacles, after the Israelites had returned from Babylonian exile and rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem. 

Hilkiah, along with several other priests, stood on a wooden platform beside Ezra as he read from the Law from early morning until midday. The presence of the priests alongside Ezra emphasizes the importance and solemnity of the occasion, as well as the role of the priests in teaching and interpreting the Law to the people. Hilkiah's participation in this significant event demonstrates his role as a priest and his involvement in the spiritual restoration of Israel after the exile.
