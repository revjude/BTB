Tibni is mentioned in [[1Kgs.16.21|1 Kings 16:21]]-22 as a rival to Omri for the throne of Israel. After King Zimri's death, the people of Israel were divided, with half following Tibni son of Ginath and the other half following Omri. The conflict between the two factions lasted for about four years, during which time Israel was effectively a divided kingdom. Eventually, Omri's supporters proved stronger, and Tibni died, allowing Omri to consolidate his power and establish a new dynasty that ruled the northern kingdom of Israel. No other details are provided about Tibni's background, his claim to the throne, or the circumstances of his death. His brief mention in the biblical narrative highlights the political instability and power struggles that characterized the period of the divided monarchy in Israel.
