Maher-shalal-hash-baz was the name given to the son of the prophet Isaiah. The name, which means "swift is booty, speedy is prey," was a prophetic message about the impending Assyrian invasion of Syria and Israel. God instructed Isaiah to write this name on a large scroll and have it witnessed by reliable people. When Isaiah's wife, the prophetess, conceived and gave birth to a son, God commanded Isaiah to name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz. The child's name was a sign that before he would be old enough to say "father" or "mother," the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria would be carried away by the king of Assyria \([[Isa.8.1|Isaiah 8:1]], 3\).
