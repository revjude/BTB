The Diviners' Oak was a tree located near the city of Shechem, mentioned in the story of Abimelech's rise to power \([[Judg.9.37|Judges 9:37]]\). It was likely a prominent tree used by pagan diviners for their occult practices. In the context of the story, Gaal, one of Abimelech's opponents, refers to the Diviners' Oak when warning of an approaching army. The mention of this tree suggests that pagan divination practices were still prevalent in the region during the time of the judges. The Diviners' Oak stands as a reminder of the Israelites' struggle to remain faithful to God in the face of surrounding pagan influences.
