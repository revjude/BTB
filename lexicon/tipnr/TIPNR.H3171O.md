Jehiel was a member of the clan of Elam who returned from the Babylonian exile. He was one of the men found guilty of marrying foreign women, which was a violation of the Mosaic Law. Ezra the priest confronted the returned exiles about this issue \([[Ezra.10.2|Ezr.10.2]]\). Jehiel is not mentioned again in the biblical record.
