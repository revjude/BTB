Shiphi is mentioned in [[1Chr.4.37|1 Chronicles 4:37]] as part of the genealogy of the tribe of Simeon. He is listed as a descendant of Ziza and is described as one of the Simeonites who lived during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. The passage suggests that Shiphi and his fellow Simeonites were involved in expanding their territory by conquering and settling in the region of Gedor, which was previously inhabited by the Hamites. This event likely took place during Hezekiah's reign, indicating that Shiphi was a contemporary of this king.
