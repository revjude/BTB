This Bethel was a town in the southern region of Judah, distinct from the more famous Bethel in the north where Jacob had his vision. It is listed among the cities allocated to the tribe of Simeon within Judah's territory \([[Josh.19.4|Joshua 19:4]]\). The same settlement appears in the genealogical records of [[1Chr.4.30|1 Chronicles 4:30]] as part of Simeon's territory. 

 The town gained some prominence during David's early career when he sent some of the spoils from his victory over the Amalekites to its elders \([[1Sam.30.27|1 Samuel 30:27]]\). This gesture was part of David's political strategy of building alliances with the towns of Judah. 

 Probably corresponds to the settlement called Bethuel in some passages, though its exact modern location remains uncertain. 

 Note: Care must be taken not to confuse this southern Bethel with the more prominent northern city of the same name where significant events in the lives of Abraham, Jacob, and Jeroboam took place. The references provided relate specifically to this southern settlement.
