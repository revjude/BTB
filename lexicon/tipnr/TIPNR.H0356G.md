Elon the Hittite is mentioned in Genesis as the father of Basemath, one of Esau's wives. Esau, the son of Isaac and Rebekah, married two Hittite women, Judith and Basemath, causing grief to his parents \([[Gen.26.34|Gen.26.34]]\). Basemath is specifically identified as the daughter of Elon the Hittite. The Hittites were a people group living in Canaan during the time of the patriarchs. Esau's marriage to Hittite women was seen as a departure from the custom of marrying within the family or tribe, as his parents had desired. In [[Gen.36.2|Genesis 36:2]], Basemath is again mentioned as one of Esau's wives, reaffirming her identity as the daughter of Elon the Hittite. No further information is provided about Elon's life, occupation, or role in the Hittite community. His mention in the text serves primarily to identify the background of one of Esau's wives and to highlight the cultural and familial tensions surrounding Esau's marriages.
