Shemaiah was a Levite who lived in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. He is mentioned in both [[1Chr.9.14|1 Chronicles 9:14]] and [[Neh.11.15|Nehemiah 11:15]] as one of the Levites who settled in Jerusalem. In the Chronicles passage, he is described as the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari. The Nehemiah passage identifies him as the son of Bunni. 

As a Levite, Shemaiah would have had duties related to the temple service and worship. The resettlement of the Levites in Jerusalem was an important step in reestablishing the religious life of the community after the exile. However, no specific details are given about Shemaiah's responsibilities or contributions in this regard.
