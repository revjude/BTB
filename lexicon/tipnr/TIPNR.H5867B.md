- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.7|Ezr.2.7]]; 
- referred to as Elam or Elam \(=Qere. Ketiv= Olam\)  **<big>[[H5867|עֵילָם]]</big>**.

Elam is mentioned in [[Ezra.2.7|Ezra 2:7]],31; 8:7; 10:26; and [[Neh.7.12|Nehemiah 7:12]],34 as the ancestor of a group of Jewish exiles who returned to Jerusalem from Babylon. In [[Ezra.2.7|Ezra 2:7]] and [[Neh.7.12|Nehemiah 7:12]], the descendants of Elam are listed among the exiles who returned with Zerubbabel. [[Ezra.8.7|Ezra 8:7]] records that some of the descendants of Elam also returned with Ezra. In [[Ezra.10.2|Ezra 10:2]],26, some of the descendants of Elam are mentioned among those who had married foreign women and pledged to put them away. The repeated mentions of Elam's descendants suggest they were a significant family group among the returning exiles.
