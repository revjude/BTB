Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Mispar</span>, also known as Mispereth, was among the first group of exiles who returned to Jerusalem from Babylon under the leadership of Zerubbabel.
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.2|Ezr.2.2]]; 
- referred to as Mispar **<big>[[H4558|מִסְפָּר]]</big>**, or Mispereth **<big>[[H4559|מִסְפֶּרֶת]]</big>**.

Mispar, also referred to as Mispereth, is mentioned in [[Ezra.2.2|Ezra 2:2]] and [[Neh.7.7|Nehemiah 7:7]] as one of the individuals who returned to Jerusalem from Babylonian captivity. He was part of the first group of exiles who made the journey back to their homeland under the leadership of Zerubbabel, following the decree of King Cyrus of Persia. 

The name Mispar appears in the list of returnees in Ezra, while in the parallel passage in Nehemiah, the name is recorded as Mispereth. This variation in spelling may be due to differences in pronunciation or transcription over time. 

Apart from being listed among the returnees, no further information is provided about Mispar's background, family, or specific role in the community. However, his presence on this list indicates that he was a part of the initial wave of Jewish exiles who took the opportunity to return to Jerusalem and rebuild their lives in their ancestral homeland. 

The return of Mispar and the others marked the beginning of a new era in Jewish history, as they sought to reestablish their identity, rebuild the Temple, and restore their religious and cultural practices in the face of numerous challenges. The inclusion of Mispar's name in these records serves as a testament to the resilience and faith of the Jewish people during this pivotal time in their history.
