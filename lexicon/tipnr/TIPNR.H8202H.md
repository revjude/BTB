- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Kgs.19.16|1Ki.19.16]]; 
- only referred to as Shaphat **<big>[[H8202|שָׁפָט]]</big>**; 
-  father of Elisha **<big>[[H0477|אֱלִישָׁע]]</big>**.

Shaphat, mentioned in [[1Kgs.19.16|1 Kings 19:16]],19 and [[2Kgs.3.11|2 Kings 3:11]], 6:31, was the father of Elisha, the prophet who succeeded Elijah. Shaphat was from Abel-meholah, a town in the Jordan Valley. When Elijah was instructed by God to anoint Elisha as his successor, he found Elisha plowing with twelve yoke of oxen, indicating that Shaphat's family was wealthy and had a large agricultural operation. Elisha's response to Elijah's call, slaughtering the oxen and using the equipment to cook a meal for the people, demonstrates his willingness to leave behind his former life and fully commit to his prophetic ministry. As a prophet, Elisha performed numerous miracles and played a significant role in the religious and political affairs of Israel during the reigns of kings Joram, Jehu, Jehoahaz, and Jehoash. The mention of Shaphat as Elisha's father highlights the family background of this important prophetic figure.
