Shual is mentioned in the context of the Philistine threat to Israel during the reign of King Saul \(1 Sam. 13:17\). After the Philistines assembled a large army at Michmash, they sent out raiding parties in three directions. One company turned toward Ophrah in the land of Shual, while the others went toward Beth-horon and the Valley of Zeboim. The exact location of Shual is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the territory of Benjamin, north of Jerusalem. The name "Shual" means "fox" or "jackal" in Hebrew, possibly indicating the presence of these animals in the region or reflecting the cunning nature of the Philistine raiders. The mention of Shual in this narrative highlights the ongoing conflict between the Israelites and the Philistines during Saul's reign and the challenges faced by the newly established monarchy. It also demonstrates the strategic importance of the region and the need for effective defense against enemy incursions.
