Naggai is a name that appears in the genealogy of Jesus Christ, as recorded in the Gospel of Luke \([[Luke.3.25|Luke 3:25]]\). He is listed as the son of Maath and the father of Esli, making him a distant ancestor of Jesus. 

The genealogy in Luke 3 traces Jesus' lineage back through His mother Mary's side of the family, going all the way back to Adam, the first man. This genealogy is distinct from the one found in the Gospel of Matthew, which follows Jesus' lineage through His earthly father Joseph's side of the family. 

The inclusion of Naggai in this genealogical record highlights the importance of family heritage and lineage in Jewish society. It also serves to emphasize Jesus' connection to the broader human family and His role as the Savior of all mankind.
