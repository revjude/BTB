The Kishon River is mentioned several times in the Bible, primarily in the context of military conflicts. It is located in northern Israel, near the city of Megiddo. In the time of Deborah and Barak, the Canaanite army led by Sisera was defeated near the Kishon River \([[Judg.4.7|Judges 4:7]], 13; 5:21\). The river is described as sweeping away the enemy forces. Later, during the reign of King Ahab, the prophet Elijah had the prophets of Baal slaughtered at the Kishon River after the contest on Mount Carmel \([[1Kgs.18.40|1 Kings 18:40]]\). The river is also mentioned in a prayer for God's intervention against Israel's enemies \(Psalm 83:9\).
