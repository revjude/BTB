Jehonathan is mentioned in [[2Chr.17.8|2 Chronicles 17:8]] as one of the Levites sent by King Jehoshaphat to teach the Book of the Law in the cities of Judah. This chapter describes Jehoshaphat's efforts to strengthen the spiritual foundation of his kingdom by sending out teachers to instruct the people in the ways of the Lord. Jehonathan is listed among the Levites who were chosen for this important task, along with Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, and Tobijah. The text does not provide any further details about Jehonathan's background or his specific role in the teaching mission. However, his inclusion in this list suggests that he was a trusted and knowledgeable Levite who was capable of communicating the principles of God's law to the people. The sending out of these teachers demonstrates Jehoshaphat's commitment to the spiritual well-being of his subjects and his desire to foster a deeper understanding of God's word throughout the kingdom.
