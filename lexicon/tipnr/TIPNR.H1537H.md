Gilgal, mentioned in 2 Kings, was a place associated with the prophets Elijah and Elisha. It was from Gilgal that Elijah set out on his final journey before being taken up to heaven in a whirlwind \([[2Kgs.2.1|2 Kings 2:1]]\). Elisha, who had been anointed as Elijah's successor, returned to Gilgal after Elijah's departure. Later, during a time of famine, Elisha was in Gilgal with a group of prophets known as the "sons of the prophets" \([[2Kgs.4.38|2 Kings 4:38]]\). While there, Elisha performed a miracle by making a poisonous stew edible, demonstrating his prophetic power and divine authority. This Gilgal seems to have been a location where a community of prophets lived and trained, possibly different from the Gilgal mentioned in the books of Joshua and Samuel. The exact location of this Gilgal is uncertain, but it was likely in the northern part of Israel, given its association with the prophetic ministries of Elijah and Elisha.
