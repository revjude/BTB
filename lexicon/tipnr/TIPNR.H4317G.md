- A man living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, only mentioned at [[Num.13.13|Num.13.13]];

Michael is mentioned in the book of Numbers as one of the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan \([[Num.13.13|Num.13.13]]\). He was chosen as the representative from the tribe of Asher. Along with the other spies, Michael was instructed to assess the land, its inhabitants, and its cities \(Num.13.17-20\). After forty days, the spies returned with their report, acknowledging the land's fruitfulness but emphasizing the strength of its inhabitants and fortified cities \(Num.13.25-29\). While Caleb and Joshua encouraged the people to trust in the Lord and take possession of the land, the other ten spies, including Michael, gave a discouraging report that instilled fear in the Israelites \(Num.13.30-33\). As a result, the people rebelled against Moses and the Lord, leading to a forty-year delay in entering the Promised Land \(Num.14\).
