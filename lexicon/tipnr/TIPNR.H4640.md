Maasai, also referred to as Amashsai, was a priest mentioned in the genealogies of the priestly families during and Nehemiah \([[1Chr.9.12|1Ch.9.12]]; [[Neh.11.13|Neh.11.13]]\). In the genealogy recorded in 1 Chronicles, Maasai is listed as a descendant of Adiel, who was a descendant of Immer, one of the priestly clans \([[1Chr.9.12|1Ch.9.12]]\). This suggests that Maasai belonged to the priestly lineage that  served in the temple during the reign of David. In the book of Nehemiah, Amashsai \(likely the same person as Maasai\) is mentioned as the son of Azarel and a leader among the priests who settled in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile \([[Neh.11.13|Neh.11.13]]\). The inclusion of Maasai/Amashsai in both the pre-exilic and post-exilic records highlights the continuity of the priestly families and their service in the temple.
