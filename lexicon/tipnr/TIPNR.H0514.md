Eltekeh, also spelled Elteke, was a city allotted to the tribe of Dan during the division of the Promised Land \([[Josh.19.44|Joshua 19:44]]\). It was one of the cities in the western foothills of Judah, near the border with the coastal plain. 

Later, Eltekeh was designated as one of the cities given to the Levites, specifically to the descendants of Kohath \([[Josh.21.23|Joshua 21:23]]\). The Levites, who were not given a specific territory, were distributed among the other tribes and given cities to live in, along with pasturelands for their flocks. 

Apart from its allocation to Dan and its designation as a Levitical city, no other events or details about Eltekeh are recorded in the Bible. Its exact location is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the Shephelah region, possibly near the Sorek Valley.
