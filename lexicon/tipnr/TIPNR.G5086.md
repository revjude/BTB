<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Tiberius</span> was the Roman emperor during Jesus' ministry and crucifixion, mentioned in several Gospel accounts.
- A Roman Emperor living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Matt.22.17|Mat.22.17]]; 
- referred to as Tiberius<[[G5086]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Τιβέριος</span>\), or Caesar<[[G2541J]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Καῖσαρ</span>\).

Tiberius, also referred to as Caesar, was the Roman emperor during the ministry and death of Jesus Christ. He is mentioned in several passages in the Gospels and once in the Book of Acts \([[Luke.3.1|Luke 3:1]]; [[Matt.22.17|Matthew 22:17]]-21; [[Mark.12.14|Mark 12:14]]-17; [[Luke.20.22|Luke 20:22]]-25; 23:2; John 19:12,15\). Tiberius ruled from 14 to 37 AD, succeeding Augustus. His reign provided the historical and political context for the events of the New Testament. In [[Luke.3.1|Luke 3:1]], Tiberius is mentioned to date the beginning of John the Baptist's ministry. The Gospels also record Jesus' response to the question of paying taxes to Caesar \(Tiberius\), affirming the legitimacy of secular authority while prioritizing obedience to God \([[Matt.22.17|Matthew 22:17]]-21; [[Mark.12.14|Mark 12:14]]-17; [[Luke.20.22|Luke 20:22]]-25\). During Jesus' trial, the Jewish leaders accused him of opposing payment of taxes to Caesar and claiming to be a king, which Pontius Pilate recognized as a challenge to Tiberius' authority \([[Luke.23.2|Luke 23:2]]; John 19:12,15\). Tiberius' reign was marked by growing unrest in Judea, leading to the appointment of Pontius Pilate as governor. The New Testament portrays Tiberius as the embodiment of secular power, contrasting with Jesus' spiritual authority.
