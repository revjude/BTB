Issachar was the ninth son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and the fifth son of Leah \(Gen. 30:18; 35:23; 46:13; 1 Chr. 2:1\). His name means "man of reward" or "there is reward", referring to Leah's belief that God rewarded her for giving her maidservant to Jacob \(Gen. 30:18\). 

Issachar had four sons: Tola, Puvah, Job \(or Jashub\), and Shimron \(Gen. 46:13; Num. 26:23-24; 1 Chr. 7:1\). His descendants became one of the twelve tribes of Israel. 

In Jacob's blessing, Issachar was described as a "strong donkey" and "resting between the sheepfolds", indicating his tribe would be hardworking and content with an agrarian life \(Gen. 49:14-15\). 

During the wilderness years, the tribe of Issachar was led by Nethanel son of Zuar \(Num. 1:8; 2:5; 7:18; 10:15\). They encamped on the east side of the tabernacle under the standard of Judah \(Num. 2:5\). 

In the census taken in the wilderness of Sinai, the tribe of Issachar numbered 54,400 men aged 20 and over \(Num. 1:28-29\). In the second census on the plains of Moab they numbered 64,300 \(Num. 26:25\). 

Issachar's allotment in Canaan included the fertile Jezreel Valley and was bordered by Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun and Jordan \(Josh. 19:17-23\). The Levitical cities in Issachar's territory were Kishion, Daberath, Jarmuth and En-gannim \(Josh. 21:28-29\). 

The tribe of Issachar was commended for providing wise leadership during the time of David \(1 Chr. 12:32\). One of David's officers, Omri son of Michael, was from Issachar \(1 Chr. 27:18\). The tribe is also noted for being faithful to Hezekiah's Passover invitation \(2 Chr. 30:18\). 

In Ezekiel's vision of the division of the restored land, Issachar is allotted the sixth portion \(Ezek. 48:25-26\). In John's apocalyptic vision, Issachar is one of the tribes sealed by God \(Rev. 7:7\).
