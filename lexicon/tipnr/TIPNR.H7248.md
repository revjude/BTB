Rab-mag is mentioned as one of the Babylonian officials present at the capture of Jerusalem by the army of King Nebuchadnezzar \([[Jer.39.3|Jeremiah 39:3]], 13\). The name "Rab-mag" is likely a title rather than a personal name, possibly meaning "chief of the magi" or "chief soothsayer." The presence of Rab-mag, along with other officials such as Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, and Nebushazban, indicates that he was a high-ranking member of the Babylonian military or administrative hierarchy. After the city fell, these officials took up residence at the Middle Gate, a prominent location within Jerusalem. The specific duties and responsibilities of Rab-mag are not elaborated upon in the biblical text.
