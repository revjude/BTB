Eliakim is mentioned briefly in [[Neh.12.41|Nehemiah 12:41]] as one of the priests who participated in the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem. After the completion of the wall's reconstruction under Nehemiah's leadership, a great celebration was held. Two large choirs were appointed to give thanks and walk on top of the wall in opposite directions \(Nehemiah 12:31, 38\). Eliakim was among the priests who accompanied one of the choirs, along with other priests such as Maaseiah, Miniamin, and Micaiah. The presence of the priests in the dedication ceremony signified the importance of religious leadership and the restoration of worship in Jerusalem.
