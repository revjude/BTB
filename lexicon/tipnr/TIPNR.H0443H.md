Elzabad is mentioned as one of the sons of Shemaiah, a Korahite gatekeeper, during the reign of King David \([[1Chr.26.7|1Ch.26.7]]\). The Korahites were a clan within the tribe of Levi assigned to various duties in the tabernacle and later in the temple. Elzabad and his brothers are described as capable men with the strength to perform service, indicating their fitness for their role as gatekeepers. Gatekeepers were responsible for guarding the entrances to the temple, maintaining order, and ensuring that only authorized individuals entered the sacred precincts. The mention of Elzabad and his brothers suggests that gatekeeper duties were often assigned to families or clans, with multiple generations serving together. No further information is provided about Elzabad's specific responsibilities or his later life. His inclusion in the list of gatekeepers highlights the importance of this role in maintaining the sanctity and security of the temple during David's reign.
