The Decapolis was a group of ten Hellenistic cities located in ancient Palestine, primarily in modern-day Jordan, Syria, and Israel. The cities were centers of Greek culture and were granted a degree of autonomy under Roman rule. In the New Testament, the Decapolis is mentioned as a region where Jesus traveled and performed miracles \([[Matt.4.25|Matthew 4:25]]; [[Mark.5.20|Mark 5:20]]; 7:31\). The most notable event connected to the Decapolis is the healing of the demon-possessed man in the region of the Gerasenes \(Mark 5:1-20\). After being healed, the man went throughout the Decapolis proclaiming what Jesus had done for him, spreading the message of Christ in the region.
