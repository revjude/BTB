<small>*Near Eden • The land where Cain settled after killing Abel*</small>

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Nod</span> was the land east of Eden where Cain settled after he was banished for killing his brother Abel.
- A location only mentioned at [[Gen.4.16|Gen.4.16]]; 
- only referred to as Nod<[[H5113]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נו</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>\).

Nod was the land where Cain settled after he was banished by God for murdering his brother Abel \(Gen. 4:16\). The name "Nod" means "wandering," reflecting Cain's status as a fugitive and wanderer on the earth \(Gen. 4:12, 14\). The land of Nod was located to the east of Eden, but its precise location is not specified in the Bible. It is described as a place of exile, away from the presence of God and the rest of human society at that time.
