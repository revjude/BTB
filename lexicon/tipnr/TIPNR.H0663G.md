Aphek, also known as Aphekah, was a city located in the Shephelah, the foothills between the coastal plain and the Judean hills. It is mentioned in [[Josh.12.18|Joshua 12:18]] as one of the cities defeated by Joshua during the conquest of Canaan. Later, Aphek was part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Judah \([[Josh.15.53|Joshua 15:53]]\). 

The city is most notably associated with the conflicts between the Israelites and the Philistines. In [[1Sam.4.1|1 Samuel 4:1]], the Israelites camped at Ebenezer, while the Philistines camped at Aphek. The Philistines defeated the Israelites in battle and captured the Ark of the Covenant. Years later, during the reign of King Saul, the Philistines gathered their forces at Aphek before the fateful battle at Mount Gilboa, where Saul and his sons were killed \([[1Sam.29.1|1 Samuel 29:1]]\). 

The exact location of Aphek in the Shephelah is uncertain, but it is generally identified with Tel Aphek, a site near the Yarkon River, about 11 miles \(18 km\) northeast of Joppa. The city's strategic location along the coastal plain made it a significant military stronghold and a focal point of the ongoing struggles between Israel and the Philistines.
