Joshua, also known as Jeshua, was the high priest who played a significant role in the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. He was the son of Jehozadak \(or Jozadak\) and is mentioned in the books of Haggai, Zechariah, Ezra, and Nehemiah. 

Joshua is first mentioned among the leaders who returned from exile with Zerubbabel \([[Ezra.2.2|Ezra 2:2]]; [[Neh.7.7|Nehemiah 7:7]]\). He worked alongside Zerubbabel to rebuild the altar and lay the foundation of the temple \([[Ezra.3.2|Ezra 3:2]], 8\). When the temple construction faced opposition, Joshua and Zerubbabel successfully petitioned the Persian authorities to allow the work to continue \([[Ezra.5.2|Ezra 5:2]]\). 

The prophets Haggai and Zechariah delivered messages of encouragement and support to Joshua during the temple reconstruction \([[Hag.1.1|Haggai 1:1]], 12, 14; 2:2, 4; [[Zech.3.1|Zechariah 3:1]]-9; 6:11\). In a vision, Zechariah saw Joshua standing before the angel of the Lord, with Satan accusing him. The Lord rebuked Satan and affirmed His choice of Joshua as the high priest \([[Zech.3.1|Zechariah 3:1]]-5\). Joshua was also given a symbolic crown and a promise of the coming "Branch," a messianic figure \([[Zech.6.11|Zechariah 6:11]]-13\). 

Joshua continued to serve as high priest during the early years of the restored Jewish community in Jerusalem \([[Neh.12.1|Nehemiah 12:1]], 7, 10, 26\). His leadership, along with that of Zerubbabel, was instrumental in the completion of the temple and the reestablishment of Jewish worship in the post-exilic period.
