Pethor was a city in Mesopotamia, located near the Euphrates River, and is mentioned in the Bible as the hometown of Balaam, the prophet hired by Balak, king of Moab, to curse the Israelites \(Num. 22:5; Deut. 23:4\). When the Israelites were camped in the plains of Moab, Balak sent messengers to Pethor to summon Balaam, offering him payment to curse Israel \(Num. 22:5-7\). Despite God's initial warning not to go with the men, Balaam eventually set out on his donkey to meet with Balak \(Num. 22:21\). Along the way, the Angel of the Lord opposed Balaam, and his donkey spoke to him, revealing the presence of the Angel \(Num. 22:22-35\). Balaam ultimately blessed Israel instead of cursing them, following God's command \(Num. 23-24\). The location of Pethor is not precisely known, but its association with the Euphrates River suggests that it was situated in the upper Mesopotamian region, possibly in the area of modern-day Syria or Iraq.
