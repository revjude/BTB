<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Ananias</span>, a disciple in Damascus, was sent by God to heal and baptize Saul \(later known as Paul\) after his conversion on the road to Damascus.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at Act.9.10; 
- only referred to as Ananias **<big>[[G0367|Ἀνανίας]]</big>**.

Ananias was a disciple of Jesus Christ living in Damascus. After Saul's dramatic encounter with the risen Christ on the road to Damascus, Saul was left blind and was directed to go into the city to await further instructions. In a vision, the Lord told Ananias to go to the house where Saul was staying and lay hands on him to restore his sight. Initially hesitant due to Saul's reputation as a persecutor of the church, Ananias obeyed the Lord's command. He went to Saul, laid his hands on him, and conveyed the message that Jesus had sent him to restore Saul's sight and to fill him with the Holy Spirit. Ananias then baptized Saul, who later became known as Paul, the great apostle to the Gentiles. Ananias played a crucial role in the early days of Paul's Christian life, demonstrating faith and obedience to God's call.
