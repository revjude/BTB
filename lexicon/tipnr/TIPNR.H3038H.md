- A man from the tribe of Levi  living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[1Chr.9.16|1Ch.9.16]]; 
- referred to as Jeduthun or Jeduthun \(=Qere. Ketiv= Jedithun\) <[[H3038H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>דו</span>ּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>תו</span>ּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ן</span>\); 
-  father of Galal<[[H1559H]]>.

Jeduthun is mentioned in [[1Chr.9.16|1 Chronicles 9:16]] and [[Neh.11.17|Nehemiah 11:17]] as a Levite who served in Jerusalem after the return from the Babylonian exile. In [[1Chr.9.16|1 Chronicles 9:16]], he is described as a gatekeeper, belonging to the Levites who were responsible for guarding the entrances to the temple and maintaining order. In [[Neh.11.17|Nehemiah 11:17]], Jeduthun is identified as a singer, along with Bakbukiah and Abda, who led the thanksgiving songs in prayer. This suggests that he had a dual role in the post-exilic community, serving both as a gatekeeper and a musician in the temple. The text does not provide any further details about Jeduthun's life or his specific contributions to the rebuilding and restoration of Jerusalem after the exile. However, his mention in these passages highlights the importance of the Levites in maintaining the temple services and leading the worship of the community.
