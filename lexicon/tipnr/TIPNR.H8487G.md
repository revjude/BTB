Teman is mentioned in [[Gen.36.11|Genesis 36:11]],15,42 and [[1Chr.1.36|1 Chronicles 1:36]],53 as a son of Eliphaz and grandson of Esau. He was one of the chiefs of Edom. The name Teman is also associated with a prominent Edomite clan \([[Gen.36.34|Genesis 36:34]]; [[1Chr.1.45|1 Chronicles 1:45]]\) and a region in Edom known for its wisdom \(Jeremiah 49:7; Obadiah 1:9\). Several individuals from Teman are mentioned in the Book of Job, including Eliphaz the Temanite, one of Job's friends \([[Job.2.11|Job 2:11]]; 4:1; 15:1; 22:1; 42:7,9\). The Temanites were renowned for their wisdom, though Eliphaz's counsel to Job was ultimately misguided. Teman represents the wisdom and power of Edom, which was still inferior to the wisdom of God.
