Zipporah was the wife of Moses and the daughter of Jethro \(also known as Reuel\), the priest of Midian. She first appears in the biblical narrative when Moses fled from Egypt and settled in Midian \([[Exod.2.21|Exodus 2:21]]\). Zipporah and Moses were married and had two sons, Gershom and Eliezer. In Exodus 4:24-26, during Moses' return to Egypt, Zipporah circumcised their son and cast the foreskin at Moses' feet, saying, "Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me!" This enigmatic event seems to have resolved a divine threat against Moses' life. Later, when Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt, Zipporah and her sons were sent back to Jethro \([[Exod.18.2|Exodus 18:2]]\). They were reunited with Moses when Jethro brought them to him in the wilderness \(Exodus 18:5-6\). As the wife of Moses, Zipporah played a significant role in his personal life and, by extension, in the history of Israel.
