Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was a prominent figure during the reigns of King David and King Solomon. He is first mentioned as one of David's mighty men, known for his bravery and military prowess \([[2Sam.23.20|2 Samuel 23:20]]-23; [[1Chr.11.22|1 Chronicles 11:22]]-25\). Benaiah's exploits included killing two warriors of Moab, a lion in a pit on a snowy day, and an Egyptian giant. He was highly respected and held leadership positions in David's army, such as being the head of the king's bodyguard \([[2Sam.8.18|2 Samuel 8:18]]; 20:23\). During the succession crisis at the end of David's reign, Benaiah remained loyal to Solomon and played a crucial role in establishing him as king \([[1Kgs.1.8|1 Kings 1:8]], 10, 32-44\). He carried out Solomon's orders to execute Adonijah, Joab, and Shimei, effectively removing potential threats to the new king's reign \([[1Kgs.2.25|1 Kings 2:25]], 29-46\). Under Solomon's rule, Benaiah served as the commander of the army \([[1Kgs.4.4|1 Kings 4:4]]\) and was part of the king's inner circle of advisors. His loyalty, military skills, and unwavering support for the Davidic dynasty made him an invaluable asset to both David and Solomon.
