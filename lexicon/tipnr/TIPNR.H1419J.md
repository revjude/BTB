The Great Sea, also referred to as the Sea of the Philistines, is the biblical name for the Mediterranean Sea, which formed the western boundary of the Promised Land. In the description of the boundaries of the land allocated to the Israelites, the Great Sea is mentioned as the western limit \([[Num.34.6|Numbers 34:6]]-7; [[Josh.15.12|Joshua 15:12]]; [[Ezek.47.20|Ezekiel 47:20]]\). The extent of the Promised Land is described as reaching from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the Euphrates River \([[Exod.23.31|Exodus 23:31]]\). The Great Sea played a significant role in the history and geography of the region, with many important cities and ports located along its coast. The Philistines, who were a major enemy of the Israelites, occupied the coastal plain along the Great Sea \([[Josh.9.1|Joshua 9:1]]; 15:47\). In the prophetic visions of Ezekiel, the Great Sea is mentioned in the context of the boundaries of the restored land of Israel \([[Ezek.47.10|Ezekiel 47:10]], 15, 19; 48:28\). The Mediterranean Sea was a vital trade route and a source of resources for the ancient civilizations that inhabited the region, including the Israelites, Phoenicians, and Greeks.
