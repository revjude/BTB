Beth-shittah is mentioned in the Bible as a place near where the Midianite army fled after being defeated by Gideon and his three hundred men \(Jdg. 7:22\). The Midianites had been oppressing Israel, and God called Gideon to deliver His people. With a small army, Gideon strategically attacked the Midianites, causing them to panic and flee. The Midianites are described as fleeing as far as Beth-shittah, indicating that it was located some distance from the battlefield. No further details about the location or significance of Beth-shittah are provided in the Bible.
