Huldah was a prophetess who lived in Jerusalem during the reign of King Josiah of Judah \(640-609 BC\). She is mentioned in [[2Kgs.22.14|2 Kings 22:14]] and [[2Chr.34.22|2 Chronicles 34:22]] in connection with the discovery of the Book of the Law during the repair and restoration of the temple. 

When the high priest Hilkiah found the Book of the Law, King Josiah sent a delegation, including Hilkiah and the royal secretary Shaphan, to consult Huldah regarding the authenticity and significance of the discovered scroll. This indicates that Huldah was a recognized and respected prophetess in Jerusalem at the time. 

Huldah's prophetic message confirmed the genuineness of the Book of the Law and the consequences of Judah's disobedience to God's commandments. She declared that God would bring judgment upon Jerusalem and its inhabitants for their idolatry and unfaithfulness. However, she also conveyed a message of mercy for King Josiah, stating that because of his repentance and humility, he would not witness the calamity that would befall Judah \(2 Kings 22:15-20; 2 Chronicles 34:23-28\). 

Huldah's role as a prophetess during this crucial time in Judah's history highlights the importance of prophetic ministry and the significance of the rediscovery of the Book of the Law in sparking religious reform under King Josiah. Her message of judgment and mercy reflects the central themes of the prophetic books in the Bible, emphasizing the consequences of disobedience and the importance of repentance.
