- People from Mehun\(?\), first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.50|Ezr.2.50]]; 
- only referred to as Meunim **<big>[[H4586|מְעוּנִי]]</big>**.

The Meunim are mentioned in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah as one of the groups of temple servants who returned to Jerusalem from the Babylonian exile \([[Ezra.2.50|Ezr.2.50]]; [[Neh.7.52|Neh.7.52]]\). They are listed among the Nethinim, which were a class of people dedicated to assisting the Levites in the service of the temple. The Meunim's specific duties within the temple are not described in the biblical text. Their inclusion in the lists of returning exiles suggests that they played a role in the restoration of temple worship after the exile. The origin and earlier history of the Meunim are not provided in the Bible.
