Pharaoh living at the time of the Patriarchs

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Pharaoh</span>, the Egyptian ruler who took Abraham's wife Sarah into his palace during their visit to Egypt.
- An Egyptian Pharaoh living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at Gen.12.15; 
- only referred to as Pharaoh **<big>[[H6547|פַּרְעֹה]]</big>**.

This Pharaoh was the Egyptian ruler during the time of Abraham's visit to Egypt \(Genesis 12:10-20\). When Abraham and his wife Sarah entered Egypt, Abraham asked Sarah to say that she was his sister, fearing that the Egyptians would kill him to take her, as she was very beautiful. As a result, Pharaoh took Sarah into his palace, believing her to be unmarried. However, God afflicted Pharaoh and his household with plagues because of Sarah. Pharaoh, realizing that Sarah was Abraham's wife, rebuked Abraham for his deception and sent them away with wealth and possessions. The Bible does not provide the specific name or historical identity of this Pharaoh, as the term "Pharaoh" was used as a title for Egyptian kings.
