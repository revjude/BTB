Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, was a king of Israel who reigned for seventeen years, as recorded in [[2Kgs.10.35|2 Kings 10:35]] and 13:1. He succeeded his father, Jehu, on the throne of Israel. During his reign, Israel faced oppression from the Arameans, led by King Hazael and his son Ben-hadad \(2 Kings 13:3, 22\). The text states that Jehoahaz did evil in the sight of the Lord, following the sins of Jeroboam, which led to Israel's suffering \(2 Kings 13:2\). However, when Jehoahaz sought the Lord's favor, God provided a deliverer for Israel, allowing them to escape from the Arameans \([[2Kgs.13.4|2 Kings 13:4]]-5\). Despite this, Israel continued to face military challenges, and their army was greatly reduced \([[2Kgs.13.7|2 Kings 13:7]]\). Jehoahaz's reign was marked by ongoing conflict with the Arameans and the consequences of Israel's disobedience to God. After his death, his son Jehoash \(also known as Joash\) succeeded him as king \([[2Kgs.13.9|2 Kings 13:9]]\).
