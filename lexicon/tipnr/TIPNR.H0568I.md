Amariah is mentioned in the context of the organization of the Levites during the reign of King David. He is listed as a descendant of Hebron, one of the sons of Kohath, who was a son of Levi. \([[1Chr.23.19|1Ch.23.19]]\) 

During David's reign, the Levites were organized into various divisions to carry out their duties in the tabernacle and later in the temple. The descendants of Hebron, including Amariah, were among those assigned specific responsibilities. \(1Ch.23.12-23\) 

In the listing of the divisions of the Levites, Amariah is mentioned as the head of one of the families within the Hebronite clan. \([[1Chr.24.23|1Ch.24.23]]\) This suggests that he held a leadership role among his fellow Levites. 

The Levites were responsible for assisting the priests in the temple service, as well as for other duties such as teaching the law, maintaining the temple, and providing music for worship. 

Apart from these brief mentions, no further details are provided about Amariah's specific role, his actions, or any significant events associated with him. 

The inclusion of Amariah in the lists of the Levitical divisions highlights the importance of the Levites in the religious life of Israel and the organization of their duties during the reign of King David. It also demonstrates the continuity of the Levitical families and their service in the tabernacle and temple.
