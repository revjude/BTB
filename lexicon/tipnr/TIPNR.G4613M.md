Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Simon</span> was a sorcerer in Samaria who believed and was baptized but later tried to buy the power of the Holy Spirit from the apostles.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Luke.3.30|Act.8.9]]; 
- only referred to as Simon **<big>[[G4613|Σίμων]]</big>**.

Simon, often referred to as Simon Magus or Simon the Sorcerer, was a man living in Samaria who practiced sorcery and amazed the people with his magic \(Acts 8:9\). When Philip came to Samaria preaching the gospel, Simon believed and was baptized along with many others \(Acts 8:13\). However, when the apostles Peter and John arrived and laid hands on the believers to receive the Holy Spirit, Simon offered them money, wanting to buy the power to impart the Holy Spirit to others \(Acts 8:18-19\). Peter sternly rebuked Simon for his attempt to purchase God's gift with money, telling him to repent of his wickedness and pray for forgiveness \(Acts 8:20-23\). Simon, frightened by Peter's words, asked the apostles to pray for him \(Acts 8:24\). This account serves as a warning against the sin of simony \(attempting to buy or sell spiritual gifts or offices\) and emphasizes that God's gifts cannot be obtained through material means but are freely given by His grace.
