Salma is mentioned in [[1Chr.2.51|1 Chronicles 2:51]] and 2:54 as the son of Hur, who was a descendant of Judah, though the text is difficult to interpret. He is described as the father \(ie founder\) of Bethlehem, which suggests that he was an ancestor of the people who inhabited the town of Bethlehem in Judah. The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 2 lists the descendants of Judah, including the line of Caleb, which played a significant role in the history of Israel. In verse 54, Salma is also associated with the Netophathites, a group of people who lived in the town of Netophah, near Bethlehem \(Ezra 2:22; Nehemiah 7:26\). This connection further emphasizes Salma's link to the region of Bethlehem and its surrounding areas. As the father of Bethlehem, Salma's mention in the genealogy highlights the importance of this town, which later became the birthplace of King David and Jesus Christ.
