- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[Isa.7.6|Isa.7.6]]; 
- only referred to as Tabeal **<big>[[H2870|טָבְאֵל]]</big>**.

Tabeal is mentioned in [[Isa.7.6|Isaiah 7:6]] as the man whom Rezin king of Syria and Pekah king of Israel \(Ephraim\) planned to install as king of Judah in place of Ahaz. This was part of their plot to invade Judah and replace Ahaz with a puppet ruler. The name Tabeal is Aramaic and may mean "Good is God" or "God is good." No other details are provided about Tabeal's identity or background. The conspiracy of Syria and Ephraim against Judah was part of the Syro-Ephraimite War, which occurred around 735-732 BC. However, their plot did not succeed, as Ahaz appealed to Assyria for help, and the Assyrian king defeated Syria and Israel.
