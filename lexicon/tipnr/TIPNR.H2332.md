<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Eve</span> was the first woman, created as Adam's wife, who was tempted by the serpent and ate the forbidden fruit.
- A woman living at the time before the Flood, first mentioned at [[Gen.3.20|Gen.3.20]]; 
- referred to as Eve **<big>[[H2332|חַוָּה]]</big>**, or Eve **<big>[[G2096|Εὖα]]</big>**; 
-  wife of Adam **<big>[[H0121|אָדָם]]</big>**; 
-  mother of Cain **<big>[[H7014|קַיִן]]</big>**, Abel **<big>[[H1893|הֶבֶל]]</big>** and Seth **<big>[[H8352|שֵׁת]]</big>**.

Eve was the first woman, created by God as a companion for Adam \(Genesis 2:22\). She was formed from one of Adam's ribs and was named "Eve" because she would become the mother of all living \([[Gen.3.20|Genesis 3:20]]\). Eve was tempted by the serpent to eat the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which God had forbidden \(Genesis 3:1-6\). She ate the fruit and gave some to Adam, resulting in their disobedience and the introduction of sin into the world \(Genesis 3:6-7\). As a consequence, Eve experienced pain in childbirth and a desire for her husband, while Adam had to labor to provide for them \(Genesis 3:16-19\). Despite this, Eve is recognized as the mother of the human race \([[Gen.4.1|Genesis 4:1]]\). Paul references Eve's deception as a warning against false teachers \([[2Cor.11.3|2 Corinthians 11:3]]\) and notes that Adam was created first, then Eve \([[1Tim.2.13|1 Timothy 2:13]]\).
