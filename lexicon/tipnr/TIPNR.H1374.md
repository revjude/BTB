Gebim is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Isa.10.31|Isaiah 10:31]], as part of a prophetic description of the Assyrian army's advance towards Jerusalem. The passage lists several towns and cities in the region of Benjamin that would be affected by the invasion. 

According to Isaiah's prophecy, the inhabitants of Gebim are described as fleeing, suggesting that the town was in the path of the advancing Assyrian forces and that its people sought to escape the impending danger. 

The exact location of Gebim is uncertain, but based on its mention alongside other towns in Benjamin, such as Anathoth and Nob, it is believed to have been situated north of Jerusalem, possibly in the vicinity of Ramah. 

The name "Gebim" is derived from the Hebrew word meaning "cisterns" or "trenches," which may indicate that the town was known for its water storage facilities or its location near a series of trenches or ravines. 

Apart from this single reference in Isaiah, no other information about Gebim is provided in the Bible. Its mention serves to illustrate the widespread fear and disruption caused by the Assyrian invasion and to underscore the imminent threat to Jerusalem and the surrounding region.
