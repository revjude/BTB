Anab is mentioned in [[Josh.11.21|Joshua 11:21]] and 15:50 as a city in the hill country of Judah. During the conquest of Canaan, Joshua defeated the Anakim, a race of giants, and captured the city of Anab along with Debir and Hebron \([[Josh.11.21|Joshua 11:21]]\). Later, in the description of the territory allotted to Judah, Anab is listed among the cities in the hill country \([[Josh.15.50|Joshua 15:50]]\). 

The exact location of Anab is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the vicinity of Debir and Hebron, which are approximately 12 miles \(19 km\) southwest of Jerusalem. The city's capture by Joshua and its inclusion in the list of Judah's cities highlight its importance in the region during the early stages of Israel's settlement in the Promised Land. 

No other information about Anab is provided in the Bible, and the city is not mentioned in any other context. Its significance lies primarily in its association with the conquest of Canaan and the defeat of the Anakim, which marked a crucial step in Israel's possession of the land promised to their forefathers.
