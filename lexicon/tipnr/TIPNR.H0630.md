Aspatha was one of the ten sons of Haman, the chief antagonist in the book of Esther. Haman, a high-ranking official in the Persian court, plotted to exterminate the Jewish people throughout the Persian Empire. However, his plan was thwarted by Queen Esther and her cousin Mordecai, resulting in Haman's execution. In the aftermath of Haman's downfall, King Ahasuerus granted the Jews permission to defend themselves against their enemies. During this time, the ten sons of Haman, including Aspatha, were also executed, marking the end of the threat against the Jewish people and the triumph of Esther and Mordecai.
