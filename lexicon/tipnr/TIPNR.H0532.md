Man living at the time of Exile and Return

The descendants of <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Ami</span> \(or Amon\) were among the returned exiles who were servants of Solomon.
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.57|Ezr.2.57]]; 
- referred to as Ami **<big>[[H0532|אָמִי]]</big>**, or Amon **<big>[[H0526|אָמוֹן]]</big>**.

Ami, also known as Amon, was the head of a family whose descendants were among the returned exiles from Babylon. They were listed among the servants of Solomon, suggesting that their ancestors had been assigned by King Solomon to perform specific duties or services. The descendants of Ami were part of the group that returned to Jerusalem and Judah under the leadership of Zerubbabel, as recorded in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. They likely played a role in the rebuilding of the temple and the restoration of Jewish worship in Jerusalem after the exile.
