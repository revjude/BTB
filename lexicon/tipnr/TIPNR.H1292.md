- A man living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Job.32.2|Job.32.2]]; 
- only referred to as Barachel **<big>[[H1292|בָּרַכְאֵל]]</big>**; 
-  father of Elihu **<big>[[H0453|אֱלִיהוּ]]</big>**.

Barachel is mentioned in [[Job.32.2|Job 32:2]] and 32:6 as the father of Elihu, one of the men who engaged in a dialogue with Job. Barachel is described as a Buzite, indicating that he was from the region of Buz, possibly located in northern Arabia or southern Edom. Elihu, his son, is introduced as a younger man who had been listening to the conversation between Job and his three friends \(Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar\). After the three friends had finished speaking, Elihu became angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God and with the friends for not refuting Job's arguments effectively. Elihu then proceeded to present his own perspective on Job's situation and God's justice. Apart from being Elihu's father and a Buzite, no other information is provided about Barachel himself.
