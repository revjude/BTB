Cnidus was an ancient Greek city located on the Datça Peninsula in the southwestern part of Asia Minor, in modern-day Turkey. It is mentioned once in the Bible, in Acts 27:7, in the context of Paul's journey to Rome as a prisoner. 

After setting sail from Myra, the ship carrying Paul and other prisoners encountered difficulty sailing due to unfavorable winds. They sailed slowly for many days and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus. Unable to continue sailing westward, they turned south and sailed along the sheltered side of Crete. 

Cnidus was known for its strategic location, with two harbors providing shelter from various wind directions. The city was also famous for its sculpture, particularly the Aphrodite of Cnidus, a renowned work by the sculptor Praxiteles. 

The mention of Cnidus in Acts 27 provides insight into the route taken by Paul and his companions during their journey to Rome and the challenges they faced while navigating the Mediterranean Sea. It also demonstrates the apostle's determination to reach Rome, despite the difficulties and dangers encountered along the way.
