Arad was a Canaanite city located in the Negev desert. During Israel's wilderness journey, the king of Arad attacked the Israelites and took some of them captive \(Num. 21:1\). Israel vowed to destroy the city if God gave them victory, which they did, renaming the place Hormah \(Num. 21:2-3\). Later, after the conquest of Canaan, Arad was included in the list of cities defeated by Joshua \(Jos. 12:14\). In the time of the judges, the Kenites, descendants of Moses' father-in-law, settled in the wilderness of Judah, south of Arad \(Jdg. 1:16\). The city's mentions in the Bible highlight its strategic location and its interactions with the Israelites during their early history.
