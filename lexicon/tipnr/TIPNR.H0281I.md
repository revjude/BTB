Ahijah is mentioned in the Bible as the father of Baasha, who became the third king of Israel after Jeroboam I. Baasha, the son of Ahijah, was from the tribe of Issachar and reigned over Israel for 24 years. \([[1Kgs.15.27|1Ki.15.27]],33\) 

During his reign, Baasha did evil in the sight of the Lord and walked in the ways of Jeroboam, leading Israel into sin. \(1Ki.15.34\) The prophet Jehu, son of Hanani, prophesied against Baasha and his house, declaring that they would meet a fate similar to that of Jeroboam's house. \(1Ki.16.1-4\) 

Ahijah is mentioned in the context of God's judgment against the house of Baasha, as God declared that He would bring disaster upon Baasha and his house, making it like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. \([[1Kgs.21.22|1Ki.21.22]]; [[2Kgs.9.9|2Ki.9.9]]\)
