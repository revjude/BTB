Shaharaim, mentioned in [[1Chr.8.8|1 Chronicles 8:8]], was a member of the tribe of Benjamin. The text states that he had two wives, Hushim and Baara, and that he sent them away. This brief mention of Shaharaim occurs within the genealogical records of the Benjamites. The act of sending away his wives suggests a form of divorce or separation, though the reasons behind this action are not provided in the text. After this, Shaharaim had children in the country of Moab, possibly indicating that he relocated there after separating from his wives. The names of his children born in Moab are listed, including Jobab, Zibia, Mesha, Malcam, Jeuz, Sakia, and Mirmah.
