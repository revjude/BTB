Mahalalel is mentioned in the genealogies of Genesis 5, 1 Chronicles 1, and Luke 3 as a descendant of Seth, the third son of Adam and Eve. He is an ancestor of Noah and is part of the lineage that leads to Abraham, David, and ultimately, Jesus Christ. According to Genesis 5, Mahalalel was the son of Kenan and the father of Jared \([[Gen.5.12|Gen.5.12]],15\). He lived for 895 years, which was typical of the long lifespans recorded for the pre-flood patriarchs \([[Gen.5.13|Gen.5.13]],16,17\). The genealogies in Genesis 5 and 1 Chronicles 1 focus on the line of descent from Adam to Noah, highlighting the continuity of the godly lineage before the flood. The genealogy in Luke 3 traces Jesus' ancestry back to Adam, emphasizing His connection to all of humanity. Mahalalel's inclusion in these genealogies serves to establish the historical and theological context of God's plan of redemption through the descendants of Seth, ultimately leading to the birth of Jesus Christ.
