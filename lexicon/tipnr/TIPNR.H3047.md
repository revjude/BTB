Jada is mentioned in [[1Chr.2.28|1 Chronicles 2:28]] and 32 as part of the genealogy of the tribe of Judah. He is identified as the son of Onam and the brother of Shammai. 

The genealogy in this chapter traces the descendants of Judah, one of the twelve sons of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\). It provides a detailed record of the families and clans within the tribe of Judah, highlighting significant individuals and their relationships. 

Jada's father, Onam, is listed as a descendant of Jerahmeel, who was one of the sons of Hezron, a grandson of Judah \(1Ch.2.25\). This places Jada within the larger context of the Jerahmeelite clan within the tribe of Judah. 

Apart from his familial connections, no other specific details are provided about Jada's life, occupation, or role within the tribe. His inclusion in the genealogy serves to maintain a record of the lineage of Judah and to demonstrate the continuity of the tribe through successive generations. 

The preservation of such genealogical records was important for the Israelites, as it helped to establish tribal identity, inheritance rights, and the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
