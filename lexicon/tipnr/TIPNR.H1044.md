Beth-eked, meaning "house of binding" or "shearing house" in Hebrew, is mentioned in [[2Kgs.10.12|2 Kings 10:12]] and 14 in the context of Jehu's purge of the house of Ahab and the royal family of Judah. After Jehu had killed King Jehoram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah, he set out to eliminate any potential rivals to his claim to the throne. 

On his way to Samaria, Jehu came to Beth-eked, where he encountered forty-two brothers of Ahaziah. These men were likely coming to visit the royal family in Samaria, unaware of the recent coup. Jehu ordered his men to take the brothers alive and then slaughter them at the pit of Beth-eked. The text emphasizes that Jehu killed all forty-two men, leaving none of them alive. 

The exact location of Beth-eked is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated between Jezreel and Samaria, possibly serving as a resting place for travelers or a center for sheep-shearing. The name "Beth-eked" suggests that it may have been a place where sheep were bound for shearing. 

Jehu's actions at Beth-eked were part of his larger campaign to eliminate the house of Ahab and establish himself as the new king of Israel. His purge was seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy given by Elijah against the house of Ahab \(1 Kings 21:21-24\).
