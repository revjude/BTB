Kue is mentioned in 1 Kings 10:28 and 2 Chronicles 1:16 as one of the places from which King Solomon acquired horses. The verses state that Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and Kue, with the king's merchants purchasing them from Kue at a fixed price. The exact location of Kue is not specified in the Bible, but it is likely a region known for horse breeding and trading in the ancient Near East.
