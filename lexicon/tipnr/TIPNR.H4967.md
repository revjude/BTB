Methushael is mentioned in the book of Genesis as a descendant of Cain, the son of Adam and Eve \(Gen.4.18\). He was the son of Mehujael and the father of Lamech. Methushael is part of the genealogy that traces the line of Cain, which is separate from the godly line of Seth. The Cainite genealogy is known for the development of various skills and crafts, as well as the increasing wickedness and violence on the earth. Lamech, Methushael's son, is recorded as the first polygamist and a man of violence \(Gen.4.19-24\). No further details about Methushael's life, character, or achievements are provided in the biblical text. His mention serves to bridge the generations between Cain and Lamech in the genealogical record.
