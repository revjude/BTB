Ahira, the son of Enan, was a prominent leader of the tribe of Naphtali during the Israelites' exodus from Egypt and their subsequent journey through the wilderness. He was appointed by God as the head of his tribe and played a significant role in the organization and leadership of the Israelite community. \([[Num.1.15|Num.1.15]]\) 

In the arrangement of the Israelite camp, Ahira and the tribe of Naphtali were positioned on the north side of the tabernacle, along with the tribes of Dan and Asher. \([[Num.2.29|Num.2.29]]\). 

As a tribal leader, Ahira was responsible for presenting the offerings of the tribe of Naphtali during the dedication of the altar. He brought his offering on the twelfth day, which included various silver and gold utensils, as well as animals for sacrifices. \([[Num.7.78|Num.7.78]],83\) 

When the Israelites set out from Mount Sinai, Ahira and the tribe of Naphtali were part of the rearguard, marching last among the tribal divisions. \([[Num.10.27|Num.10.27]]\) 

Throughout the wilderness journey, Ahira would have played a crucial role in leading his tribe, ensuring their obedience to God's commands, and representing their interests before Moses and the other tribal leaders. However, no further specific details about his life or leadership are recorded in the biblical text.
