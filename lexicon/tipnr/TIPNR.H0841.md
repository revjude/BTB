Asharelah, also known as Jesharelah, was a Levite musician during the reign of King David. He was one of the sons of Asaph, a prominent Levite musician and psalmist. Asharelah was appointed by David to lead a group of musicians who prophesied with lyres, along with his brothers. This role involved using music as a means of prophetic worship and declaring the words of the Lord. Asharelah's inclusion in this list of musicians highlights the importance of music and prophetic worship in the Israelite culture during David's reign.
