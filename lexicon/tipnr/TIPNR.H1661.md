Gath was one of the five principal cities of the Philistines, along with Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, and Ekron \([[Josh.13.3|Joshua 13:3]]\). It was located in the coastal plain of Philistia, near the border with Judah. The city is mentioned numerous times throughout the Old Testament, often in the context of conflicts between the Israelites and the Philistines. 

During the conquest of Canaan, Gath was one of the last strongholds of the Anakim, a race of giants \([[Josh.11.22|Joshua 11:22]]\). The city gained prominence as the hometown of Goliath, the giant warrior who was defeated by David in single combat \([[1Sam.17.4|1 Samuel 17:4]], 23\). 

Gath played a significant role in the life of David. When fleeing from King Saul, David sought refuge in Gath, where he pretended to be insane to avoid arousing suspicion \([[1Sam.21.10|1 Samuel 21:10]]-15\). Later, David returned to Gath and served under King Achish, who gave him the town of Ziklag \([[1Sam.27.2|1 Samuel 27:2]]-6\). 

The city was captured by David during his reign as king \([[1Chr.18.1|1 Chronicles 18:1]]\), and it was also attacked by later Israelite kings, such as Uzziah \([[2Chr.26.6|2 Chronicles 26:6]]\) and Hezekiah \(2 Kings 18:8\). The term "Gittite" is used to refer to people from Gath, such as Obed-Edom, in whose house the Ark of the Covenant was temporarily kept \([[2Sam.6.10|2 Samuel 6:10]]-11\). 

Gath is also mentioned in prophetic texts, such as Amos 6:2 and [[Mic.1.10|Micah 1:10]], which speak of the city's destruction and the fate of its inhabitants. The exact location of Gath is uncertain, but it is believed to be Tell es-Safi, an archaeological site in modern-day Israel.
