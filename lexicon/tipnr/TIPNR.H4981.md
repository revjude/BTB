The Mithnites are a group mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.11.43|1 Chronicles 11:43]] in connection with Joshaphat, one of David's mighty warriors. The passage lists several of David's elite soldiers, and Joshaphat is described as "the Mithnite," suggesting that he belonged to or came from a place or family known as Mithnite. 

However, beyond this single reference, no additional information is provided about the Mithnites in the Bible. The location, history, or significance of this group remains unknown, as they are not mentioned in any other biblical text. 

The lack of further details about the Mithnites leaves many questions unanswered, such as whether they were a tribe, a clan, or the inhabitants of a specific city or region. It is also unclear what their relationship was to the other tribes of Israel or what role they played in the nation's history. 

Despite the scarcity of information, the mention of Joshaphat the Mithnite among David's mighty warriors suggests that at least one member of this group was known for his military prowess and loyalty to the king. This inclusion also highlights the diverse backgrounds of the individuals who made up David's army and the support he received from various groups within Israel.
