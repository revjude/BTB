Anak was the progenitor of the Anakim, a race of giants who lived in Canaan prior to the Israelite conquest. The Anakim were known for their great height and strength, which struck fear into the hearts of the Israelite spies who were sent to scout out the land. The spies reported that the descendants of Anak were among the inhabitants of Canaan, comparing them to the Nephilim, another race of giants. 

During the conquest of Canaan under Joshua's leadership, the Israelites fought against the Anakim and gradually drove them out of the land. Caleb, one of the faithful spies, was given Hebron as his inheritance, which was formerly known as Kiriath-arba and was associated with Anak. Caleb successfully expelled the descendants of Anak from Hebron. 

The Anakim were also mentioned as having lived in the land of Moab and Edom, where they were known as Emim and Rephaim, respectively. These giant peoples were gradually displaced or destroyed by the Israelites and the surrounding nations. The memory of the Anakim and their formidable presence in Canaan served as a reminder of God's faithfulness in giving the land to His people, despite the challenges they faced.
