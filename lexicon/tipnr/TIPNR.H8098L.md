Shemaiah was a Levite who lived during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. According to [[2Chr.31.15|2 Chronicles 31:15]], he was one of the Levites appointed to distribute the offerings, tithes, and dedicated things faithfully to their brothers in the cities of the priests. This distribution was part of Hezekiah's reforms to ensure that the priests and Levites received their due portions, enabling them to devote themselves to the Law of the Lord. Shemaiah worked alongside other Levites, including Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in this important task of supporting the religious leaders of the nation.
