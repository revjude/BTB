Azariahu is mentioned in 2 Chronicles 21:2 as one of the sons of King Jehoshaphat of Judah. This is an alternate spelling of the name Azariah, which appears in the same verse. Azariahu was a brother of Jehoram, who succeeded Jehoshaphat as king. Jehoshaphat gave his sons many gifts of silver, gold, and valuable possessions, along with fortified cities in Judah. However, he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the firstborn. The text does not provide further details about Azariahu's life or role in the kingdom. The mention of Azariahu and his brothers receiving gifts and cities from their father suggests that Jehoshaphat sought to provide for his sons and ensure their well-being, even as he passed the throne to his eldest son.
