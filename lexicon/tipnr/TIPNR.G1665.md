Elizabeth was the wife of Zechariah, a priest from the division of Abijah, and the mother of John the Baptist \([[Luke.1.5|Luk.1.5]],13\). She was a descendant of Aaron, making her a Levite \([[Luke.1.5|Luk.1.5]]\). Elizabeth and her husband were described as righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord \(Luk.1.6\). Despite their righteousness, Elizabeth was barren, and both she and Zechariah were advanced in years \([[Luke.1.7|Luk.1.7]]\). An angel appeared to Zechariah and announced that Elizabeth would bear a son, who was to be named John \([[Luke.1.13|Luk.1.13]]\). When Elizabeth conceived, she remained in seclusion for five months, praising God for His favor \([[Luke.1.24|Luk.1.24]]-25\). During her sixth month of pregnancy, her relative Mary, who was carrying Jesus, visited her \([[Luke.1.36|Luk.1.36]],39-40\). Upon hearing Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in Elizabeth's womb, and she was filled with the Holy Spirit, blessing Mary and her child \(Luk.1.41-45\). After the birth of John, Elizabeth and Zechariah had him circumcised and named on the eighth day, according to the angel's instructions \([[Luke.1.5|Luk.1.5]]9-63\). The Bible does not provide further details about Elizabeth's life after these events.
