- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Num.21.23b|Act.15.22]]; 
- referred to as Silas or \[ \] \(KJV= Silas\)  **<big>[[G4609|Σίλας]]</big>**, or Silvanus \(NIV= Silas\)  **<big>[[G4610|Σιλουανός]]</big>**.

Silas, also known as Silvanus, was a significant figure in the early Christian church, particularly in his role as a companion of the apostle Paul. He is first mentioned in Acts 15:22 as a prominent member of the Jerusalem church, along with Judas Barsabbas, chosen to accompany Paul and Barnabas to Antioch to deliver the decision of the Jerusalem Council regarding Gentile believers. 

Described as a prophet \(Acts 15:32\), Silas played a vital role in encouraging and strengthening the churches. After parting ways with Barnabas, Paul chose Silas as his new companion for his second missionary journey \(Acts 15:40\). Together, they traveled through Syria, Cilicia, and various cities in Asia Minor, preaching the gospel and establishing churches. 

In Philippi, Paul and Silas were imprisoned for their ministry but were miraculously freed by an earthquake \(Acts 16:19-40\). They continued their journey, ministering in Thessalonica, Berea, and Corinth \(Acts 17:1-18:5\). Silas remained with Paul in Corinth for an extended period, helping him establish the church there. 

In addition to his missionary work, Silas is also mentioned as a co-author of some of Paul's epistles, specifically 1 and 2 Thessalonians \([[1Thess.1.1|1 Thessalonians 1:1]]; [[2Thess.1.1|2 Thessalonians 1:1]]\). He is also referred to as Silvanus in [[2Cor.1.19|2 Corinthians 1:19]] and [[1Pet.5.12|1 Peter 5:12]], where he is described as a faithful brother. 

Silas' dedication to the gospel, his leadership in the early church, and his partnership with Paul make him an important figure in the spread of Christianity during the first century.
