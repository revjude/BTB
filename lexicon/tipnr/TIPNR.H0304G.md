Ahlai is mentioned briefly in the genealogy of the tribe of Judah, specifically in the lineage of Jerahmeel. She is listed as the daughter of Sheshan, who was a descendant of Jerahmeel through her son Shammai. \(1Ch.2.25,31\) 

The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 2 traces the descendants of Judah, focusing on the clans of Jerahmeel, Hezron, and others. It provides a detailed record of the families within the tribe of Judah. 

Apart from being mentioned as the daughter of Sheshan, no further information is given about Ahlai's life, her role within the family, or any significant events associated with her. 

However, the genealogy goes on to mention that Sheshan had no sons, only daughters. One of her daughters married the Egyptian servant, Jarha, and their descendants are listed in the following verses. \(1Ch.2.34-41\) This suggests that the lineage was continued through Sheshan's daughters.
