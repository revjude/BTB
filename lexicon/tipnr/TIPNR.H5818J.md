Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Uzziah</span> was an Israelite who had married a foreign wife during the Exile.
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.21|Ezr.10.21]]; 
- only referred to as Uzziah **<big>[[H5818|עֻזִּיָּה]]</big>**.

Uzziah is mentioned in the list of men who had taken foreign wives during the Babylonian exile. This was discovered when Ezra, the priest and scribe, returned to Jerusalem and found that many Israelites had intermarried with the pagan peoples of the land. Uzziah was one of those who had violated God's command not to intermarry with foreigners. In response to Ezra's call for repentance, Uzziah and the others agreed to put away their foreign wives and children to maintain the purity of the Jewish people.
