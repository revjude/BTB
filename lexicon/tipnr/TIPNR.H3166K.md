Jahaziel is mentioned briefly in [[Ezra.8.5|Ezra 8:5]] as one of the descendants of Shecaniah who returned with Ezra from Babylon to Jerusalem. This chapter lists the family heads and some of their descendants who joined Ezra in his journey to Jerusalem, which took place during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia \(Ezr.7.1-10\). 

Ezra, a priest and scribe, had been granted permission and support by Artaxerxes to return to Jerusalem to teach and enforce the Law of God \(Ezr.7.11-26\). He gathered a group of Israelites, including priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants, to accompany him on this mission \(Ezr.8.1-20\). 

Jahaziel is listed among the descendants of Shecaniah, son of Jahaziel, who joined Ezra in this journey \([[Ezra.8.5|Ezr.8.5]]\). This suggests that Jahaziel was part of a family that was committed to returning to Jerusalem and supporting the restoration of the temple and the religious life of the community. 

No other specific details are provided about Jahaziel's life, occupation, or role in the community. His inclusion in this list, however, highlights the importance of the various families and individuals who chose to return to Jerusalem and participate in the restoration of the city and the temple during the time of Ezra.
