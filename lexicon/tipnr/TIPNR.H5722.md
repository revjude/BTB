Man living at the time of United Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Adino</span> the Eznite is mentioned in some translations of [[2Sam.23.8|2 Samuel 23:8]] as one of David's mighty men, but the Hebrew text is unclear, and it may be a description of Josheb-Basshebeth's actions rather than a separate person.
- A man living at the time of United Monarchy, only mentioned at [[2Sam.23.8|2Sa.23.8]]; 
- only referred to as Adino<[[H5722]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ֲ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ינו</span>ֹ\).

The name Adino appears in some translations of [[2Sam.23.8|2 Samuel 23:8]], which is part of a list of David's mighty men. However, the Hebrew text is ambiguous, and there is uncertainty about whether Adino is a separate individual or a description of the actions of Josheb-Basshebeth, who is mentioned in the same verse. 

In the New King James Version, for example, the verse reads, "Josheb-Basshebeth the Tachmonite, chief among the captains. He was called Adino the Eznite because he had killed eight hundred men at one time." Here, Adino seems to be an alternate name or title for Josheb-Basshebeth. 

However, other translations, such as the New International Version, render the verse differently: "Josheb-Basshebeth, a Tahkemonite, was chief of the Three; he raised his spear against eight hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter." In this translation, the phrase "Adino the Eznite" is not present, and the focus is on Josheb-Basshebeth's feat of killing eight hundred men. 

Due to the ambiguity in the Hebrew text, it is difficult to determine conclusively whether Adino is a separate individual or a description of Josheb-Basshebeth's actions. As a result, Adino's identity and role remain uncertain.
