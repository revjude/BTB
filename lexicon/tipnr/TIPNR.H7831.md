Shahazumah is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the description of the territorial allotment for the tribe of Issachar \(Josh. 19:22\). The town is listed as one of the border points of Issachar's territory, along with Beth-shemesh and En-gannim. The exact location of Shahazumah is unknown, but it was likely situated in the region of the Jezreel Valley, north of Mount Gilboa. The name "Shahazumah" is of uncertain meaning and origin, and no other historical or archaeological information about the town has been discovered. Its mention in the biblical text serves to delineate the extent of Issachar's territory and provides insight into the geographical distribution of the Israelite tribes during the period of the conquest and settlement of Canaan.
