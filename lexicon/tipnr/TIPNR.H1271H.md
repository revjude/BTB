- A man living at the time of United Monarchy, only mentioned at [[2Sam.21.8|2Sa.21.8]]; 
- only referred to as Barzillai **<big>[[H1271|בַּרְזִלַּי]]</big>**;

Barzillai the Meholathite is briefly mentioned in [[2Sam.21.8|2 Samuel 21:8]] as the grandfather of the five sons whom Michal, Saul's daughter, had adopted. These five sons, born to Adriel son of Barzillai, were among the seven descendants of Saul who were handed over to the Gibeonites to be executed as a form of atonement for Saul's earlier mistreatment of the Gibeonites. The passage does not provide any further information about Barzillai the Meholathite himself, and he is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. His inclusion in the text serves to identify the lineage of Michal's adopted sons and their connection to Saul's family.
