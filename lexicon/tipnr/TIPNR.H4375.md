Machpelah was a cave located near Hebron in Canaan, which Abraham purchased from Ephron the Hittite as a burial place for his wife Sarah \([[Gen.23.9|Genesis 23:9]], 17-19\). The field and the cave were deeded to Abraham as a possession for a burying place \(Genesis 23:20\). Abraham himself was later buried in the cave of Machpelah by his sons Isaac and Ishmael \([[Gen.25.9|Genesis 25:9]]-10\). The cave also became the burial place for Isaac, Rebekah, and Leah \([[Gen.49.30|Genesis 49:30]]-31\), as well as Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) \([[Gen.50.13|Genesis 50:13]]\). The cave of Machpelah served as a significant burial site for the patriarchs and their wives, and it represented the Israelites' connection to the land of Canaan.
