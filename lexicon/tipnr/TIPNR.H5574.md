Hassenuah, also known as Hassenaah, was a leader from the tribe of Benjamin who lived in Jerusalem during the post-exilic period, as recorded in the books of Nehemiah and 1 Chronicles \([[Neh.11.9|Nehemiah 11:9]]; [[1Chr.9.7|1 Chronicles 9:7]]; [[Neh.3.3|Nehemiah 3:3]]\). He is mentioned in the context of the resettlement of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the city walls. 

In [[Neh.11.9|Nehemiah 11:9]], Hassenuah is described as the second-in-command over the city of Jerusalem, serving under Joel the son of Zichri. This suggests that Hassenuah held a significant leadership role in the administration of Jerusalem during this time. 

The parallel passage in [[1Chr.9.7|1 Chronicles 9:7]] also mentions Hassenuah \(spelled as Hassenaah\) among the Benjaminites who settled in Jerusalem. This further confirms his identity as a member of the tribe of Benjamin and his involvement in the resettlement of the city. 

In [[Neh.3.3|Nehemiah 3:3]], Hassenaah \(spelled as Hassenuah\) is mentioned in connection with the rebuilding of the Fish Gate during the reconstruction of the walls of Jerusalem. This indicates that he and his family or clan were involved in the restoration efforts and contributed to the rebuilding of the city's defenses.
