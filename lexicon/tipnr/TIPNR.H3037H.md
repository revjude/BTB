<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Jaddua</span> served as the high priest during the reign of Darius the Persian and was contemporary with Alexander the Great \([[Neh.12.11|Neh.12.11]],22\).
- A High Priest from the tribe of Levi living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Neh.12.11|Neh.12.11]]; 
- only referred to as Jaddua<[[H3037H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ו</span>ּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ַ\); 
- a son of Johanan<[[H3110L]]>.

Jaddua is mentioned in [[Neh.12.11|Nehemiah 12:11]] and 22 as a high priest who served during the reign of Darius the Persian. He was the son of Jonathan and the grandson of Joiada, who were also high priests \([[Neh.12.11|Neh.12.11]]\). 

The genealogy in Nehemiah 12 traces the succession of high priests from the time of the first return from Babylonian exile under Jeshua until the reign of Darius the Persian, also known as Darius III or Darius Codomannus \(336-331 BC\). This places Jaddua's tenure as high priest in the late 4th century BC. 

[[Neh.12.22|Nehemiah 12:22]] mentions that the Levites were recorded as heads of their fathers' houses during the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, until the reign of Darius the Persian. This suggests that Jaddua served as high priest for a considerable time, possibly spanning the reigns of multiple Persian kings. 

According to Jewish tradition, as recorded in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews \(XI.8.4-5\), Jaddua was the high priest who met Alexander the Great when the Macedonian king approached Jerusalem during his conquest of the Persian Empire. However, this account is not mentioned in the biblical text. 

Jaddua's inclusion in the genealogy of high priests in Nehemiah 12 highlights the continuity of the priestly line and the importance of the high priestly office in the post-exilic Jewish community. It also provides a valuable historical reference point, linking the biblical narrative to the broader context of ancient Near Eastern history.
