Adadah is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Josh.15.22|Joshua 15:22]], as one of the towns in the southernmost part of Judah's territory, known as the Negev. It is listed along with other towns such as Kabzeel, Eder, and Jagur, suggesting its location was in the arid wilderness region south of Hebron. No other information is provided about Adadah in the Bible, and its exact location is unknown. As part of Judah's inheritance, Adadah would have been settled by members of the tribe of Judah following the conquest of Canaan under Joshua. Its inclusion in the town list in Joshua 15 helps to delineate the extent of Judah's territory in the south.
