Ishvi, also known as Isui, is mentioned in three passages as a son of Asher, who was one of the twelve sons of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) \([[Gen.46.17|Gen.46.17]], [[Num.26.44|Num.26.44]], [[1Chr.7.30|1Ch.7.30]]\). He is listed alongside his brothers Imnah, Ishvah, and Beriah, and his sister Serah. As a grandson of Jacob and great-grandson of Abraham, Ishvi was a member of the Israelite tribe of Asher. 

In [[Num.26.44|Numbers 26:44]], Ishvi is referred to as Isui, which may be an alternate spelling or pronunciation of his name. This passage is part of a census of the Israelites taken in the wilderness, where the clans of Asher are listed according to their ancestors, including Ishvi \(Isui\). 

No additional information is given about Ishvi's life, descendants, or role within the tribe. His inclusion in these genealogies helps to establish the family structure within the tribe of Asher and demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would multiply greatly.
