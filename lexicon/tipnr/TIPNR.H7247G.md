Riblah is mentioned in the Bible as a place on the eastern border of the Promised Land, as described in the book of Numbers. It is listed between Shepham and the Sea of Chinnereth \(Galilee\) \(Num. 34:11\). The exact location of this Riblah is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the region east of the Jordan River, in modern-day Syria or Lebanon. It should not be confused with the more well-known Riblah in the land of Hamath, where the Babylonians set up their headquarters during their campaigns against Judah \(2 Ki. 23:33; 25:6, 20-21; Jer. 39:5-6; 52:9-10, 26-27\).
