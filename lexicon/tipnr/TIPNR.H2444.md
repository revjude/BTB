Hachilah was a hill located in the Wilderness of Ziph, in the region of Judah. It is mentioned in the context of David's flight from King Saul. The Ziphites, who inhabited the area, went to Saul at Gibeah and informed him that David was hiding in the strongholds at Hachilah \([[1Sam.23.19|1 Samuel 23:19]]\). Saul sought David in the Wilderness of Ziph and camped at Hachilah \([[1Sam.26.1|1 Samuel 26:1]], 3\). David learned of Saul's presence and sent out spies to confirm his location. In a daring move, David and Abishai sneaked into Saul's camp at night and took Saul's spear and water jug, demonstrating that he could have killed Saul but chose to spare his life \(1 Samuel 26:4-12\). The hill of Hachilah served as a strategic hideout for David, providing him with a vantage point to monitor Saul's movements and evade capture. The exact location of Hachilah is not specified in the Bible, but it is described as being near the Wilderness of Ziph, which was located in the eastern part of the Judean wilderness.
