Elealeh was a city in the territory of Moab, east of the Jordan River. During the conquest of Canaan, the tribes of Reuben and Gad requested permission to settle in this area due to its suitability for livestock \(Numbers 32:1-5\). Elealeh was one of the cities rebuilt and settled by the Reubenites \([[Num.32.3|Numbers 32:3]],37\). 

However, the prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah later pronounced judgment on Moab, including Elealeh. Isaiah mentioned the city in his oracle against Moab \([[Isa.15.4|Isaiah 15:4]], 16:9\), foretelling that the "weeping of Jazer extends to Elealeh." Jeremiah also predicted that the "lament of Heshbon and Elealeh" would be heard as far as Jahaz \([[Jer.48.34|Jeremiah 48:34]]\). These prophecies indicate that Elealeh would face destruction along with the rest of Moab for their pride and idolatry.
