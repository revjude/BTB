Zeruah was the mother of Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy. She is mentioned in the account of Jeroboam's rise to power in 1 Kings 11. Zeruah was a widow, and her son Jeroboam was an official in Solomon's administration. Jeroboam rebelled against Solomon and fled to Egypt. After Solomon's death, Jeroboam returned and was made king over the ten northern tribes, fulfilling a prophecy given to him by Ahijah the Shilonite. Zeruah's mention in this context highlights Jeroboam's background and family situation.
