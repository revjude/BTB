Joseph is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.42|Ezra 10:42]] as one of the Israelites who had married foreign women during the post-exilic period. After the return from Babylonian captivity, Ezra the scribe led a religious reform in Jerusalem \(Ezra 7-10\). It was discovered that many Israelites, including priests and Levites, had intermarried with the pagan peoples of the land, which was contrary to God's law \(Ezra 9:1-2; Deuteronomy 7:3\). Ezra prayed and confessed the sins of the people \(Ezra 9:3-15\), and the Israelites made a covenant to put away their foreign wives and children \(Ezra 10:1-5\). Joseph was among those listed who had taken foreign wives \([[Ezra.10.42|Ezra 10:42]]\).
