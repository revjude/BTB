Rephidim was one of the places where the Israelites camped during their journey from Egypt to Mount Sinai. It was located in the Wilderness of Sin, after the Israelites left the Wilderness of Sin and before they reached the Wilderness of Sinai \(Exo. 17:1; 19:2; Num. 33:14, 15\). At Rephidim, the people complained about the lack of water, and Moses, following God's instructions, miraculously provided water by striking a rock with his staff \(Exo. 17:1-7\). The Amalekites also attacked the Israelites at Rephidim, but Israel, led by Joshua and aided by Moses' intercession, defeated them \(Exo. 17:8-16\). The exact location of Rephidim is uncertain, but it was likely in the central part of the Sinai Peninsula.
