Ahinoam is mentioned briefly in the Bible as one of the wives of King Saul, the first king of Israel. She was the daughter of Ahimaaz, but no further information is provided about her father. \([[1Sam.14.50|1Sa.14.50]]\) 

Saul had two wives mentioned in the biblical text: Ahinoam and Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. \(2Sa.3.7\) Ahinoam was the mother of several of Saul's children, including his eldest son Jonathan, who became a close friend of David. \(1Sa.14.49\) 

Despite her status as the wife of the king, little is recorded about Ahinoam's life or her role in the royal court. The biblical narrative focuses primarily on Saul's reign, his conflicts with David, and his eventual downfall. 

The mention of Ahinoam in the genealogy of Saul's family establishes her as an important figure in the royal lineage, although her personal character and influence are not elaborated upon in the Bible.
