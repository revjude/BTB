Perga was an ancient city located in the region of Pamphylia, on the southern coast of modern-day Turkey. It is mentioned in the New Testament in connection with Paul's first missionary journey \(Acts 13:13-14; 14:25\). Paul and Barnabas, along with John Mark, sailed from Paphos on the island of Cyprus to Perga in Pamphylia. Upon arriving in Perga, John Mark left the group and returned to Jerusalem \(Acts 13:13\). Paul and Barnabas then traveled north to Antioch in Pisidia, where they preached in the synagogue \(Acts 13:14\). On their return journey, Paul and Barnabas passed through Perga again, preaching the gospel to the city before sailing back to Antioch in Syria \(Acts 14:25\). Although the biblical account does not provide extensive details about their ministry in Perga, it is clear that the city was an important stop on Paul's missionary itinerary and played a role in the spread of Christianity in the region.
