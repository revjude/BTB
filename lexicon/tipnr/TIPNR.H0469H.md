Elizaphan, the son of Parnach, is mentioned as the leader from the tribe of Zebulun appointed to assist in dividing the land of Canaan among the Israelite tribes \([[Num.34.25|Num.34.25]]\). After the Israelites had conquered the land under Joshua's leadership, representatives from each tribe were chosen to oversee the allocation of the land as an inheritance. Elizaphan was selected as the representative for the tribe of Zebulun. His role was to ensure that the land was divided fairly and according to the instructions given by God. The Bible does not provide any additional information about Elizaphan's life or his other responsibilities within the tribe of Zebulun.
