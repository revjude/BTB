Suph is mentioned in Deuteronomy 1:1 as one of the places near the wilderness where Moses spoke to the Israelites. The exact location of Suph is uncertain, but it is listed along with other places such as Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab. These locations are described as being situated "between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab" \(Deut. 1:1\), suggesting that Suph was located somewhere in the Sinai Peninsula or the Negev Desert. Some scholars propose that Suph may be related to the Red Sea \(Yam Suph\), but this connection remains uncertain.
