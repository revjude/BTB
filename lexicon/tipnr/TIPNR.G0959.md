- A woman living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Num.26.44|Act.25.13]]; 
- only referred to as Bernice<[[G0959]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Βερνίκη</span>\).

Bernice was a Jewish princess and the sister of King Agrippa II. She was present with her brother when the apostle Paul made his defense before Agrippa in Caesarea \(Act. 25:13, 23; 26:30\). Bernice and Agrippa were the great-grandchildren of Herod the Great and the children of Herod Agrippa I. As a member of the Herodian dynasty, Bernice held a position of influence and power in the region. Her presence at Paul's hearing demonstrates the attention his case had attracted from the highest levels of society. After listening to Paul's defense, Bernice and Agrippa concluded that he had done nothing deserving of death or imprisonment \(Act. 26:31-32\).
