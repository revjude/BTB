Ophel was a fortified area or hill in Jerusalem, located south of the temple mount. It is mentioned in connection with the construction and repair of Jerusalem's walls during the reigns of Jotham \(2 Chr. 27:3\) and Manasseh \(2 Chr. 33:14\). During the time of Nehemiah, the Ophel was inhabited by the temple servants, known as the Nethinim \(Neh. 3:26; 11:21\). The wall of the Ophel was repaired by the Nethinim and other workers during the rebuilding of Jerusalem's defenses under Nehemiah \(Neh. 3:27\). The Ophel likely served as a strategic and defensive area, protecting the temple complex and the southern part of the city.
