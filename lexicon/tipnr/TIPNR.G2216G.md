Zerubbabel is mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus Christ recorded in Luke 3. He was a descendant of King David and an ancestor of Joseph, the husband of Mary. In the genealogy, Zerubbabel is listed as the son of Shealtiel and the father of Rhesa. This Zerubbabel is likely the same person as the prominent figure who led the first group of exiles back to Jerusalem from Babylon and oversaw the rebuilding of the temple in the 6th century BC. His inclusion in Jesus' genealogy underscores the Messiah's connection to the royal line of David and the fulfillment of God's promises to His people.
