Pau, also referred to as Pai, was a city in the land of Edom, located south of the Dead Sea in modern-day Jordan. It is mentioned twice in the Old Testament, both times in the context of the genealogy of Edomite kings \(Gen. 36:39; 1 Chr. 1:50\). In these passages, Hadar \(or Hadad\) is listed as the king of Edom who died, and Pau is named as the city from which his successor, Mehetabel, came. The name "Pau" or "Pai" is of uncertain meaning and etymology. Apart from these genealogical references, no further information about the city or its history is provided in the Bible. The exact location of Pau remains unknown, as there are no conclusive archaeological findings that can be linked to this ancient Edomite city.
