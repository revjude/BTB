Zechariah, the son of Obadiah, is mentioned as the leader of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Gilead during the reign of King David. The half-tribe of Manasseh, along with Reuben and Gad, settled in the region east of the Jordan River, known as Gilead. Zechariah's role as a leader suggests he had administrative and military responsibilities over the territory and people of Manasseh in Gilead. His father, Obadiah, is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, but Zechariah's leadership position indicates he came from a family of influence within the tribe. The mention of Zechariah in this context highlights the organization and structure of the tribes during David's reign.
