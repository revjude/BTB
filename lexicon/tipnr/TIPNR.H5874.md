En-dor was a Canaanite city located in the territory allotted to the tribe of Manasseh \([[Josh.17.11|Joshua 17:11]]\). However, the Manassites failed to drive out the Canaanites from En-dor, so they continued to live among the Israelites. 

The city is most notable as the place where King Saul sought the counsel of a medium on the eve of his final battle against the Philistines \([[1Sam.28.7|1 Samuel 28:7]]\). Desperate for guidance, Saul disguised himself and visited the medium, requesting her to conjure up the spirit of the deceased prophet Samuel. The medium succeeded, and Samuel's spirit informed Saul that he and his sons would die in battle the next day. 

Psalm 83:10 mentions En-dor in the context of a prayer for God's judgment against Israel's enemies, referring to the defeat of Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River near En-dor \(Judges 4-5\). The city's exact location is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the Jezreel Valley, north of Mount Gilboa.
