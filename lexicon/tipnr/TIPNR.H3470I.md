Jeshaiah is mentioned in the book of Ezra as one of the descendants of Elam who returned to Jerusalem with Ezra. After the Babylonian exile, Ezra led a group of Israelites back to Jerusalem to restore the temple and reinstitute the Law of Moses. Jeshaiah was among this group, which also included priests, Levites, and other Israelites. The mention of Jeshaiah in this context highlights the importance of the return from exile and the restoration of Jewish worship in Jerusalem.
