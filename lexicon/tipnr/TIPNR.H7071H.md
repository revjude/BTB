Kanah and Cana are two distinct places mentioned in the Bible. Kanah was a town that formed part of the boundary of the tribe of Asher, located near Sidon \([[Josh.19.28|Joshua 19:28]]\). It is associated with the modern Wadi Qana, a stream that flows westward into the Mediterranean Sea, just north of Joppa. 

Cana, on the other hand, was a village in Galilee where Jesus performed his first miracle, turning water into wine at a wedding feast \([[John.2.1|John 2:1]], 11\). Jesus later healed a royal official's son from Capernaum while in Cana \([[John.4.46|John 4:46]]\). Nathanael, one of Jesus' disciples, was also from Cana \([[John.21.2|John 21:2]]\). The exact location of Cana is uncertain, but it is generally identified with either Kafr Kanna or Khirbet Qana, both located in the hills of Galilee, not far from Nazareth.
