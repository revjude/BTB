Absalom was the third son of King David, born to Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur \(2Sa. 3:3\). He was known for his handsome appearance and long hair \(2Sa. 14:25-26\). After the rape of his sister Tamar by Amnon, David's firstborn son, Absalom plotted revenge and had Amnon murdered \(2Sa. 13\). He then fled to Geshur for three years before Joab, David's general, arranged for his return \(2Sa. 14\). 

Later, Absalom launched a rebellion against David, proclaiming himself king in Hebron \(2Sa. 15\). David was forced to flee from Jerusalem, and Absalom took advice to pursue him with his forces \(2Sa. 16-17\). However, David's men defeated Absalom's army, and Absalom himself was killed by Joab against David's wishes \(2Sa. 18\). David deeply mourned Absalom's death \(2Sa. 19:1-4\). 

Absalom had erected a pillar to preserve his name, since he had no son to carry on his lineage \(2Sa. 18:18\). He was survived by his daughter Maacah, who later became a wife of Rehoboam and mother of Abijah \(1Ki. 15:2; 2Ch. 11:20-21\).
