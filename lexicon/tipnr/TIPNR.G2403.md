- A queen of the Kingdom of Israel, living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Kgs.16.31|1Ki.16.31]];

- a daughter of Ethbaal **<big>[[H0856|אֶתְבַּעַל]]</big>**; 
- wife of Ahab **<big>[[H0256|אַחְאָב]]</big>**; 
-  mother of Athaliah **<big>[[H6271|עֲתַלְיָה]]</big>**, Joash **<big>[[H3101|יוֹאָשׁ]]</big>**, Ahaziah **<big>[[H0274|אֲחַזְיָה]]</big>** and Joram **<big>[[H3141|יוֹרָם]]</big>**.

Jezebel was the Phoenician princess who became the wife of King Ahab of Israel \([[1Kgs.16.31|1Ki.16.31]]\). She zealously promoted the worship of the Canaanite god Baal and persecuted the prophets of the Lord \([[1Kgs.18.4|1Ki.18.4]],13,19\). Her conflict with the prophet Elijah is notably recorded in 1 Kings 18-19, where Elijah confronts the prophets of Baal and Jezebel threatens Elijah's life. 

Jezebel's wickedness is further demonstrated in her plot to have Naboth killed so that Ahab could seize his vineyard \(1Ki.21\). Her actions led to divine judgment, as pronounced by Elijah \(1Ki.21.23\). 

Years later, during the reign of Ahab's son Joram, Jezebel met her demise as prophesied. Jehu, anointed as king of Israel, had her thrown from a window, and her body was consumed by dogs, fulfilling Elijah's prophecy \([[2Kgs.9.30|2Ki.9.30]]-37\). 

In [[Rev.2.20|Revelation 2:20]], the name "Jezebel" is used symbolically to describe a false prophetess who led people astray in the church of Thyatira, drawing a parallel to the idolatry and immorality promoted by Ahab's queen.
