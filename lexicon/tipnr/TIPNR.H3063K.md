Judah is mentioned in [[Neh.12.36|Nehemiah 12:36]] as one of the priests who participated in the dedication ceremony of the wall of Jerusalem. The context of the passage is the celebration and consecration of the newly rebuilt wall during the time of Nehemiah \(Nehemiah 12:27-43\). 

In verse 36, Judah is listed among the priests who were playing musical instruments, specifically the musical instruments of David, the man of God. These priests were part of the procession that walked on top of the wall, following Ezra the scribe \(Nehemiah 12:35-36\). 

The mention of Judah and the other priests playing musical instruments during the dedication ceremony emphasizes the role of worship and praise in the restoration of Jerusalem and the spiritual renewal of the people. The use of David's musical instruments also connects this celebration to the rich history of Israelite worship.
