Mehuman was one of the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus, the Persian king who ruled over a vast empire from India to Ethiopia. In the book of Esther, King Ahasuerus summoned these seven eunuchs—Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas—to bring Queen Vashti before him during a great feast, so that he could display her beauty to the people and nobles \([[Esth.1.10|Esther 1:10]]-11\). However, Queen Vashti refused to come, leading to her removal as queen and the search for a new queen, which ultimately led to Esther becoming queen. Mehuman's role in this narrative highlights the power and influence of the eunuchs in the Persian court, as they had direct access to the king and were entrusted with carrying out his commands.
