Shallum, mentioned in [[1Chr.4.25|1 Chronicles 4:25]], was the son of Shaul and a descendant of Simeon, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. He is listed in the genealogical records of the Simeonites, which trace the lineage of the tribe. Shallum's father, Shaul, is identified as the son of a Canaanitish woman, indicating that there was some intermarriage between the Simeonites and the Canaanites. No further information about Shallum's life or his role within the tribe is provided in the biblical text. The mention of Shallum in the genealogy serves to highlight the importance of family lineage and the preservation of ancestral records among the Israelites.
