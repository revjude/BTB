Sibmah, also known as Sebam \(Num. 32:3\), was a town located in the territory of Moab, east of the Jordan River. It was initially conquered by the Israelites during their journey to Canaan and allotted to the tribe of Reuben \(Num. 32:38; Josh. 13:19\). The town was known for its lush vineyards, which were celebrated for their productivity and the quality of their grapes. 

The prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah both mention Sibmah in their prophecies concerning the judgment of Moab. Isaiah laments over the destruction of the vineyards of Sibmah, describing how the rulers of the nations have trampled down its vines that once reached as far as Jazer and the wilderness \(Isa. 16:8-9\). Similarly, Jeremiah prophesies that the shouting over the summer fruits and the harvest will cease in the fields of Heshbon and the vineyards of Sibmah \(Jer. 48:32\). 

These prophecies indicate that Sibmah, along with other Moabite towns, would face divine judgment for its pride and idolatry. The destruction of its renowned vineyards symbolizes the extent of the coming devastation and the loss of Moab's prosperity and joy. 

Although the exact location of Sibmah is uncertain, it is believed to have been situated near Heshbon, a prominent Moabite city. The ruins of Qurn el-Kibsh, about 3 miles southwest of Heshbon, have been proposed as a possible site for ancient Sibmah.
