Ribai is mentioned in [[2Sam.23.29|2 Samuel 23:29]] and [[1Chr.11.31|1 Chronicles 11:31]] as the father of Ittai the Gibeathite, who was one of David's mighty men. The mighty men were a group of elite warriors who served under King David and were renowned for their bravery, skill, and loyalty \(2 Samuel 23:8-39; 1 Chronicles 11:10-47\). Ittai, the son of Ribai, was from Gibeah, a town in the territory of Benjamin. He is listed among the mighty men, indicating that he was a valiant warrior who had distinguished himself in battle. The mention of Ribai as Ittai's father suggests that he was also a man of some importance or influence, as his son had risen to a prominent position in David's army. However, no further information is provided about Ribai himself in the biblical text.
