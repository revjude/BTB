Dothan was a place located in the territory of Israel, mentioned in two significant events in the Bible. First, it was the place where Joseph found his brothers tending their flocks after being sent by his father, Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) \(Genesis 37:17\). It was near Dothan that Joseph's brothers sold him into slavery to a caravan of Ishmaelites traveling to Egypt. Later, during the time of the prophet Elisha, the king of Aram sent his army to capture Elisha at Dothan \([[2Kgs.6.13|2 Kings 6:13]]\). God protected Elisha by revealing the presence of heavenly chariots and horses surrounding the city. Dothan was located near the major trade routes between Egypt and Mesopotamia, making it a strategic location for both commercial and military purposes.
