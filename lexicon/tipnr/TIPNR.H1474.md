Golan was a city located in the region of Bashan, east of the Jordan River, within the territory allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh. It was designated as one of the six cities of refuge, along with Kedesh and Hebron \(Deuteronomy 4:43; [[Josh.20.8|Joshua 20:8]]\). These cities served as places of protection for individuals who had unintentionally killed someone, providing them with a safe haven from avengers of blood until a proper trial could be conducted. Golan was also allotted to the Levites of the family of Gershon, along with other cities in the region, as part of their inheritance in the Promised Land \([[Josh.21.27|Joshua 21:27]]; [[1Chr.6.71|1 Chronicles 6:71]]\). This allocation of cities to the Levites ensured that they would be dispersed throughout the land and could carry out their priestly duties among the various tribes of Israel. The region surrounding Golan became known as the territory of Golan or Gaulonitis. Apart from its designation as a city of refuge and a Levitical city, no other specific events or details about Golan are recorded in the Bible.
