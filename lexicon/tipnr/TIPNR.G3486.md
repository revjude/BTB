- A man from the tribe of Judah living at the time ofExile and return, only mentioned at [[Luke.3.25|Luk.3.25]];

Nahum is a name that appears in the genealogy of Jesus Christ, as recorded in the Gospel of Luke \([[Luke.3.25|Luke 3:25]]\). He is listed as the son of Esli and the father of Amos, making him a distant ancestor of Jesus. 

The genealogy in Luke 3 traces Jesus' lineage back through His mother Mary's side of the family, going all the way back to Adam, the first man. This genealogy is distinct from the one found in the Gospel of Matthew, which follows Jesus' lineage through His earthly father Joseph's side of the family. 

Apart from being mentioned in this genealogical record, no additional information is provided about Nahum's life, character, or role in the biblical narrative. His inclusion in the genealogy serves to establish Jesus' connection to the broader human family and to emphasize His role as the Savior of all mankind. 

The name Nahum means "comforter" or "consoler" in Hebrew, although it is unclear whether this meaning has any specific significance in relation to the Nahum mentioned in Jesus' genealogy.
