Joahaz is briefly mentioned in [[2Chr.34.8|2 Chronicles 34:8]] as the father of Joah, who held the position of King Josiah's secretary during the king's reign in Judah. Joah, along with Shaphan the scribe and Maaseiah the governor of the city, was entrusted by Josiah to oversee the distribution of funds to the workers involved in the temple repairs. This event took place in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign, as part of the king's efforts to restore proper worship in Judah.
