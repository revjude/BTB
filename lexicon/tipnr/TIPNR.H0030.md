Priest living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Abihu</span> was a son of Aaron who served as a priest. \([[Exod.6.23|Exo.6.23]]\)
- A priest from the tribe of Levi living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Exod.6.23|Exo.6.23]]; 
- only referred to as Abihu **<big>[[H0030|אֲבִיהוּא]]</big>**; 
-  son of Aaron **<big>[[H0175|אַהֲרוֹן]]</big>** and Elisheba **<big>[[H0472|אֱלִישֶׁבַע]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Nadab **<big>[[H5070|נָדָב]]</big>**, Eleazar **<big>[[H0499|אֶלְעָזָר]]</big>** and Ithamar **<big>[[H0385|אִיתָמָר]]</big>**.

Abihu was the second son of Aaron and Elisheba, and the brother of Nadab, Eleazar, and Ithamar \([[Exod.6.23|Exodus 6:23]]; [[Num.3.2|Numbers 3:2]]\). He was consecrated as a priest along with his brothers to serve at the tabernacle \([[Exod.28.1|Exodus 28:1]]\). Abihu went up Mount Sinai with Moses, Aaron, Nadab and seventy elders of Israel to worship the Lord before He gave the tablets of the Testimony to Moses \([[Exod.24.1|Exodus 24:1]],9\). 

However, Abihu and his brother Nadab offered unauthorized fire before the Lord, and fire came out from the presence of the Lord and consumed them, and they died \([[Lev.10.1|Leviticus 10:1]]-2; [[Num.3.4|Numbers 3:4]]; 26:61\). This occurred on the eighth day of the priests' consecration. Aaron and his surviving sons were not allowed to mourn their deaths \(Leviticus 10:6\). 

The sin of Abihu and Nadab was in offering "strange fire" which the Lord had not commanded \([[Lev.10.1|Leviticus 10:1]]\). This may refer to offering incense that was not prepared according to God's instructions, or performing this in a wrong manner or at an inappropriate time. Their deaths served as a stern warning against improper worship. After this incident, God gave Aaron further regulations for priestly service and conduct \(Leviticus 10:8-11\). The genealogies record Aaron's descendants through his other sons Eleazar and Ithamar, since Nadab and Abihu had no children before their untimely deaths \([[Num.3.4|Numbers 3:4]]; [[1Chr.24.1|1 Chronicles 24:1]]-2\).
