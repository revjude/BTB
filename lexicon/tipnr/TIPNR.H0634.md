Esarhaddon \(681-669 BC\) was the king of Assyria, the son and successor of Sennacherib. He is mentioned in the Bible as the king to whom Sennacherib's assassins escaped after killing their father \([[2Kgs.19.37|2 Kings 19:37]]; [[Isa.37.38|Isaiah 37:38]]\). Esarhaddon is also credited with resettling people in the cities of Samaria \([[Ezra.4.2|Ezra 4:2]]\), which suggests that he was involved in the deportation and relocation of conquered populations, a common practice among Assyrian kings. Historically, Esarhaddon is known for rebuilding Babylon, which his father had destroyed, and for his military campaigns, including the conquest of Egypt.
