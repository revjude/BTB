<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Akan</span> was the son of Ezer, a Horite chief who lived in the land of Seir. \([[1Chr.1.42|1Ch.1.42]]; [[Gen.36.27|Gen.36.27]]\)
- A man living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.36.27|Gen.36.27]]; 
- referred to as Akan **<big>[[H3292|יַעֲקָן]]</big>**, or Akan **<big>[[H6130|עָקָן]]</big>**; 
-  son of Ezer **<big>[[H0687|אֶצֶר]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Bilhan **<big>[[H1092|בִּלְהָן]]</big>** and Zaavan **<big>[[H2190|זַעֲוָן]]</big>**.

Akan is mentioned in the genealogies of the Horites, the inhabitants of Seir, before the Edomites conquered the region. He was the son of Ezer, who was one of the Horite chiefs. \([[Gen.36.27|Gen.36.27]]; [[1Chr.1.42|1Ch.1.42]]\) 

The Horites were the original inhabitants of the mountainous region of Seir, located south of the Dead Sea. They were eventually displaced by the Edomites, the descendants of Esau, who intermarried with the Horites and became the dominant population in the area. \(Deut.2.12\) 

Akan is listed among the sons of Ezer, along with his brothers Bilhan and Zaavan. \([[Gen.36.27|Gen.36.27]]; [[1Chr.1.42|1Ch.1.42]]\) These chiefs and their clans likely held significant influence in the region before the Edomite conquest. 

Apart from being mentioned in the genealogies, no further information is provided about Akan's life, his role as a member of a chiefly family, or any specific events associated with him. 

The inclusion of Akan in the genealogies serves to document the Horite lineage and to provide a historical context for the Edomite occupation of Seir. It also demonstrates the importance of family records and the preservation of ancestral heritage in the ancient Near East.
