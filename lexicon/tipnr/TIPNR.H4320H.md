- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.12.41|Neh.12.41]]; 
- only referred to as Micaiah **<big>[[H4320|מִיכָיָה]]</big>**.

Micaiah is mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as one of the priests who participated in the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem \([[Neh.12.41|Neh.12.41]]\). After the completion of the wall's reconstruction under Nehemiah's leadership, a great celebration was held to dedicate the wall. Two large choirs were appointed to give thanks and walk on top of the wall in opposite directions \(Neh.12.31,38\). Micaiah is listed among the priests who went with the second choir, along with Zechariah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani \([[Neh.12.41|Neh.12.41]]\). These priests blew trumpets as part of the celebration and thanksgiving to God. Micaiah's participation in this event highlights his role as a priest and his involvement in the spiritual life of the Jewish community in the post-exilic period.
