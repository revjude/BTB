Shamir is mentioned in the list of towns allotted to the tribe of Judah in the hill country \(Josh. 15:48\). The town is listed along with other settlements in the region, such as Jattir, Socoh, and Debir. The exact location of Shamir is unknown, but it was situated in the central hill country of Judah, south of Jerusalem. The name "Shamir" is derived from the Hebrew word meaning "thorn" or "flint," possibly indicating the presence of thorny vegetation or rocky terrain in the area. No other information about the town is provided in the biblical text, and its history and significance remain obscure. The mention of Shamir in the territorial allotment of Judah demonstrates the extent of the tribe's inheritance and provides insight into the geographical distribution of settlements in the hill country during the period of the conquest and settlement of Canaan.
