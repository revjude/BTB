Manasseh was the fourteenth king of Judah, succeeding his father, Hezekiah. He began his reign at the age of twelve and ruled for fifty-five years, making him the longest-reigning king of Judah. However, Manasseh's reign was marked by evil and idolatry. He rebuilt the high places that his father had destroyed, erected altars for Baal, and made an Asherah pole. He even sacrificed his own son and practiced sorcery and divination. Manasseh's actions led the people of Judah astray, and they did more evil than the nations that God had destroyed before the Israelites. As a result, God announced judgment on Judah and Jerusalem, stating that He would wipe them out like a dish, turning it upside down. Manasseh also shed much innocent blood, filling Jerusalem from end to end. However, when Manasseh was captured by the Assyrians and taken to Babylon, he humbled himself before God and prayed. God heard his prayer and restored him to Jerusalem, where Manasseh acknowledged the Lord as God and attempted to undo some of the evil he had done. Despite this, the damage to Judah was severe, and the nation continued to face the consequences of Manasseh's sins even after his death. Manasseh was buried in his palace garden, and his son Amon succeeded him as king.
