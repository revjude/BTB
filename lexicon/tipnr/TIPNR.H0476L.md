- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[Jer.36.12|Jer.36.12]]; 
- only referred to as Elishama **<big>[[H0476|אֱלִישָׁמָע]]</big>**.

Elishama the secretary was an official during the reign of King Jehoiakim in Judah \([[Jer.36.12|Jer.36.12]],20,21\). He is mentioned in the context of Jeremiah's prophecies being read before the officials of Judah. When Micaiah reported the words of Jeremiah's scroll to the officials in the secretary's chamber, Elishama was present \([[Jer.36.12|Jer.36.12]]\). Later, when King Jehoiakim demanded to hear the words of the scroll, Jehudi brought the scroll from Elishama's chamber and read it before the king \([[Jer.36.20|Jer.36.20]],21\). Elishama's role as a secretary suggests that he was responsible for record-keeping and administrative duties in the royal court. The Bible does not provide any further details about Elishama's life or his reaction to Jeremiah's prophecies.
