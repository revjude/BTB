Beth-ezel is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the book of Micah, as part of a series of prophetic oracles against the towns and cities of Judah. The name Beth-ezel means "house of rootedness" or "house of proximity" in Hebrew, possibly indicating its close proximity to another significant location. 

In [[Mic.1.11|Micah 1:11]], the prophet declares, "Pass on your way, inhabitants of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame; the inhabitants of Zaanan do not come out; the lamentation of Beth-ezel shall take away from you its standing place." This verse is part of a passage that describes the judgment coming upon various cities in Judah, using wordplay and poetic imagery to convey the message. 

The exact location of Beth-ezel is unknown, but based on the context of Micah's prophecy, it was likely situated in the Shephelah region, the western foothills of Judah, near the Philistine border. The towns mentioned in the surrounding verses, such as Shaphir, Zaanan, and Maroth, are also believed to be in this general area. 

Micah's prophecy suggests that Beth-ezel would be unable to provide support or refuge to the inhabitants of the nearby town of Zaanan during the coming judgment. The phrase "the lamentation of Beth-ezel shall take away from you its standing place" indicates that Beth-ezel itself would be affected by the calamity and unable to offer assistance. 

The prophecy against Beth-ezel and the other towns in Judah serves as a warning of the impending judgment due to the people's sins and a call to repentance and humility before God. The fate of Beth-ezel is tied to the larger narrative of God's judgment against Judah and the surrounding nations.
