Jaaziel, also known as Aziel, is mentioned in [[1Chr.15.18|1 Chronicles 15:18]] and 20 as one of the Levites appointed by David to serve as a musician during the bringing of the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem. He was specifically chosen to play the bronze cymbals \(1Ch.15.19\). 

The transportation of the ark to Jerusalem was a significant event in David's reign, as it symbolized the presence and worship of God in the capital city \(1Ch.15.1-3\). David carefully organized the Levites and assigned them various roles in this process, including carrying the ark, singing, and playing musical instruments \(1Ch.15.16-24\). 

As a musician playing the bronze cymbals, Jaaziel \(Aziel\) would have been part of the joyful celebration and worship that accompanied the ark's journey. The use of musical instruments was an essential aspect of Israelite worship, and the Levites were skilled in their use \(1Ch.15.16\). 

The mention of Jaaziel \(Aziel\) in this context highlights the importance of music and worship in the life of Israel and the specific roles assigned to the Levites in these celebrations. It also demonstrates David's careful attention to the details of worship and his desire to honor God through the proper handling of the ark and the organization of the Levites.
