Ashhur was a descendant of Judah through Hezron, as recorded in the genealogies of 1 Chronicles. He was the son of Hezron, who married Abijah, the daughter of Machir, after the death of Hezron according to the LXX of 1Chr.2.24. Or he was the son of Caleb who married Hezron's widow Ephrath, according one interpretation of the Hebrew of 1Chr.2.24. Ashhur is mentioned as the father \(ie founder\) of Tekoa, which suggests that he was the founder or a prominent figure in the city of Tekoa, located in the hill country of Judah. Ashhur had two wives, Helah and Naarah, who bore him several children. As a descendant of Judah and Caleb, Ashhur was part of an important lineage in the history of Israel.
