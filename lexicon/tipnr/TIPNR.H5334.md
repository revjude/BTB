Nezib was a town in the Judean lowlands \(Shephelah\) that was allotted to the tribe of Judah during the division of the land under Joshua \(Josh. 15:43\). It is mentioned only once in the Bible, along with other towns in the Shephelah, such as Libnah, Ether, and Ashan. The exact location of Nezib is unknown, but it was likely situated in the western foothills of Judah, between the coastal plain and the Judean mountains.
