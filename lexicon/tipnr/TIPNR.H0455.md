Eliahba the Shaalbonite is mentioned in [[2Sam.23.32|2 Samuel 23:32]] and [[1Chr.11.33|1 Chronicles 11:33]] as one of David's mighty men. He was part of an elite group of warriors known for their exceptional military skills and bravery. The mighty men played a crucial role in David's military campaigns and helped establish his kingdom. Eliahba's association with Shaalbon, a town in the territory of Dan, suggests that he may have been from that region.
