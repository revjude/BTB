Man living at the time of United Monarchy

The ark of the covenant was placed on a rock in the field of <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Joshua</span> of Beth-shemesh.
- A man living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Sam.6.14|1Sa.6.14]]; 
- only referred to as Joshua<[[H3091H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>הו</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ש</span>ׁ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ו</span>ּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ַ\).

Joshua is mentioned in [[1Sam.6.14|1 Samuel 6:14]] and 6:18 as a resident of Beth-shemesh, a town in Judah. The context of the passage is the return of the ark of the covenant to Israel after it had been captured by the Philistines \(1 Samuel 4-6\). The Philistines, afflicted by plagues because of the ark's presence, sent it back to Israel on a cart pulled by two cows \(1 Samuel 6:7-12\). 

The cart carrying the ark came to the field of Joshua in Beth-shemesh, where the people were reaping their wheat harvest \(1 Samuel 6:13\). The cows pulling the cart stopped beside a large rock in Joshua's field \([[1Sam.6.14|1 Samuel 6:14]]\). The people of Beth-shemesh then split up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord \([[1Sam.6.14|1 Samuel 6:14]]\). 

The large rock in Joshua's field, where the ark was placed, is mentioned again in [[1Sam.6.18|1 Samuel 6:18]] as a marker or boundary stone.
