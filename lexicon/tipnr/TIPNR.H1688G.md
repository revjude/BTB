Debir is mentioned in [[Josh.15.7|Joshua 15:7]] as a place on the northern border of the tribe of Judah. This Debir is distinct from the more well-known city of Debir, also located in Judah. The exact location of this Debir is uncertain, but it is described as being near the Valley of Achor and the ascent of Adummim. It served as a boundary marker for the territory allotted to Judah during the division of the Promised Land under Joshua.
