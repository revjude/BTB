Ashkelon was one of the five major cities of the Philistines, located along the Mediterranean coast, approximately 35 miles \(56 km\) south of Tel Aviv. It is mentioned several times in the Bible, often in the context of conflict with Israel and as a target of prophetic judgment. 

In [[Judg.1.18|Judges 1:18]], Ashkelon is listed among the cities captured by the tribe of Judah during the conquest of Canaan. However, the city later reverted to Philistine control. [[Judg.14.19|Judges 14:19]] records that Samson, empowered by the Spirit of the Lord, went down to Ashkelon, killed thirty men, and took their garments to pay a debt. 

Ashkelon is mentioned as one of the Philistine cities that received a golden tumor as a guilt offering when the Ark of the Covenant was returned to Israel \([[1Sam.6.17|1 Samuel 6:17]]\). In [[2Sam.1.20|2 Samuel 1:20]], David laments the death of Saul and Jonathan, urging that the news not be proclaimed in Ashkelon, lest the Philistines rejoice. 

Several prophets, including Jeremiah, Amos, and Zephaniah, pronounce judgments against Ashkelon. Jeremiah includes Ashkelon among the nations that will drink the cup of God's wrath \([[Jer.25.20|Jeremiah 25:20]]\) and describes the city as cut off and bereaved \([[Jer.47.5|Jeremiah 47:5]], 7\). Amos prophesies that God will send fire upon Ashkelon \(Amos 1:8\), while Zephaniah declares that Ashkelon will become a desolation \([[Zeph.2.4|Zephaniah 2:4]]\) but also foresees a future restoration \([[Zeph.2.7|Zephaniah 2:7]]\). Zechariah portrays Ashkelon as fearful and mourning in the face of God's judgment \(Zechariah 9:5\). 

Throughout its biblical history, Ashkelon remains a significant Philistine stronghold and a symbol of opposition to Israel. The city's inclusion in prophetic oracles underscores its importance and the divine judgment it would face for its hostility toward God's people.
