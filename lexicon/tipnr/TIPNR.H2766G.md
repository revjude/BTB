Harim was the name of a priestly division during the reign of King David. When David organized the priests into divisions for their service in the temple, the third lot fell to Harim. Members of the Harim division were among the priests who returned from Babylonian exile with Zerubbabel. Some of their descendants, including Maaseiah, married foreign women during the time of Ezra and agreed to put them away. \([[1Chr.24.8|1Ch.24.8]]; [[Ezra.2.39|Ezr.2.39]]; 10.21; [[Neh.7.42|Neh.7.42]]\).
