- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.5.3|Ezr.5.3]]; 
- only referred to as Tattenai **<big>[[H8674|תַּתְּנַי]]</big>**.

Tattenai is mentioned in [[Ezra.5.3|Ezra 5:3]],6 and 6:6,13 as the governor of the province Beyond the River during the reign of Darius king of Persia. When the Jews resumed rebuilding the temple in Jerusalem, Tattenai and his associates questioned their authority to do so and wrote to Darius to investigate the matter. After Darius confirmed Cyrus' decree authorizing the rebuilding, Tattenai allowed the work to continue and even provided support for it from the royal treasury. Tattenai's actions reflect the Persian policy of respecting the religious practices of subject peoples while maintaining oversight of their activities.
