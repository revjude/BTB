Machir was the son of Manasseh, and his daughter's marriage to Hezron, a descendant of Judah, represents an inter-tribal union. She gave birth to a son named Segub. This brief mention in the genealogy of Judah highlights the connection between the tribes of Judah and Manasseh through this marriage.
