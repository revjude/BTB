- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Neh.12.7|Neh.12.7]]; 
- only referred to as Jedaiah<[[H3048I]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>\).

Jedaiah is mentioned in [[Neh.12.7|Nehemiah 12:7]] and 12:21 as one of the priests who returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel, the leader of the first group of exiles to return from Babylon. In verse 7, he is listed among the priests who came back to Jerusalem, indicating his role in the restoration of temple worship and the spiritual life of the community. In verse 21, Jedaiah is mentioned again in the context of the priests who served during the time of Joiakim, the high priest. This suggests that Jedaiah and his descendants continued to serve as priests in the generations following the return from exile. The repeated mention of Jedaiah in the context of the post-exilic priesthood highlights the importance of his family in maintaining the priestly duties and the continuity of temple service.
