- A High Priest from the tribe of Levi living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Exod.6.25|Exo.6.25]];

Phinehas was the son of Eleazar and the grandson of Aaron, the first high priest of Israel \([[Exod.6.25|Exodus 6:25]]\). He is most remembered for his zealous act of killing an Israelite man and a Midianite woman who were engaging in sexual immorality and idolatry, thus turning away God's wrath from the people \([[Num.25.7|Numbers 25:7]]-11\). As a result, God granted Phinehas and his descendants a covenant of perpetual priesthood \(Numbers 25:12-13; Psalm 106:30-31\). 

Phinehas also played important roles in other events. He was sent along with other leaders to confront the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh regarding an altar they had built, which was seen as a potential act of rebellion against God \([[Josh.22.13|Joshua 22:13]]-32\). He served as a priest during the time of the judges and was consulted before the Israelites went to battle against the tribe of Benjamin \([[Judg.20.28|Judges 20:28]]\). 

Phinehas was succeeded by his son Abishua in the line of high priests \(1 Chronicles 6:4-5, 50\). He was remembered as a faithful priest who had charge of the gatekeepers in the tabernacle \([[1Chr.9.20|1 Chronicles 9:20]]\) and was part of Ezra's lineage \([[Ezra.7.5|Ezra 7:5]]; 8:2\).
