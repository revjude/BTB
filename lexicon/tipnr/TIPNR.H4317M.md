Michael is mentioned in the book of 1 Chronicles as one of the Manassites who joined David at Ziklag \([[1Chr.12.20|1Ch.12.20]]\). When David was fleeing from King Saul, a group of warriors from various tribes came to support him. Among them were seven men from the tribe of Manasseh, including Michael, Jozabad, Jediael, Elihu, and Zillethai. These men are described as captains of the thousands of Manasseh, suggesting they held leadership positions within their tribe \([[1Chr.12.20|1Ch.12.20]]\). The Manassites who joined David were skilled warriors and played a significant role in his military campaigns. No further details about Michael's specific role, exploits, or relationship with David are provided in the biblical text. His mention serves to highlight the support David received from various tribes during his time of need.
