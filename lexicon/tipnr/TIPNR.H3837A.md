- only referred to as Laban **<big>[[H3837|לָבָן]]</big>**; 
-  son of Bethuel **<big>[[H1328|בְּתוּאֵל]]</big>**;

Laban was the son of Bethuel and the brother of Rebekah, Isaac's wife \(Gen.24.29\). He lived in Paddan Aram, where he welcomed Abraham's servant who sought a wife for Isaac \(Gen.24.29-51\). Years later, Laban hosted his nephew Israel \(or 'Jacob'\), who fled from his brother Esau \([[Gen.27.43|Gen.27.43]]; 28.2,5\). Laban arranged for Jacob to marry his daughters, Leah and Rachel, in exchange for fourteen years of labor \(Gen.29\). Laban also gave his maidservants, Zilpah and Bilhah, to Jacob as wives \(Gen.30.9,22\). Jacob's wives bore him eleven sons and a daughter while living with Laban \(Gen.29.31-30.24; 46.18,25\). Laban and Jacob had a tense relationship due to Laban's deception and Jacob's prosperity \(Gen.30-31\). After Jacob fled with his family, Laban pursued them but ultimately made a covenant with Jacob before departing \(Gen.31\). Laban is last mentioned when Jacob sent messengers to Esau, stating that he had stayed with Laban \([[Gen.32.4|Gen.32.4]]\).
