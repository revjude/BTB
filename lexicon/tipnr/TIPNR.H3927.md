<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Lemuel</span>, a king whose wise sayings are recorded in Proverbs 31, as taught by his mother \([[1Chr.1.11|Pro.31.1]],4\).
- A king living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Chr.1.11|Pro.31.1]]; 
- only referred to as Lemuel **<big>[[H3927|לְמוּאֵל]]</big>**.

Lemuel is mentioned in the opening verse of Proverbs 31 as a king to whom the sayings in this chapter are attributed \([[1Chr.1.11|Pro.31.1]]\). The chapter contains the words of King Lemuel, which were taught to him by his mother \([[1Chr.1.11|Pro.31.1]]\). In her teaching, Lemuel's mother warns him against giving his strength to women and urges him not to drink wine or strong drink, as it is not fitting for kings \(Pro.31.3-7\). She also instructs him to speak up for the mute, defend the rights of the poor and needy, and judge righteously \(Pro.31.8-9\). The identity and reign of King Lemuel are not specified in the Bible, and he is not mentioned elsewhere in the scriptures. Some scholars suggest that Lemuel may have been a non-Israelite king or a symbolic name representing a wise and righteous ruler. The chapter concludes with a description of a virtuous wife, often referred to as the "Proverbs 31 woman" \([[1Chr.1.11|Pro.31.1]]0-31\).
