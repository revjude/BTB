Adoraim is mentioned in [[2Chr.11.9|2 Chronicles 11:9]] as one of the cities that King Rehoboam, son of Solomon, fortified in the kingdom of Judah. After the division of the kingdom following Solomon's death, Rehoboam strengthened the defenses of Judah by building fortified cities, including Adoraim. These cities were strategically located to protect Judah's borders and key routes from potential attacks by the northern kingdom of Israel or other enemies. 

The exact location of Adoraim is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in the hill country of Judah, possibly southwest of Hebron. The name Adoraim means "two mounds" or "double honor," perhaps referring to the city's topography or its importance. This mention in the context of Rehoboam's fortifications suggests it played a role in the defense of the southern kingdom.
