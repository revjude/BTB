Melatiah the Gibeonite is mentioned in the context of the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls under the leadership of Nehemiah. He was one of the individuals who took responsibility for repairing a specific section of the wall, alongside Jadon the Meronothite and the men of Gibeon and Mizpah \([[Neh.3.7|Nehemiah 3:7]]\). The Gibeonites were descendants of the Hivites who had deceived Joshua into making a treaty with them, and as a result, they were assigned as servants to the Israelites \(Joshua 9\). Melatiah's participation in the rebuilding project demonstrates that the Gibeonites, despite their history, were still involved in the affairs of Israel and contributed to the restoration of Jerusalem in the post-exilic period.
