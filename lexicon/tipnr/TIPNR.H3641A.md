Calneh, also known as Calno, was an ancient city mentioned in the Bible as one of the cities founded by Nimrod in the land of Shinar \([[Gen.10.10|Genesis 10:10]]\). It is also referred to in the prophetic books of Amos \(6:2\) and Isaiah \(10:9\) as a city of significance, and in Ezekiel \(27:23\) as a trading partner of Tyre. 

The exact location of Calneh is uncertain, but it is generally believed to have been situated in Mesopotamia, in the region of Babylonia or Assyria. Some scholars identify it with the ancient city of Kullania or Kullanhu, known from Assyrian inscriptions, which was located near the Tigris River. 

In the Bible, Calneh is mentioned alongside other notable cities such as Babel, Erech, and Accad, suggesting its importance in the ancient Near Eastern world. The prophet Amos used Calneh as an example of a great city that had fallen, warning Israel of impending judgment \(Amos 6:2\). Similarly, Isaiah mentioned Calneh in the context of Assyria's conquests and its arrogance against God \([[Isa.10.9|Isaiah 10:9]]\). 

Ezekiel's reference to Calneh as a trading partner of Tyre \([[Ezek.27.23|Ezekiel 27:23]]\) indicates that the city was involved in commercial activities and had established economic ties with other major centers in the region. 

Although the biblical references to Calneh are brief, they suggest that it was a city of considerable significance in ancient Mesopotamia, known for its political, economic, and cultural importance. Its association with Nimrod and its mention alongside other prominent cities underscore its place in the early history of human civilization.
