Gomer is mentioned in the Table of Nations \([[Gen.10.2|Genesis 10:2]]-3, [[1Chr.1.5|1 Chronicles 1:5]]-6\) as one of the sons of Japheth, the son of Noah. He is listed alongside his brothers Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. Gomer is also named as the father of three sons: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. The descendants of Gomer are believed to have settled in the region around the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, possibly in the area of modern-day Turkey, Armenia, and parts of Eastern Europe. In [[Ezek.38.6|Ezekiel 38:6]], Gomer is mentioned along with Beth-togarmah as one of the allies of Gog, a future enemy of Israel. This suggests that the descendants of Gomer were still recognized as a distinct people group during the time of Ezekiel's prophecy. Some scholars have proposed a connection between Gomer and the ancient Cimmerians, a nomadic people who inhabited the region north of the Black Sea in the 8th and 7th centuries BC, but this identification remains uncertain.
