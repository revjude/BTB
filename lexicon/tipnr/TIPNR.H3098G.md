Joah, the son of Asaph, was a high-ranking official in King Hezekiah's court, serving as the king's secretary. He is mentioned in the context of the Assyrian invasion of Judah during Hezekiah's reign. When the Assyrian envoys came to Jerusalem to demand the city's surrender, Joah was one of the three officials sent by Hezekiah to meet with them \([[2Kgs.18.18|2Ki.18.18]]; [[Isa.36.3|Isa.36.3]]\). Along with Eliakim and Shebna, Joah sought to negotiate with the Assyrians and asked them to speak in Aramaic rather than Hebrew, so the people on the wall would not understand \([[2Kgs.18.26|2Ki.18.26]]; [[Isa.36.11|Isa.36.11]]\). After the Assyrian envoys delivered their threatening message, Joah and his colleagues reported back to Hezekiah, tearing their clothes in distress \([[2Kgs.18.37|2Ki.18.37]]; [[Isa.36.22|Isa.36.22]]\).
