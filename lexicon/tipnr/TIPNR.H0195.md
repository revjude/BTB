The Ulai is a river mentioned in the Book of Daniel, located in the ancient region of Elam, near the city of Susa \(Dan. 8:2\). In Daniel's vision, he finds himself beside the Ulai Canal, where he sees a ram with two horns standing beside the river \(Dan. 8:3\). The ram is later interpreted as representing the kings of Media and Persia \(Dan. 8:20\). As the vision continues, Daniel sees a male goat coming from the west, which defeats the ram \(Dan. 8:5-7\). The goat is interpreted as the king of Greece \(Dan. 8:21\). The Ulai River is mentioned again when the angel Gabriel approaches Daniel to explain the vision \(Dan. 8:16\). The river's location in Elam, combined with the mention of Susa, suggests that the Ulai may be associated with the ancient city of Susa, which served as one of the capitals of the Persian Empire. The Ulai River is thus connected with important prophetic visions in the Book of Daniel, which foretell the rise and fall of major world empires and their impact on God's people.
