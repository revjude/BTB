Shemaiah is mentioned in [[Jer.36.12|Jeremiah 36:12]] as one of the officials present in the chamber of Elishama the scribe during the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah. When Micaiah reported to the officials about the scroll containing Jeremiah's prophecies, which had been read by Baruch, Shemaiah was among those who listened to the report. The officials then sent Jehudi to retrieve the scroll from Baruch and read it in their presence. This event led to King Jehoiakim burning the scroll and ordering the arrest of Jeremiah and Baruch. Shemaiah's presence in the chamber suggests that he held a position of some importance within the royal court, although his specific role is not elaborated upon in the text.
