- A priest from the tribe of Levi  living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[1Chr.9.12|1Ch.9.12]]; 
- referred to as Adiel **<big>[[H5717|עֲדִיאֵל]]</big>**, or Azarel \(KJV= Azareel\)  **<big>[[H5832|עֲזַרְאֵל]]</big>**;

Adiel, also known as Azarel, was a priest who lived in Jerusalem during the post-exilic period, as recorded in the books of 1 Chronicles and Nehemiah \([[1Chr.9.12|1 Chronicles 9:12]]; [[Neh.11.13|Nehemiah 11:13]]\). He was a descendant of Immer, one of the priestly families that returned to Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. 

In the context of 1 Chronicles 9 and Nehemiah 11, Adiel is mentioned among the priests who settled in Jerusalem and served in the temple. These chapters provide lists of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, including the priests and Levites who were responsible for the spiritual leadership of the community. 

As a priest, Adiel would have been involved in the various duties associated with temple service, such as offering sacrifices, teaching the law, and maintaining the sacred space. His presence in Jerusalem during this time indicates his commitment to the restoration of the city and the re-establishment of the temple cult. 

The variation in Adiel's name between 1 Chronicles and Nehemiah \(Azarel in Nehemiah\) is not uncommon in biblical genealogies and may be due to differences in spelling, pronunciation, or the use of alternative names for the same individual. 

No additional information is provided about Adiel's personal life, his family, or any specific events or challenges he may have faced as a priest in post-exilic Jerusalem. His mention in the lists of priests serves to document the continuity of the priestly lineage and the importance of their role in the spiritual life of the community.
