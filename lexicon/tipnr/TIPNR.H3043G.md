Benjamin was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, and this chapter provides a genealogical record of his descendants. Jediael is listed along with his brothers Bela and Becher as the three sons of Benjamin. The text further states that Jediael had three sons: Bilhan, Jeush, and Benjamin. The descendants of Jediael are described as mighty warriors and expert archers, numbering 17,200 men ready for battle. This information suggests that Jediael's clan was known for its military prowess and played a significant role in the tribe of Benjamin.
