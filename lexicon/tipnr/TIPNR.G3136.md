Martha was a woman from Bethany who, along with her siblings Mary and Lazarus, was a close friend of Jesus. When Jesus visited their home, Martha welcomed Him and busied herself with serving, while her sister Mary sat at Jesus' feet, listening to His teachings. Martha complained to Jesus that Mary was not helping her, but Jesus gently reminded her that Mary had chosen the better part by focusing on His words \([[Luke.10.38|Luke 10:38]]-42\). Later, when Lazarus fell ill and died, Martha went out to meet Jesus and expressed her faith in Him, saying that if He had been there, her brother would not have died. Jesus reassured her that Lazarus would rise again and proclaimed Himself as the resurrection and the life \([[John.11.1|John 11:1]]-44\). After Lazarus was raised from the dead, Martha served a meal for Jesus and His disciples, demonstrating her love and gratitude \([[John.12.2|John 12:2]]\).
