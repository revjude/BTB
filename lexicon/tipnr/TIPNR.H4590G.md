Maaziah was a priest who served as the head of the 24th division of priests during the reign of King David \([[1Chr.24.18|1Ch.24.18]]\). As part of David's organization of the priesthood, the priests were divided into 24 divisions, each responsible for serving in the temple for a specific period \(1Ch.24.1-19\). Maaziah's division was the 24th in the order of service. The establishment of this system ensured a structured and orderly approach to the priestly duties in the temple. No further details are provided about Maaziah's personal life or his specific responsibilities as the head of his division. His inclusion in the list of priestly divisions highlights the importance of the priesthood in maintaining the religious life of ancient Israel.
