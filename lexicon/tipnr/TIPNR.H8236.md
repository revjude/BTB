Shiphrah is mentioned in [[Exod.1.15|Exodus 1:15]] as one of the two Hebrew midwives, along with Puah, who were ordered by the king of Egypt to kill any male children born to Hebrew women. However, Shiphrah and Puah feared God and did not follow Pharaoh's command. Instead, they allowed the male children to live. When questioned by Pharaoh about why they let the boys live, they cleverly replied that Hebrew women gave birth quickly before the midwives could arrive. Because of their faith and courage, God blessed Shiphrah and Puah, giving them families of their own. Their actions were instrumental in preserving the lives of Hebrew boys, including Moses, who would later lead the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt.
