Eliehoenai is mentioned in [[Ezra.8.4|Ezra 8:4]] as one of the descendants of Pahath-Moab who returned to Jerusalem with Ezra. During the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia, Ezra led a group of exiles back to Jerusalem to restore worship and reinforce the Jewish community \(Ezra 7:1-10\). Eliehoenai was part of this group, which included various families and individuals from different tribes and backgrounds. The mention of Eliehoenai in this list highlights the diverse composition of the returnees and their shared commitment to rebuilding Jerusalem and the temple.
