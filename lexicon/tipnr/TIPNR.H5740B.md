Eder was a town situated in the Negev, the southern region of the territory allocated to the tribe of Judah. It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the list of towns and villages belonging to Judah \([[Josh.15.21|Joshua 15:21]]\). The exact location of Eder is unknown, but it was likely located in the arid wilderness south of Hebron. As one of the towns in the Negev, Eder would have faced the challenges of limited water resources and harsh desert conditions.
