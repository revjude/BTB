<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Crescens</span>, a companion of Paul, went to Galatia during Paul's imprisonment. \([[2Tim.4.10|2Ti.4.10]]\)
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[2Tim.4.10|2Ti.4.10]]; 
- only referred to as Crescens<[[G2913]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Κρήσκης</span>\).

Crescens is mentioned briefly in [[2Tim.4.10|2 Timothy 4:10]] as one of Paul's companions who had left him during his imprisonment in Rome. Paul states that Crescens had gone to Galatia, a region in Asia Minor where Paul had previously ministered and established churches. The reason for Crescens' departure is not specified, but it is possible that he went to Galatia to continue ministry work or to attend to personal matters. 

Paul's mention of Crescens, along with others who had left him, highlights the challenges and loneliness he faced during his final imprisonment. Despite this, Paul remained committed to his faith and the spread of the gospel.
