Berothah, also known as Berothai or Cun, is mentioned in both Ezekiel's prophetic vision and in the historical accounts of King David's reign. In [[Ezek.47.16|Ezekiel 47:16]], the city is described as one of the landmarks defining the northern border of Israel in the future division of the land. The verse places Berothah between the territories of Hamath and Damascus. In [[2Sam.8.8|2 Samuel 8:8]] and [[1Chr.18.8|1 Chronicles 18:8]], Berothai is mentioned as one of the cities from which King David took a large amount of bronze after defeating Hadadezer, the king of Zobah. The city is called Cun in [[1Chr.18.8|1 Chronicles 18:8]], which may be an alternative name or a scribal variation. The exact location of Berothah/Berothai/Cun is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the region of Zobah, a kingdom to the north of Israel. The city's mention in both prophetic and historical contexts suggests that it was a significant place during the time of the Old Testament.
