Ben-ammi is mentioned in [[Gen.19.38|Genesis 19:38]] as the son of Lot's younger daughter, born after the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The context of the passage is the account of Lot's daughters, who, believing they were the only survivors, decided to have children by their father to preserve their family line. The younger daughter conceived and gave birth to a son, whom she named Ben-ammi, meaning "son of my people." The text states that Ben-ammi became the ancestor of the Ammonites, a neighboring nation to Israel. The Ammonites are later mentioned throughout the Old Testament, often in conflict with the Israelites. The story of Ben-ammi's birth highlights the consequences of Lot's choice to live in Sodom and the moral decline of his family. It also serves as an origin story for the Ammonite people and their relationship to the Israelites.
