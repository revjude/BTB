Tabbath is mentioned in [[Judg.7.22|Judges 7:22]] as a place near the Jordan River where the Midianites fled after being defeated by Gideon and his three hundred men. After Gideon's surprise attack on the Midianite camp, the Midianites fled in panic, running towards the Jordan River. The pursuit led them to the area of Beth-shittah, Abel-meholah, and Tabbath. The exact location of Tabbath is not specified, but it is mentioned in the context of the Israelites' victory over the Midianites during the time of the judges.
