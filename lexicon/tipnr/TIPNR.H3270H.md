The Jazer Sea is a poetic expression used by the prophet Jeremiah in his lament over Moab \(Jeremiah 48:32\). In this passage, Jeremiah mourns the destruction of Moab and its renowned vineyards, particularly those of Jazer. The phrase "Sea of Jazer" is a metaphorical reference to the abundance and fertility of the vineyards in the region of Jazer. It emphasizes the extent and significance of the vineyards, comparing them to a vast sea. This poetic language highlights the devastating impact of the destruction of these vineyards on the people of Moab and the region's economy.
