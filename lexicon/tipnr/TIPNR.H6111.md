Azmon is mentioned in [[Num.34.4|Numbers 34:4]]-5 and [[Josh.15.4|Joshua 15:4]] as a place along the southern border of the land allotted to the tribe of Judah. It is described as being part of the border that extended from the southern end of the Dead Sea, through the Wilderness of Zin, and along the border of Edom. The exact location of Azmon is uncertain, but it was likely situated somewhere in the Negev desert region, south of Kadesh-barnea.
