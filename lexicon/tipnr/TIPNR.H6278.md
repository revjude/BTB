Eth-kazin is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Josh.19.13|Joshua 19:13]], as part of the description of the border of the territory allotted to the tribe of Zebulun. The verse states that the border "turned eastward to Gath-hepher, to Eth-kazin, and went out to Rimmon, which stretches to Neah." 

The exact location of Eth-kazin is uncertain, but it was situated near the towns of Gath-hepher and Neah, likely in the region of Lower Galilee. The name Eth-kazin may be derived from the Hebrew words "eth," meaning "time," and "kazin," meaning "to cut off," possibly referring to a place where some event or decision took place.
