- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.23|Ezr.10.23]]; 
- referred to as Kelaiah<[[H7041]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ק</span>ֵ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>\), or Kelita<[[H7042H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ק</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יט</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>\).

Kelaiah, also known as Kelita, is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.23|Ezra 10:23]] as one of the Levites who had married foreign women during the time of Ezra. The context of the passage is Ezra's reform, where he addressed the issue of intermarriage between the Israelites and the pagan peoples of the land \(Ezra 9-10\). 

Kelaiah is listed among the Levites who had taken foreign wives \([[Ezra.10.23|Ezra 10:23]]\). As part of the covenant made by the people to put away their foreign wives and children, Kelaiah would have been required to separate from his foreign wife \(Ezra 10:10-11\). 

The name Kelaiah is used interchangeably with Kelita in this passage, indicating that they refer to the same person. The use of both names may suggest that Kelaiah was his given name, while Kelita was a surname or an alternative name. 

Apart from this mention in the context of Ezra's reform, no other information is provided about Kelaiah's background, specific role, or the circumstances surrounding his marriage to a foreign woman.
