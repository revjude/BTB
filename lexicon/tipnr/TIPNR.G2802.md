Cauda, also known as Clauda or Gavdos, is mentioned once in the Bible, in Acts 27:16. During Paul's journey to Rome as a prisoner, the ship he was on encountered a severe storm. As they were being driven along by the wind, they passed to the south of a small island called Cauda. 

The crew used this brief respite from the storm to secure the ship's lifeboat and undergird the ship with ropes to strengthen it against the battering waves \(Acts 27:16-17\). This measure was taken to prevent the ship from being run aground on the nearby Syrtis Sands, a notorious sandbar off the coast of North Africa. 

Cauda is a small island located south of Crete in the Mediterranean Sea. It provided a brief moment of shelter for Paul's ship during the storm, allowing the crew to make necessary preparations before continuing their perilous journey to Rome.
