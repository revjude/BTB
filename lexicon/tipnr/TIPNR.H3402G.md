Jarib is mentioned in [[Ezra.8.16|Ezra 8:16]] as one of the leaders sent by Ezra to the place called Casiphia to find Levites and Temple servants to bring back to Jerusalem. After returning from the Babylonian exile, Ezra was tasked with reestablishing proper worship in the Temple. To accomplish this, he needed Levites to perform the necessary duties. Ezra sent Jarib, along with other leaders, to Casiphia, where there was a community of Levites. The text does not provide any further details about Jarib's life or his specific role in this mission. However, his inclusion in the list of leaders suggests that he was a trusted and capable individual who could help Ezra in his efforts to restore the Temple worship.
