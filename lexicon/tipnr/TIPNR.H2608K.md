Hananiah is mentioned in [[Neh.12.41|Nehemiah 12:41]] as one of the priests who played the trumpet during the dedication ceremony of the rebuilt wall of Jerusalem. After the completion of the wall under Nehemiah's leadership, a great celebration was held to dedicate the wall and give thanks to God. The priests and Levites were divided into two groups, each walking in opposite directions on top of the wall. They were accompanied by choirs singing and playing instruments, including trumpets. Hananiah was among the seven priests who played the trumpets during this joyous occasion. The trumpets were used in religious ceremonies and to signal important events. The mention of Hananiah in this context highlights the significance of music and the role of priests in leading the people in worship and celebration.
