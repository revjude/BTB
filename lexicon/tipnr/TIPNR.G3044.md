Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Linus</span>, a Christian in Rome to whom Paul sent greetings \([[2Tim.4.21|2Ti.4.21]]\).
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[2Tim.4.21|2Ti.4.21]]; 
- only referred to as Linus<[[G3044]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Λίνος</span>\).

Linus was a Christian who lived in Rome during the time of Paul's second imprisonment \([[2Tim.4.21|2Ti.4.21]]\). In Paul's second letter to Timothy, he asked Timothy to greet Linus, along with other believers such as Eubulus, Pudens, and Claudia. This suggests that Linus was a member of the Christian community in Rome and likely known to both Paul and Timothy. Some early church traditions identify Linus as the second bishop of Rome, succeeding Peter, but this cannot be confirmed from the biblical text alone.
