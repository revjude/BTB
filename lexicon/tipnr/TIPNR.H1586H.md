Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim, was the wife of the prophet Hosea, as mentioned in [[Hos.1.3|Hosea 1:3]]. God commanded Hosea to marry Gomer, who was described as a promiscuous woman or a prostitute, to illustrate Israel's unfaithfulness to God. Gomer bore Hosea three children: Jezreel, Lo-ruhamah, and Lo-ammi, whose names were symbolic of God's judgment and rejection of Israel due to their disobedience. Despite Gomer's continued unfaithfulness, Hosea was commanded to love her and redeem her, just as God continued to love and seek to redeem Israel. The story of Hosea and Gomer serves as an allegory of God's relationship with Israel, emphasizing God's steadfast love and mercy in the face of Israel's sin and disobedience.
