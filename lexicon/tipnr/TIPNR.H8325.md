Sharar \(or Sachar\), mentioned in [[2Sam.23.33|2 Samuel 23:33]] and [[1Chr.11.35|1 Chronicles 11:35]], was the father of Ahiam, one of the mighty men who served in King David's army. The name Sharar is used in 2 Samuel, while Sachar is used in 1 Chronicles, likely due to textual variations or scribal differences. Ahiam is described as one of the mighty men, a group of skilled warriors who demonstrated exceptional bravery and loyalty to David throughout his military campaigns. They were renowned for their strength, courage, and military expertise. The text does not provide any specific details about Sharar's life or his role in his son's upbringing. However, the mention of Sharar as Ahiam's father suggests that he was a significant figure, possibly known for his own accomplishments or the family's reputation. The inclusion of Ahiam in the list of David's mighty men highlights the importance of these warriors in establishing and maintaining David's kingdom.
