Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Arah</span>, whose daughter was married to Shechaniah, was the father-in-law of Tobiah the Ammonite.
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.5|Ezr.2.5]]; 
- only referred to as Arah<[[H0733H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ח</span>\).

Arah is mentioned in Nehemiah 6:18 as the father-in-law of Tobiah the Ammonite, who opposed Nehemiah's efforts to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. Arah's daughter was married to a man named Shechaniah, and this marriage alliance created a connection between Tobiah and some of the Jewish nobles. This relationship complicated Nehemiah's efforts to restore and protect Jerusalem, as Tobiah used his influence to undermine Nehemiah's authority.
