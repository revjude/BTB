Zechariah was an Israelite who lived during the time of Ezra the scribe, after the return from the Babylonian exile. He was among the men who had married foreign women, which was contrary to God's law. When Ezra called the people to repentance and required them to separate from their foreign wives, Zechariah was one of those listed as having done so. This act demonstrated his willingness to obey God's commands and purify the community.
