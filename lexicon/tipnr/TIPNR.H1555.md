Goliath was a Philistine warrior from the city of Gath who fought against the Israelites during the reign of King Saul. He is described as a giant, standing at six cubits and a span \(approximately 9 feet 9 inches or 3 meters\) tall, and wearing heavy bronze armor \([[1Sam.17.4|1 Samuel 17:4]]-7\). Goliath challenged the Israelites to send a champion to face him in single combat, but no one dared to accept the challenge until David, a young shepherd, volunteered. With a sling and a stone, David defeated Goliath, striking him on the forehead and killing him \([[1Sam.17.4|1 Samuel 17:4]]8-50\). David then cut off Goliath's head with the giant's own sword \(1 Samuel 17:51\). This event is significant in David's life, as it marked the beginning of his rise to prominence in Israel. The sword of Goliath was kept as a trophy, and David later retrieved it from the tabernacle at Nob when he was fleeing from Saul \([[1Sam.21.9|1 Samuel 21:9]], 22:10\). In [[2Sam.21.19|2 Samuel 21:19]] and [[1Chr.20.5|1 Chronicles 20:5]], there is mention of another Goliath, also from Gath, who was killed by Elhanan, one of David's warriors. Some scholars believe this may refer to a brother or relative of the Goliath killed by David.
