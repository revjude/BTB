Zibeon was a Hivite man mentioned in the book of Genesis as the grandfather of Oholibamah, one of Esau's wives. Esau, the son of Isaac and the twin brother of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\), married Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, who was the daughter of Zibeon. This marriage is significant because it shows the intermarriage between the Israelites and the Canaanite tribes, such as the Hivites. The Bible provides no further information about Zibeon beyond his role as the grandfather of Esau's wife, but his inclusion in the genealogy highlights the complex family relationships and cultural interactions during the time of the patriarchs.
