- People from Shiphm\(?\), only mentioned at [[1Chr.27.27|1Ch.27.27]];

The Shiphmites are mentioned in [[1Chr.27.27|1 Chronicles 27:27]] as the people from Siphmoth who were responsible for overseeing King David's vineyards. This chapter lists the various officials and administrators responsible for managing the king's assets and resources. The Shiphmites, led by Zabdi, were tasked with the cultivation, maintenance, and production of the royal vineyards. Siphmoth, their place of origin, is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, but it was likely a town or region known for its vineyards and wine production. The fact that the Shiphmites were entrusted with this responsibility suggests that they had expertise in viticulture and were reliable in their duties.
