Jeshaiah is mentioned in 1 Chronicles as one of the sons of Jeduthun, a Levite and one of the chief musicians appointed by King David to serve in the tabernacle choir. Jeduthun, along with Asaph and Heman, was responsible for leading the music and praise in the tabernacle. Jeshaiah, along with his brothers, was a skilled musician and singer, and he was appointed by lot to serve in the choir. The mention of Jeshaiah in this context highlights the importance of music and worship in ancient Israelite culture and the role of the Levites in facilitating these practices.
