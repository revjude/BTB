Naamah is mentioned in [[Gen.4.22|Genesis 4:22]] as the daughter of Lamech and his wife Zillah, and the sister of Tubal-cain. In some traditions she became the wife of Noah. She appears in the genealogy of Cain, which traces the descendants of Adam and Eve's firstborn son. 

In the context of the passage, Lamech is portrayed as a powerful and violent man, known for his polygamy and his boastful speech about his acts of vengeance \(Genesis 4:19-24\). Naamah's brother, Tubal-cain, is described as a craftsman skilled in making tools of bronze and iron. 

The mention of Naamah in this genealogy is unusual, as women are rarely named in such lists unless they play a significant role in the narrative. However, no further details are provided about Naamah's life, character, or accomplishments.
