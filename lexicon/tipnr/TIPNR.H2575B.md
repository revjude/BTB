Hammath is mentioned in [[1Chr.2.55|1 Chronicles 2:55]] as one of the Kenite clans descended from Salma, the  father \(ie founder\) of Bethlehem. The Kenites were a nomadic tribe closely associated with the Israelites, particularly during the time of Moses and the Exodus. Some Kenites, such as Jethro \(Moses' father-in-law\), played important roles in Israel's history. The mention of Hammath in the genealogy of Judah suggests that this Kenite clan had integrated with the tribe of Judah and settled in or near Bethlehem.
