Ithamar was the fourth and youngest son of Aaron, the first high priest of Israel \([[Exod.6.23|Exo.6.23]]\). He served as a priest alongside his brothers Nadab, Abihu, and Eleazar \([[Num.3.2|Num.3.2]]\). After the deaths of Nadab and Abihu for offering unauthorized fire before the Lord \(Lev.10.1-2\), Ithamar and Eleazar were warned not to mourn for them openly \([[Lev.10.6|Lev.10.6]]\). 

Ithamar assisted his father Aaron and his brother Eleazar in their priestly duties \([[Exod.28.1|Exo.28.1]]; [[Num.3.4|Num.3.4]]\). He was responsible for overseeing the Gershonites and Merarites, two of the Levite clans, in their tabernacle duties \([[Num.4.28|Num.4.28]],33\). During the dedication of the tabernacle, Ithamar assisted Moses in receiving the offerings from the tribal leaders \([[Num.7.8|Num.7.8]]\). 

Ithamar's descendants continued to serve as priests \([[1Chr.24.1|1Ch.24.1]]-6\). They were divided into divisions for their appointed duties, just as Aaron's other descendants were. One of Ithamar's notable descendants was Eli, who served as high priest and judge in Israel \(1Sa.14.3; 1Ki.2.27\). 

In [[Ezra.8.2|Ezra 8:2]], a descendant of Ithamar named Daniel is mentioned among the priests who returned to Jerusalem from the Babylonian exile. This highlights the continuity of Ithamar's lineage in the priesthood.
