Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, was a false prophet during the reign of King Ahab of Israel. When Ahab sought advice about attacking Ramoth-gilead, Zedekiah, along with other prophets, encouraged the king to go to war, promising victory. He made iron horns and symbolically declared that Ahab would gore the Syrians. However, the prophet Micaiah contradicted their message, prophesying Ahab's defeat and death. Zedekiah struck Micaiah and accused him of lying. Micaiah responded by saying that Zedekiah would hide in an inner chamber when his false prophecy was revealed. Ahab listened to Zedekiah and the other false prophets, leading to his death in battle.
