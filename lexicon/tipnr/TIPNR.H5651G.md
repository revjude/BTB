Ebed is mentioned in the book of Judges as the father of Gaal, a man who opposed Abimelech's rule over Shechem. Abimelech was a son of Gideon, the judge who had delivered Israel from the Midianites. 

After Gideon's death, Abimelech killed his seventy brothers and established himself as king over Shechem \(Judges 9:1-6\). However, Gaal son of Ebed arrived in Shechem and gained the trust of the people \([[Judg.9.26|Judges 9:26]]\). Gaal openly challenged Abimelech's authority, questioning his claim to rule over the city \([[Judg.9.28|Judges 9:28]]\). 

When Zebul, the ruler of the city and a supporter of Abimelech, heard of Gaal's words, he sent messengers to warn Abimelech \([[Judg.9.30|Judges 9:30]]-31\). Abimelech then devised a plan to attack the city and confront Gaal and his followers \(Judges 9:32-33\). 

In the ensuing battle, Abimelech defeated Gaal and his supporters, driving them out of the city \([[Judg.9.35|Judges 9:35]]-41\). Abimelech later destroyed the city and sowed it with salt, symbolizing its complete destruction \(Judges 9:45\). 

While Ebed himself is not mentioned beyond being identified as Gaal's father, his son's actions played a significant role in the narrative of Abimelech's reign and downfall. The story of Gaal's rebellion highlights the tensions and power struggles that existed during the period of the judges, as well as the consequences of Abimelech's ruthless ambition.
