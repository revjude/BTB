Janai is mentioned in [[1Chr.5.12|1 Chronicles 5:12]] as one of the leaders from the tribe of Gad who settled in the region of Bashan, along with his fellow leaders Joel, Shapham, and Shaphat. The Gadites are described as mighty warriors, famous men, and heads of their families. They settled in the land of Gilead in Bashan, extending as far as Salecah, due to the abundance of pasture for their livestock. This settlement likely took place during the early period of Israel's history, after the conquest of Canaan and the allocation of tribal territories.
