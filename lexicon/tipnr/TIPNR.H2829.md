Heshmon was a town located in the Negev region, the southern part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Judah. It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Josh.15.27|Joshua 15:27]], as part of the list of towns and villages in the southland of Judah. 

In the context of Joshua 15, the chapter describes the boundaries and cities of Judah's inheritance in the Promised Land. The list of towns is divided into several geographical regions, including the Negev, the lowland, and the hill country. 

Heshmon is listed among other towns in the Negev, such as Moladah, Hazar-gaddah, Hazar-shual, and Beersheba. The exact location of Heshmon is uncertain, as it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in other historical sources. 

The name "Heshmon" is derived from the Hebrew root meaning "fatness" or "fertility," which may suggest that the town was situated in a relatively fertile area within the Negev region, known for its arid climate. 

The mention of Heshmon in the biblical text serves to provide a detailed account of the cities and villages allotted to the tribe of Judah and to underscore the fulfillment of God's promise to give each tribe a portion of the Promised Land as an inheritance. Its inclusion in the list also highlights the importance of geographical accuracy and attention to detail in the recording of Israel's history and the allotment of the land.
