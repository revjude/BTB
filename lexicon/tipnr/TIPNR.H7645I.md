Shebaniah \(or Shecaniah\), mentioned in [[Neh.10.4|Nehemiah 10:4]] and 12:14, was a priest who served during the time of Nehemiah. In Nehemiah 10, Shebaniah is listed among the priests who signed the covenant document, pledging to follow God's law and to support the temple service. This act of commitment demonstrates Shebaniah's dedication to the religious reforms and his willingness to take an active role in the spiritual life of the community. In Nehemiah 12, Shebaniah is mentioned in the context of the genealogies of the priests and Levites who returned from the Babylonian exile. He is identified as the head of a priestly family during the time of Joiakim, the high priest. The inclusion of Shebaniah in these lists highlights the importance of the priestly lineage and the continuity of the priestly service in the post-exilic period. The text does not provide any further details about Shebaniah's specific duties or achievements as a priest.
