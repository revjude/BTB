Gilead, the son of Machir and grandson of Manasseh, is mentioned in several genealogical lists in the Old Testament. In Numbers 26:29-30, he is identified as the ancestor of the Gileadite clans, which included Iezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Shemida, and Hepher. These clans are also mentioned in Joshua 17:1-2, where they are described as receiving an inheritance in the land of Canaan. In [[Num.27.1|Numbers 27:1]] and [[Josh.17.3|Joshua 17:3]], Gilead's great-granddaughters, the daughters of Zelophehad, appeal to Moses for the right to inherit their father's property in the absence of male heirs. This incident leads to a change in the inheritance laws, allowing daughters to inherit property when there are no male heirs \(Numbers 27:2-11\). In [[1Chr.2.21|1 Chronicles 2:21]]-23 and 7:14-17, Gilead is mentioned in the genealogies of Manasseh, confirming his role as a significant ancestor of the tribe. The repeated mentions of Gilead in these genealogical lists highlight the importance of family lineage and tribal identity in ancient Israelite society.
