-  son of Elioenai<[[H0454B]]>; 
- a brother of Eliashib<[[H0475G]]>, Pelaiah<[[H6411B]]>, Akkub<[[H6126G]]>, Johanan<[[H3110I]]>, Delaiah<[[H1806G]]> and Anani<[[H6054]]>.

Hodaviah, also known as Hodaiah, is mentioned in [[1Chr.3.24|1 Chronicles 3:24]] as one of the descendants of King David through the line of Jeconiah \(also known as Jehoiachin\). Jeconiah was one of the last kings of Judah before the Babylonian exile, and his descendants are listed in the genealogy found in 1 Chronicles 3. 

In the genealogy, Hodaviah is listed twice as one of the seven sons of Elioenai, who was a descendant of Jeconiah through Shealtiel and Zerubbabel. The repetition of his name in the genealogy may suggest that he was an important figure in the family line or that there were two individuals with the same name. 

The name Hodaviah means "praise Yahweh" or "Yahweh is my praise," while Hodaiah is a variant of the same name. 

Apart from being mentioned in this genealogy, no other information is provided about Hodaviah or Hodaiah in the Bible. However, his inclusion in the lineage of David suggests that he was part of an important family line that continued after the Babylonian exile and may have played a role in the restoration of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the temple.
