Malchi-shua was one of the sons of King Saul, the first king of Israel. He was a brother of Jonathan, Abinadab, and Ishvi. Malchi-shua fought alongside his father and brothers in the battles against the Philistines. In a fierce battle on Mount Gilboa, the Philistines overwhelmed the Israelite army. Malchi-shua, along with his brothers Jonathan and Abinadab, was killed in the battle. King Saul, upon seeing his sons dead and facing imminent capture, took his own life by falling on his sword \([[1Sam.14.49|1 Samuel 14:49]]; 31:2; [[1Chr.8.33|1 Chronicles 8:33]]; 9:39; 10:2\).
