- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.3.30|Neh.3.30]];

Hanun is mentioned in [[Neh.3.30|Nehemiah 3:30]] as one of the individuals who repaired a section of Jerusalem's wall during the rebuilding project led by Nehemiah. He is identified as the sixth son of Zalaph, distinguishing him from the Hanun mentioned in Nehemiah 3:13, who repaired the Valley Gate. Hanun, along with Hananiah, the son of Shelemiah, repaired another section of the wall. The specific location of their repair work is not mentioned, but it is clear that they were part of the collective effort to restore Jerusalem's defenses. The mention of Hanun in this context highlights the participation of individuals and families in the rebuilding process, each taking responsibility for a portion of the work. It also demonstrates the importance of unity and cooperation in achieving a common goal.
