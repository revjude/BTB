Ahoah, also known as Ahohi, was a descendant of Benjamin and the ancestor of the Ahohite clan. The Ahohites were a family within the tribe of Benjamin known for their military prowess and loyalty to King David. 

Several of David's mighty men, an elite group of warriors who fought alongside him, were identified as Ahohites. Eleazar, the son of Dodo, was an Ahohite who stood with David against the Philistines at Pas-dammim. He fought until his hand was weary and clung to his sword, and the Lord brought about a great victory that day. \([[2Sam.23.9|2Sa.23.9]]-10; [[1Chr.11.12|1Ch.11.12]]-14\). 

Another Ahohite, Zalmon, is mentioned among David's mighty men, known as "the thirty." \([[2Sam.23.28|2Sa.23.28]]; [[1Chr.11.29|1Ch.11.29]]\) 

The Ahohites' military skill and bravery were not limited to David's reign. During the time of King Solomon, Dodai the Ahohite was the commander of the division for the second month, overseeing 24,000 men. \([[1Chr.27.4|1Ch.27.4]]\) 

The repeated mention of Ahohites among David's mighty men and Solomon's military leaders highlights the clan's reputation as skilled warriors and their enduring loyalty to the Davidic dynasty.
