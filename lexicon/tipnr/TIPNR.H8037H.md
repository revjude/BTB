Shamma, mentioned in [[1Chr.7.37|1 Chronicles 7:37]], was a descendant of Asher, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. He is identified as the son of Zophah, indicating his place within the genealogy of the tribe of Asher. The text provides a list of Asher's descendants, tracing the lineage through several generations. Shamma's mention in this genealogical record serves to highlight the importance of family lines and the preservation of tribal identity. No further details about Shamma's life or his role within the tribe are provided in the biblical text. The inclusion of his name in the genealogy suggests that he was a recognized member of the tribe of Asher and contributed to the continuation of the family line.
