Jehiel is mentioned in [[2Chr.31.13|2 Chronicles 31:13]] as one of the Levites appointed by King Hezekiah to oversee the distribution of offerings and tithes in the temple. This chapter describes Hezekiah's reforms and his efforts to restore proper worship and support for the priests and Levites. Jehiel is listed along with other Levites such as Azaziah, Nahath, and Benaiah, who were chosen to serve as officers and overseers in the temple. Their role was to ensure that the contributions from the people were properly collected, stored, and distributed to the priests and Levites according to their divisions. The text does not provide any further details about Jehiel's background or his specific duties in this role. However, his appointment by Hezekiah suggests that he was a trusted and capable Levite who could handle the important task of managing the temple's resources and supporting the religious leaders of the nation.
