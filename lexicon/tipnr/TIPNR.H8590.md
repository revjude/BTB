Taanach, also known as Aner, was a Canaanite city located in the territory allotted to the tribe of Manasseh \(Josh. 12:21; 17:11\). However, the Manassites did not drive out the Canaanites from Taanach, and instead put them to forced labor \(Judg. 1:27\). Taanach was later designated as a Levitical city given to the Kohathite clan \(Josh. 21:25; 1 Chr. 6:70\). The city is mentioned in the song of Deborah as the site of a battle against the Canaanite king Jabin and his commander Sisera \(Judg. 5:19\). It was also included in the administrative district overseen by Baana, one of Solomon's twelve officers \(1 Kgs. 4:12\). The strategic location of Taanach, near the intersection of important trade routes, made it a significant city in the region.
