- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Rev.2.13|Rev.2.13]]; 
- only referred to as Antipas **<big>[[G0493|Ἀντίπας]]</big>**.

Antipas is mentioned in the book of Revelation as a faithful witness of Christ who was martyred in the city of Pergamum. In the letter to the church in Pergamum, Jesus acknowledges the difficult circumstances the believers faced, living in a city "where Satan's throne is." Despite the intense persecution, Antipas remained faithful to Christ, even to the point of death. Jesus commends the church for holding fast to His name and not denying their faith, even in the face of martyrdom, as exemplified by Antipas. This brief mention of Antipas serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made by early Christians and the importance of remaining faithful to Christ in the face of adversity.
