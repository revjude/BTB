Akrabbim, meaning "scorpions," is mentioned in [[Num.34.4|Numbers 34:4]] and [[Josh.15.3|Joshua 15:3]] as a geographic feature that marked the southern border of the Promised Land and the tribe of Judah. It is described as an ascent or pass, likely located in the Negev region. The exact location of Akrabbim is not certain, but it is believed to be in the vicinity of the Dead Sea and the Zin Desert. The pass served as an important boundary marker for the Israelites as they prepared to enter and divide the land of Canaan.
