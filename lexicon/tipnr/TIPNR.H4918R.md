Meshullam, the son of Berechiah, is mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as one of the individuals who helped repair the wall of Jerusalem during Nehemiah's time \([[Neh.3.4|Neh.3.4]],30\). He worked on two sections of the wall, one near the Fish Gate and another near his own house. Meshullam's involvement in the wall reconstruction demonstrates his commitment to the restoration of Jerusalem and the security of its inhabitants. Later in the book, it is mentioned that Meshullam's son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Sanballat the Horonite, one of Nehemiah's main adversaries \([[Neh.6.18|Neh.6.18]]\). This family connection may have complicated Meshullam's role in the ongoing political tensions surrounding the rebuilding of Jerusalem, but no further details are provided in the biblical text.
