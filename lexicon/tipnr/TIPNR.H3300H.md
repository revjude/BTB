Jaasiel, the son of Abner, is mentioned in [[1Chr.27.21|1 Chronicles 27:21]] as the leader of the half-tribe of Manasseh during King David's reign. This passage lists the leaders of the tribes of Israel who served in David's administration, with each leader responsible for overseeing their tribe's affairs for one month out of the year. 

As the leader of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Jaasiel would have been responsible for managing the tribe's resources, organizing its military forces, and representing its interests before the king. The fact that he is identified as the son of Abner suggests that he may have been related to Saul's military commander, Abner, who initially opposed David but later supported him \(2Sa.3.6-21\). However, the text does not provide any further details about this relationship or Jaasiel's background. 

Jaasiel's inclusion in this list of tribal leaders demonstrates David's effective organization of his kingdom and his ability to delegate authority to capable individuals from various tribes. It also highlights the importance of the tribe of Manasseh within the kingdom of Israel. 

No other information is given about Jaasiel's specific actions or achievements as a tribal leader. His mention in this context serves to illustrate the structure and administration of David's kingdom.
