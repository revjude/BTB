Joiada is mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as a high priest who served during the Persian period. He was the son of Eliashib and the father of Jonathan \([[Neh.12.10|Neh.12.10]],11\). Joiada is listed in the genealogy of the high priests, indicating his legitimate claim to the office. 

During Joiada's tenure as high priest, the priests and Levites were recorded according to their genealogies \([[Neh.12.22|Neh.12.22]]\). This suggests that he oversaw the organization and administration of the temple personnel. 

In [[Neh.13.28|Nehemiah 13:28]], it is revealed that one of Joiada's sons had married a daughter of Sanballat the Horonite, who was a prominent opponent of Nehemiah and the Jewish community. This marriage was seen as a violation of the covenant made by the Jews to separate themselves from foreign influences \(Neh.10.30\). Nehemiah responded by driving the offending son away from the community. 

Joiada's high priesthood was marked by the ongoing challenges of maintaining religious purity and identity in the face of external pressures and influences. His son's marriage to a foreign woman highlights the difficulties faced by the Jewish community in preserving their distinct faith and culture during this period.
