Maaseiah was a servant of King Josiah of Judah who was involved in the repair and restoration of the temple \([[2Chr.34.8|2Ch.34.8]]\). During Josiah's reign, a book of the Law was discovered in the temple, prompting the king to initiate religious reforms and repairs to the temple \(2Ch.34.1-33\). Maaseiah, along with Shaphan the secretary and Joah the recorder, was sent by Josiah to Hilkiah the high priest to assess the money collected for the temple repairs and to oversee the work. This demonstrates Maaseiah's trusted position within the royal court and his involvement in the religious and administrative affairs of the kingdom. The restoration of the temple and the rediscovery of the Law were significant events in Josiah's reign, leading to a renewed commitment to the worship of God and the observance of His commandments.
