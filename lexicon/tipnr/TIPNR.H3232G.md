Man living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Imnah</span> was a son of Asher and the ancestor of the Imnite clan within the tribe of Asher.
- A man from the tribe of Asher living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Gen.46.17|Gen.46.17]]; 
- referred to as Imnah or Imnite **<big>[[H3232|יִמְנָה]]</big>**; 
-  son of Asher **<big>[[H0836|אָשֵׁר]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Ishvah **<big>[[H3438|יִשְׁוָה]]</big>**, Ishvi **<big>[[H3440|יִשְׁוִי]]</big>**, Beriah **<big>[[H1283|בְּרִיעָה]]</big>** and Serah **<big>[[H8294|שֶׂרַח]]</big>**.

Imnah is mentioned in [[Gen.46.17|Genesis 46:17]], [[Num.26.44|Numbers 26:44]], and [[1Chr.7.30|1 Chronicles 7:30]] as one of the sons of Asher, who was one of the twelve sons of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) \(Israel\). Asher was the founder of the tribe of Asher, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. 

In the genealogy of Genesis 46, which records the descendants of Jacob who went down to Egypt, Imnah is listed as one of the sons of Asher, along with his brothers Ishvah, Ishvi, and Beriah, and his sister Serah. 

In Numbers 26, during the census of the Israelites in the wilderness, the descendants of Imnah are referred to as the Imnites. This indicates that Imnah's descendants formed a clan within the tribe of Asher. 

The census in Numbers 26 was taken after the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness for 40 years and were preparing to enter the Promised Land. The purpose of the census was to determine the military strength of each tribe and to allocate the land inheritance accordingly. 

In [[1Chr.7.30|1 Chronicles 7:30]], Imnah is again mentioned in the genealogy of the tribe of Asher, confirming his status as one of the sons of Asher and the progenitor of the Imnite clan. 

These genealogical records in Genesis, Numbers, and Chronicles serve to establish the family lines and tribal affiliations of the Israelites, highlighting the importance of lineage and inheritance in ancient Israelite society.
