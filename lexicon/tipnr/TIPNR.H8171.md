Shaalim is mentioned briefly in the Bible as a region through which Saul and his servant passed while searching for Saul's father's lost donkeys \(1 Sam. 9:4\). The passage states that they went through the hill country of Ephraim and the land of Shalishah, but did not find the donkeys. They then passed through the land of Shaalim and the land of Benjamin, still without success. The exact location of Shaalim is unknown, but it was likely situated in the central hill country of Israel, north of Jerusalem. The mention of Shaalim in this narrative serves to highlight the extent of Saul's search for the donkeys and the various regions he traversed before encountering the prophet Samuel, who would anoint him as the first king of Israel. The fact that Shaalim is mentioned only once in the Bible, and without any further details, suggests that it was a relatively obscure or minor region in the landscape of ancient Israel.
