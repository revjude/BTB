<small>*Male • Son of Hadlai • Ephraimite leader who opposed enslaving Judahite captives*</small>

Man living at the time of Divided Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Amasa</span>, along with other leaders of Ephraim, opposed the Israelite army's attempt to bring Judahite captives as slaves to Samaria. \([[2Chr.28.12|2Ch.28.12]]\)
- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[2Chr.28.12|2Ch.28.12]]; 
- only referred to as Amasa **<big>[[H6021|עֲמָשָׂא]]</big>**; 
- a son of Hadlai **<big>[[H2311|חַדְלַי]]</big>**.

Amasa is mentioned in the context of the conflict between the kingdoms of Israel and Judah during the reign of King Ahaz of Judah. Ahaz's unfaithfulness to God led to Judah's defeat by Israel and their allies, resulting in the capture of many Judahites. \(2Ch.28.5-8\) 

As the Israelite army was returning to Samaria with the captives and plunder, a prophet named Oded confronted them, warning that God's anger was against Israel for their own sins. He urged them to release the captives, as they were their own kinsmen. \(2Ch.28.9-11\). 

In response, several leaders of Ephraim, including Amasa, stood up against the army and refused to allow them to bring the captives into the city. They recognized the guilt of Israel and the potential for further divine wrath. \([[2Chr.28.12|2Ch.28.12]]-13\) 

Amasa and the other leaders then provided for the captives, clothing and feeding them, and returning them to Jericho, a city in Judah. \(2Ch.28.14-15\) 

This act of compassion and solidarity demonstrated by Amasa and the other Ephraimite leaders was a rare moment of unity and repentance.
