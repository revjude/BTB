Man living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Evi</span> was one of the Midianite kings killed by the Israelites during the time of Moses.
- A man living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Num.31.8|Num.31.8]]; 
- only referred to as Evi<[[H0189]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>ֱ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ו</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>\).

Evi was one of the five kings of Midian who were defeated and killed by the Israelites during the time of Moses \([[Num.31.8|Numbers 31:8]]\). These kings were allies of the Moabites and had played a role in leading the Israelites into idolatry and sexual immorality \(Numbers 25:1-9\). As a result, God commanded Moses to take vengeance on the Midianites \(Numbers 31:1-2\). Evi and the other Midianite kings were slain in battle, along with Balaam the son of Beor \([[Num.31.8|Numbers 31:8]]\). The Midianite kings, including Evi, are also mentioned as having been defeated by the Israelites in [[Josh.13.21|Joshua 13:21]], where they are described as "princes of Sihon" and "rulers in the land."
