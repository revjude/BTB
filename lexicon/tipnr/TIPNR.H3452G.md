Jeshimon is a wilderness area mentioned in the Bible, located near the town of Ziph in the Judean Desert. It is described as a place where David sought refuge from King Saul, who was pursuing him. The Ziphites, inhabitants of Ziph, informed Saul about David's hiding place in the strongholds of Jeshimon \([[1Sam.23.19|1 Samuel 23:19]]\). Saul searched for David in the wilderness of Ziph and Jeshimon \([[1Sam.23.24|1 Samuel 23:24]]\), and later camped in Jeshimon when pursuing David \([[1Sam.26.1|1 Samuel 26:1]], 3\). The exact location of Jeshimon is not certain, but it is believed to be in the eastern part of the Judean Desert, near the Dead Sea.
