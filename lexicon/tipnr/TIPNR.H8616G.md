Tikvah, also referred to as Tokhath, is mentioned in [[2Kgs.22.14|2 Kings 22:14]] and [[2Chr.34.22|2 Chronicles 34:22]] as the father of Shallum. Shallum was the husband of Huldah, a prophetess who lived in Jerusalem during the reign of King Josiah. When Josiah ordered the repair of the temple, the high priest Hilkiah discovered the Book of the Law. Josiah then sent a delegation, including Shallum, to consult Huldah regarding the words of the book. Huldah prophesied that God would bring judgment upon Judah for their unfaithfulness but that Josiah would be spared because of his repentance. No other details are provided about Tikvah's life or role. His mention serves to identify Shallum and, by extension, Huldah, who played a significant role in Josiah's religious reforms.
