The East Gate was one of the gates in the wall of Jerusalem, mentioned in the book of Nehemiah. It was located on the eastern side of the city, near the house of Shemaiah, the son of Shechaniah, who was the keeper of the East Gate \([[Neh.3.29|Nehemiah 3:29]]\). Shemaiah was responsible for repairing the section of the wall adjacent to his house, which included the East Gate. The exact location and appearance of the East Gate are not described in detail, but it likely provided access to the eastern part of Jerusalem and the Kidron Valley. The East Gate may have been an important entry point for those coming from the Mount of Olives and the surrounding areas east of the city. Its mention in Nehemiah's account of the rebuilding of the walls highlights the collective effort of the people to restore and fortify Jerusalem's defenses.
