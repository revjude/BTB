Pedaiah was a descendant of King Jehoiachin \(also known as Jeconiah\) of Judah, according to [[1Chr.3.18|1 Chronicles 3:18]]-19. He was born during the Babylonian captivity after Jehoiachin was deposed and exiled by Nebuchadnezzar. Pedaiah's brothers included Shealtiel, Malchiram, and Shenazzar. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel, who led the first group of exiles back to Jerusalem. However, [[1Chr.3.19|1 Chronicles 3:19]] also lists Zerubbabel as the son of Pedaiah, suggesting that Pedaiah may have been Zerubbabel's legal father, possibly due to a levirate marriage.
