Jehozadak, also known as Jozadak, was the father of Joshua, the high priest who served during the time of the Babylonian exile and the return to Jerusalem. Jehozadak was the son of Seraiah, the high priest who was executed by Nebuchadnezzar when Jerusalem fell. Jehozadak was taken into captivity in Babylon, where his son Joshua was born. After the exile, Joshua returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel and helped to rebuild the temple and restore the worship of God. Jehozadak is mentioned in the genealogies of the high priests and in the accounts of the rebuilding of the temple.
