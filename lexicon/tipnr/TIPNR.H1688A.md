Debir, also referred to as Kiriath-sannah or Kiriath-sepher, was a Canaanite city located in the hill country of Judah. It was conquered by Joshua during the initial Israelite conquest of Canaan \([[Josh.10.38|Joshua 10:38]]-39; 11:21; 12:13\). Later, Caleb offered his daughter Achsah in marriage to whoever would capture Debir, and Othniel, Caleb's nephew, successfully took the city \([[Josh.15.15|Joshua 15:15]]-16; [[Judg.1.11|Judges 1:11]]-12\). The city was also known as Kiriath-sannah, meaning "city of palm," and Kiriath-sepher, meaning "city of books," possibly indicating it was a center of learning. After its capture, Debir was allotted to the priests \([[Josh.21.15|Joshua 21:15]]; [[1Chr.6.58|1 Chronicles 6:58]]\).
