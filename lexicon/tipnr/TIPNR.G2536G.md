Cainan is mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus Christ recorded in the Gospel of Luke \([[Luke.3.36|Luke 3:36]]\). He is listed as the son of Arphaxad and the father of Shelah. This genealogy traces Jesus' lineage back to Adam, emphasizing His humanity and connection to the ancestral line of the Israelites. Cainan's inclusion in this genealogy is notable because he is not mentioned in the genealogies found in Genesis 11 and 1 Chronicles 1, which list Shelah as the direct son of Arphaxad. Some scholars suggest that the name Cainan may have been added to Luke's genealogy based on the Septuagint \(Greek Old Testament\) translation, which includes Cainan in Genesis 11. The presence of Cainan in Luke's genealogy highlights the importance of genealogical records in establishing Jesus' lineage and fulfilling messianic prophecies.
