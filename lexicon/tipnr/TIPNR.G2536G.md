Man living at the time of the Patriarchs

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Cainan</span>, the son of Arphaxad, was an ancestor of Jesus Christ according to Luke's genealogy.
- A man living at the time of the Patriarchs, only mentioned at [[Luke.3.36|Luk.3.36]]; 
- only referred to as Cainan **<big>[[G2536|Καϊνάν]]</big>**; 
- a son of Arpachshad **<big>[[H0775|אַרְפַּכְשַׁד]]</big>**; 
-  father of Shelah **<big>[[H7974|שֶׁלַח]]</big>**.

Cainan is mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus Christ recorded in the Gospel of Luke \([[Luke.3.36|Luke 3:36]]\). He is listed as the son of Arphaxad and the father of Shelah. This genealogy traces Jesus' lineage back to Adam, emphasizing His humanity and connection to the ancestral line of the Israelites. Cainan's inclusion in this genealogy is notable because he is not mentioned in the genealogies found in Genesis 11 and 1 Chronicles 1, which list Shelah as the direct son of Arphaxad. Some scholars suggest that the name Cainan may have been added to Luke's genealogy based on the Septuagint \(Greek Old Testament\) translation, which includes Cainan in Genesis 11. The presence of Cainan in Luke's genealogy highlights the importance of genealogical records in establishing Jesus' lineage and fulfilling messianic prophecies.
