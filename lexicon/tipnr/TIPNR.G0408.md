<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Andronicus</span>, along with Junia, was a fellow prisoner with Paul and was noted as outstanding among the apostles.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Rom.16.7|Rom.16.7]]; 
- only referred to as Andronicus **<big>[[G0408|Ἀνδρόνικος]]</big>**.

Andronicus is mentioned by Paul in his letter to the Romans as one of his fellow prisoners and kinsmen. Along with Junia, Andronicus is described as being "outstanding among the apostles" and having been "in Christ" before Paul himself. This suggests that Andronicus and Junia were well-known and respected members of the early Christian community, possibly having been converted to Christianity before Paul's own conversion. Paul's greeting to them in his letter indicates a close relationship and high regard for their faith and service in the gospel.
