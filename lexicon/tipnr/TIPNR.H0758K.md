Aram-maacah \(or Maacah\) was a small Aramean kingdom located near Mount Hermon, north of Israel. During the reign of King David, the Ammonites hired soldiers from Aram-maacah and other Aramean kingdoms to help fight against Israel \([[1Chr.19.6|1 Chronicles 19:6]]-7\). The Aramean forces, including the army of Maacah, gathered at the city of Medeba. Joab, David's commander, defeated the Aramean coalition, and the Arameans made peace with Israel \(1 Chronicles 19:8-19\). No other details are provided about the kingdom of Aram-maacah, its rulers, or its later history. The region of Maacah is also mentioned in other contexts, sometimes referring to a person or an Israelite clan \(Deuteronomy 3:14, Joshua 12:5\).
