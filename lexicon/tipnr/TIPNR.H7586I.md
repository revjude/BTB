King living at the time of the Patriarchs

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Shaul</span>, from Rehoboth on the Euphrates, was a king of Edom who reigned after Samlah and before Baal-hanan.
- An Edomite king living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.36.37|Gen.36.37]]; 
- referred to as Shaul or Shaul<[[H7586I]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ש</span>ָׁ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>או</span>ּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>\).

Shaul, mentioned in [[Gen.36.37|Genesis 36:37]]-38 and [[1Chr.1.48|1 Chronicles 1:48]]-49, was one of the kings of Edom, a neighboring nation to Israel. He is described as being from Rehoboth on the Euphrates, which suggests that he may have had ties to the region of Mesopotamia. Shaul reigned as king after the death of Samlah and was succeeded by Baal-hanan, the son of Achbor. The text does not provide any details about the length of Shaul's reign or his specific achievements as king. The mention of Shaul in the lists of Edomite kings highlights the succession of rulers in Edom and provides a historical context for the relationship between Edom and Israel. The fact that Shaul is identified by his place of origin, Rehoboth on the Euphrates, sets him apart from the other Edomite kings and may indicate the extent of Edom's political or commercial connections during his reign.
