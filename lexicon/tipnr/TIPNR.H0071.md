The Abana River is mentioned in [[2Kgs.5.12|2 Kings 5:12]] as one of the two rivers of Damascus, along with the Pharpar. When Elisha told Naaman, commander of the army of Syria, to wash in the Jordan River to cure his leprosy, Naaman initially refused, saying, "Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?" The Abana was apparently a significant and highly regarded river near Damascus. Naaman considered it superior to the Jordan River of Israel. After his servants reasoned with him, Naaman relented and washed in the Jordan as instructed, and his leprosy was cured. The Abana River is generally identified with the modern Barada River, the primary river that flows through Damascus.
