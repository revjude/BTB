Adaiah was a priest who served in the house of God during the post-exilic period in Jerusalem. He was a descendant of Malchijah, who was one of the priestly families \([[1Chr.9.12|1 Chronicles 9:12]]; [[Neh.11.12|Nehemiah 11:12]]\). Adaiah is mentioned in the lists of priests who resided in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. 

In the genealogy of the priests in 1 Chronicles 9, Adaiah is listed as the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malchijah \([[1Chr.9.12|1 Chronicles 9:12]]\). This genealogy emphasizes the priestly lineage and the continuity of the priestly service in the temple after the exile. 

[[Neh.11.12|Nehemiah 11:12]] mentions Adaiah as one of the priests who lived in Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah. He is described as the son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malchijah. 

Adaiah's inclusion in these lists highlights the importance of the priestly families in the restoration of the temple and the religious life of the Jewish community after the Babylonian exile.
