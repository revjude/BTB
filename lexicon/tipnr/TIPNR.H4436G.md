Queen living at the time of United Monarchy

The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Queen of Sheba</span> visited King Solomon, tested him with questions, and praised his wisdom and prosperity.
- A queen of the country Sheba<[[H7614J]]> living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Kgs.10.1|1Ki.10.1]]; 
- referred to as Queen\_of\_Sheba<[[H4436G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>מ</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>כ</span>ָּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>\), or Queen/ of the South<[[G0938H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>βασίλισσα</span>\).

The Queen of Sheba, whose kingdom was likely located in modern-day Yemen or Ethiopia, heard about the fame and wisdom of King Solomon and traveled to Jerusalem to meet him \([[1Kgs.10.1|1 Kings 10:1]]-13; [[2Chr.9.1|2 Chronicles 9:1]]-12\). She brought a large entourage and expensive gifts, including gold, spices, and precious stones. The queen tested Solomon with difficult questions, and he answered them all, demonstrating his God-given wisdom. Impressed by his wisdom, wealth, and the organization of his court, the Queen of Sheba praised Solomon and his God, acknowledging that his wisdom and prosperity were divine blessings. She gave Solomon many gifts, and he reciprocated, giving her all she desired. Jesus later referenced the Queen of Sheba's visit, noting that she came from the ends of the earth to hear Solomon's wisdom, and yet someone greater than Solomon was present in Jesus himself \([[Matt.12.42|Matthew 12:42]]; [[Luke.11.31|Luke 11:31]]\).
