Ephrathah is a name closely associated with Bethlehem, the city in Judah where David and Jesus were born. In several passages, Bethlehem is referred to as "Bethlehem Ephrathah" \(Rut.1.2; [[1Sam.17.12|1Sa.17.12]]\), indicating that Ephrathah was either an alternate name for the city or a region encompassing it. 

The name Ephrathah is also mentioned in the genealogies of Judah in connection with Caleb, a prominent figure in the tribe. Ephrathah is listed as the wife of Caleb \([[1Chr.2.19|1Ch.2.19]]\), and their descendants, including Hur and Salma, are associated with the founding or settlement of Bethlehem \([[1Chr.2.50|1Ch.2.50]]; 4.4\). 

The dual usage of the name Ephrathah suggests a possible link between the person and the place, although the exact nature of this connection is not explicitly stated in the Bible. The association of Ephrathah with Bethlehem highlights the significance of this city in Israel's history, as it was the birthplace of key figures like David and Jesus.
