Man living at the time of the Patriarchs

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Tidal</span>, king of Goiim, was one of the four kings allied with Chedorlaomer in the battle against the five kings of the plain.
- A man living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.14.1|Gen.14.1]]; 
- only referred to as Tidal **<big>[[H8413|תִּדְעָל]]</big>**.

Tidal, described as king of Goiim, is mentioned in [[Gen.14.1|Genesis 14:1]] and 14:9 as one of the four kings who joined forces with Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, in a battle against the five kings of the cities of the plain, including Sodom and Gomorrah. The name "Tidal" is of uncertain origin, and "Goiim" may refer to a region or a group of people. In the biblical account, Tidal and his allies engaged in a military campaign in Canaan, ultimately defeating the five kings and taking captives, including Abraham's nephew Lot. In response, Abraham and his 318 trained men pursued the victorious kings, defeated them, and rescued Lot and the other captives \([[Gen.14.1|Genesis 14:1]]4-16\). No other details are provided about Tidal's background, the extent of his kingdom, or his fate after the battle. His participation in the alliance with Chedorlaomer suggests a significant political and military role in the ancient Near East, but the exact historical and geographical context remains uncertain.
