Addi is mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus Christ recorded in the Gospel of Luke \([[Luke.3.28|Luke 3:28]]\). He is listed as the son of Cosam and the father of Melchi, and he appears in the lineage between David and Joseph, the husband of Mary. 

The genealogy in Luke traces Jesus' ancestry back to Adam, the first man, highlighting His connection to all of humanity. The inclusion of Addi in this genealogy demonstrates the importance of family lineage and the continuity of God's plan throughout history. 

However, little is known about Addi beyond his mention in the genealogy. The Bible does not provide any additional information about his life, his occupation, or his role in the family line. His name is not mentioned in any other biblical passages or historical records. 

The presence of Addi in the genealogy of Jesus serves to affirm the historical reality of Christ's human ancestry and His connection to the Davidic line. It also emphasizes the faithfulness of God in preserving the lineage of the Messiah throughout the generations, from Abraham to David, and ultimately to Jesus Christ. 

As with many of the individuals mentioned in biblical genealogies, Addi's significance lies primarily in his place within the larger narrative of God's redemptive plan, rather than in the details of his personal life or achievements.
