- A Syrian king living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Sam.8.9|2Sa.8.9]]; 
- referred to as Toi or Tou **<big>[[H8583|תֹּעוּ]]</big>**; 
-  father of Joram **<big>[[H3141|יוֹרָם]]</big>**.

Toi, also referred to as Tou, was the king of Hamath, a city-state located in present-day Syria \([[2Sam.8.9|2 Samuel 8:9]]-10; [[1Chr.18.9|1 Chronicles 18:9]]-10\). After David defeated Hadadezer, king of Zobah, Toi sent his son Joram \(called Hadoram in 1 Chronicles\) to congratulate David and bring gifts of silver, gold, and bronze. Toi's gesture was motivated by his own conflict with Hadadezer, as Hadadezer had been at war with Toi. By sending his son to honor David, Toi sought to establish friendly relations with the rising power of Israel and secure an ally against their common enemy. The gifts brought by Joram were dedicated by David to the Lord, along with the silver and gold he had captured from various nations. This episode demonstrates David's growing reputation as a military leader and the diplomatic relationships he established with neighboring kingdoms.
