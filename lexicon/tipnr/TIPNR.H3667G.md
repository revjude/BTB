Canaan was the fourth son of Ham and the grandson of Noah \(Gen. 9:18, 22; 10:6; 1 Chr. 1:8\). He became the progenitor of the Canaanite tribes, which inhabited the land that would later be promised to Abraham and his descendants \(Gen. 10:15-19; 1 Chr. 1:13-16\). Canaan's sons included Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth, the ancestor of the Hittites. Other descendants of Canaan included the Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites, Hivites, Arkites, Sinites, Arvadites, Zemarites, and Hamathites. After Noah's drunkenness, Ham saw his father's nakedness and told his brothers \(Gen. 9:22\). In response, Noah cursed Canaan, stating that he would be a servant to his brothers \(Gen. 9:25-27\). This curse was likely a prophetic declaration about the future subjugation of the Canaanite tribes by the Israelites. The land of Canaan became synonymous with the region God promised to Abraham, and the Canaanites were among the inhabitants the Israelites were to displace and conquer \(Gen. 12:5-7; Ex. 3:8; Deut. 7:1-3\).
