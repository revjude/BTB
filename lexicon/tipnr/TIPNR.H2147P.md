Zichri was an Ephraimite warrior who lived during the reign of King Ahaz of Judah. He is mentioned in the context of a war between Israel and Judah, in which the Israelites defeated Judah and captured many prisoners. Zichri is described as a mighty warrior who killed three significant figures in Judah's royal court: Maaseiah, the king's son; Ahaziah, the governor of the palace; and Elkanah, who was second to the king. The fact that Zichri was able to kill these high-ranking officials suggests that he was a skilled and formidable warrior. His actions likely contributed to the defeat and humiliation of Judah in this conflict. The passage in 2 Chronicles 28 highlights the consequences of Ahaz's unfaithfulness to God and the resulting military defeats suffered by Judah.
