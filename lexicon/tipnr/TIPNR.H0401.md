- only referred to as Ucal **<big>[[H0401|אֻכָל]]</big>**.

Ucal is mentioned in Proverbs 30:1 as one of the recipients, along with Ithiel, of the wise sayings of Agur son of Jakeh. The name Ucal is of uncertain meaning, with some scholars suggesting it could be translated as "I am weary" or "I am consumed." Others propose that Ucal and Ithiel are not proper names but rather phrases expressing Agur's humility and the intended audience of his teachings. The sayings of Agur, found in Proverbs 30, cover various topics, including the wisdom of trusting in God, the danger of pride, and the importance of integrity. Beyond this mention, no other information is provided about Ucal in the Bible.
