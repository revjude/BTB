Shamir was a man from the hill country of Ephraim who judged Israel for 23 years \(Judg. 10:1-2\). He was the son of Puah and a member of the tribe of Issachar. After the death of Abimelech, Shamir arose to save Israel, indicating a time of crisis or oppression from which he delivered the people. He died and was buried in Shamir, his hometown in the hill country of Ephraim. Some scholars propose identifying Shamir with the town of Sanur on the road from Nablus to Jenin, but this remains uncertain as Sanur was likely outside the territory of Issachar. The Septuagint's Codex Alexandrinus reads "Samareia" instead of "Shamir," adding further complexity to the identification of the location.
