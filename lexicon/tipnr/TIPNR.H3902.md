Lahmi was the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the Philistine champion who was killed by David \([[1Chr.20.5|1Ch.20.5]]\). In another account, he is referred to as "the brother of Goliath the Gittite" \(2Sa.21.19\). Lahmi was killed by Elhanan, son of Jair the Bethlehemite, during a battle between the Israelites and the Philistines at Gob \(2Sa.21.19; [[1Chr.20.5|1Ch.20.5]]\). The exact timing of this event is unclear, but it likely occurred during the reign of David. Lahmi's death, along with the defeat of other Philistine warriors, demonstrated the Israelites' military prowess under David's leadership.
