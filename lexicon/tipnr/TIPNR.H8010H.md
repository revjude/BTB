In [[1Kgs.4.11|1 Kings 4:11]], one of Solomon's wives is mentioned as the daughter of Abinadab. She is not named but is identified by her relation to her father, who was one of Solomon's twelve district governors. Abinadab was in charge of the district of Dor, a region located in the western part of Israel, near the Mediterranean coast. As part of the administrative structure of Solomon's kingdom, each district was responsible for providing provisions for the king and his household for one month of the year \(1 Kings 4:7\). The mention of Abinadab's daughter as Solomon's wife suggests that the king may have arranged marriages with the daughters of his officials to strengthen political ties and loyalty within his kingdom. No further details about this particular wife or her relationship with Solomon are provided in the biblical text. Solomon is known to have had many wives, including foreign women, which eventually led to his downfall and the weakening of his commitment to God \(1 Kings 11:1-8\).
