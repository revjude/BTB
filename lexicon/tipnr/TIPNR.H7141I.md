Korah was a Levite who led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness \(Num.16\). He was the son of Izhar, from the Kohathite clan \([[Exod.6.21|Exo.6.21]],24\). Korah, along with Dathan, Abiram, and 250 well-known community leaders, accused Moses and Aaron of exalting themselves above the congregation \([[Num.16.1|Num.16.1]]-3\). When Korah's followers presented incense offerings, the Lord destroyed them with fire \(Num.16.35\). The earth opened and swallowed Korah, Dathan, Abiram, and their households \(Num.16.31-33\). Korah's sons, however, did not die \([[Num.26.11|Num.26.11]]\). The bronze censers of the rebels were made into a covering for the altar, as a reminder not to rebel against the Lord \(Num.16.38-40\). Korah's descendants became temple musicians \([[1Chr.6.22|1Ch.6.22]],37; Psa.42-49; 84-88\) and gatekeepers \([[1Chr.9.19|1Ch.9.19]]; 26.1,19\). Some were mighty warriors who joined David at Ziklag \([[1Chr.12.6|1Ch.12.6]]\), and others settled in Jerusalem after the exile \([[1Chr.9.31|1Ch.9.31]]\). The Korahites also sang at the reign of Jehoshaphat \([[2Chr.20.19|2Ch.20.19]]\) and were listed among the Levite clans \([[Num.26.58|Num.26.58]]\).
