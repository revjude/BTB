Galilee is a region located in northern Israel, bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the west, the Jordan River and the Sea of Galilee to the east, and the Jezreel Valley to the south. In the Old Testament, Galilee is mentioned as part of the tribal allotments of Naphtali \([[Josh.20.7|Joshua 20:7]]\) and Zebulun \([[Josh.21.32|Joshua 21:32]]\), and as a region that Solomon gave to Hiram, king of Tyre \([[1Kgs.9.11|1 Kings 9:11]]\). 

In the New Testament, Galilee plays a significant role in the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus grew up in Nazareth, a town in Galilee \([[Luke.2.39|Luke 2:39]]\), and began his public ministry in the region after being baptized by John the Baptist \([[Matt.3.13|Matthew 3:13]]; [[Mark.1.9|Mark 1:9]]\). Many of Jesus' disciples, including Peter, Andrew, James, and John, were from Galilee \(Acts 1:11\). 

Throughout the Gospels, Jesus is recorded as traveling and teaching extensively in Galilee, performing miracles and drawing large crowds \([[Matt.4.23|Matthew 4:23]]-25; [[Mark.1.28|Mark 1:28]], 39; [[Luke.4.14|Luke 4:14]], 44\). Notable events in Galilee include the wedding at Cana \([[John.2.1|John 2:1]]-11\), the healing of the centurion's servant \(Luke 7:1-10\), and the feeding of the five thousand \(Luke 9:10-17\). 

Galilee was also the location of Jesus' post-resurrection appearances to his disciples \([[Matt.28.7|Matthew 28:7]], 10, 16; John 21:1-14\). After Jesus' ascension, the early church spread throughout Galilee, Judea, and Samaria \(Acts 9:31\). 

In addition to its religious significance, Galilee was known for its agricultural fertility and was an important center of trade and commerce. The region was inhabited by a mix of Jews and Gentiles, and was known for its distinct accent and dialect \([[Matt.26.69|Matthew 26:69]]; [[Mark.14.70|Mark 14:70]]; [[Luke.22.59|Luke 22:59]]\). 

The Bible also mentions several political and social events connected to Galilee, such as the census during the time of Jesus' birth \(Luke 2:1-4\), the rule of Herod Antipas as tetrarch of Galilee \([[Luke.3.1|Luke 3:1]]\), and the Galileans whose blood Pilate mixed with their sacrifices \([[Luke.13.1|Luke 13:1]]-2\).
