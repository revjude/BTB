Eltekon is mentioned in [[Josh.15.59|Joshua 15:59]] as one of the cities in the hill country of Judah. It is listed along with other cities such as Halhul, Beth-zur, and Gedor, which were located in the southern part of the hill country. 

The name Eltekon may be derived from the Hebrew words "El" \(God\) and "tekon" \(to be straight or just\), possibly meaning "God is righteous" or "God sets right." 

No other details about Eltekon are provided in the Bible. It is mentioned only once, in the context of the cities allotted to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land under Joshua. Its exact location is unknown, but based on the cities mentioned alongside it, Eltekon was likely situated in the southern hill country of Judah, south of Jerusalem.
