Mount Hor is mentioned in [[Num.34.7|Numbers 34:7]]-8 when describing the boundaries of the land allocated to Israel. It marked the northern extent of their territory. This Mount Hor is distinct from the one where Aaron died, which was located in the south near Edom. Based on the description, it was likely in the region of Lebanon, perhaps in the vicinity of Mount Hermon. However, its precise location is uncertain.
