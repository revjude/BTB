Husband of Mary The husband of Mary, the mother of John Mark, is mentioned indirectly in Acts 12:12. His name is not provided in the biblical text. Mary was a prominent member of the early Christian community in Jerusalem, and her house served as a gathering place for prayer and fellowship. When Peter was miraculously released from prison, he went to Mary's house, where many believers were praying for him. The fact that the house is described as belonging to Mary suggests that her husband may have been deceased at the time.
