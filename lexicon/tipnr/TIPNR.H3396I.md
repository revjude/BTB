Jerahmeel, the son of Hammelech \(which means "the king"\), was an officer in the court of King Jehoiakim of Judah. When Jeremiah's scribe, Baruch, read the prophet's words in the temple, the officials reported the incident to the king. Jehoiakim ordered Jerahmeel, along with two other officers, to arrest Baruch and Jeremiah. However, the Lord hid them from the king's men. This event demonstrates the tension between the prophetic message and the royal authority, as well as God's protection of His faithful servants.
