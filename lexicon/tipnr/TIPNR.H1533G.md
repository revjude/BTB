Mount Gilboa is a mountain range located in northern Israel, southwest of the Sea of Galilee. It is most notably associated with the final battle and death of King Saul and his sons. The Philistines had gathered their forces at Shunem, while Saul and the Israelite army camped on Mount Gilboa \([[1Sam.28.4|1 Samuel 28:4]]\). In the ensuing battle, the Philistines fought fiercely against Israel, and Saul and his sons, including Jonathan, were killed on Mount Gilboa \(1 Samuel 31:1-6\). After the battle, the Philistines found the bodies of Saul and his sons and fastened them to the wall of Beth-shan \(1 Samuel 31:10\). Later, valiant men from Jabesh-gilead retrieved the bodies and buried them \(1 Samuel 31:11-13; [[2Sam.21.12|2 Samuel 21:12]]\). In his lament for Saul and Jonathan, David cursed the mountains of Gilboa, expressing his grief over their deaths \([[2Sam.1.21|2 Samuel 1:21]]\). The events at Mount Gilboa marked the end of Saul's reign and paved the way for David to become king over Israel. The mountain range stands as a reminder of the tragic fate of Saul and his sons and the transfer of power to the Davidic dynasty.
