Joel is mentioned in [[1Chr.15.7|1 Chronicles 15:7]] and 15:11 as a Levite of the Gershomite clan during the reign of King David. When David decided to bring the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem, he gathered the Levites and instructed them to consecrate themselves and carry the ark according to the proper procedures. Joel, along with his fellow Gershomites, was appointed to this sacred task. The Gershomites were one of the three main divisions of the Levites, responsible for assisting in the transportation and care of the tabernacle and its furnishings. Joel's inclusion in this narrative highlights the importance of the Levites' role in maintaining the proper worship of God and the significance of the ark's journey to Jerusalem.
