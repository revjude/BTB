Joseph is mentioned in 1 Chronicles 25 as one of the sons of Asaph, a prominent Levitical musician during the reign of King David. Asaph, along with Heman and Jeduthun, was appointed by David to lead the music and thanksgiving in the house of the Lord \(1 Chronicles 25:1\). The sons of Asaph, including Joseph, were set apart for the ministry of prophesying and providing musical accompaniment with cymbals, harps, and lyres \([[1Chr.25.2|1 Chronicles 25:2]]\). They served under the direction of their father, Asaph, who prophesied under the king's supervision \([[1Chr.25.2|1 Chronicles 25:2]]\). Joseph was also among those who were assigned duties by casting lots, ensuring a fair distribution of responsibilities \([[1Chr.25.9|1 Chronicles 25:9]]\).
