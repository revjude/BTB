Sheba, mentioned in [[1Chr.5.13|1 Chronicles 5:13]], was one of the Gadite leaders who lived in the region of Bashan. He is listed among the heads of families within the tribe of Gad during the reign of Jotham, king of Judah. The Gadites were one of the Israelite tribes that settled on the east side of the Jordan River, and Bashan was a fertile area known for its lush pastures and well-fed livestock. Sheba's mention alongside other Gadite leaders suggests that he held a position of authority and responsibility within the tribe. The text does not provide any specific details about Sheba's actions or achievements as a leader. However, his inclusion in the list of Gadite leaders highlights the importance of tribal organization and the role of family heads in the administration and governance of the tribes during this period.
