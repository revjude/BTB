Helkath, also known as Hukok, was a city located within the territory allocated to the tribe of Asher \(Josh 19:25\). It was later designated as one of the cities given to the Levites, specifically to the descendants of Gershon \(Josh 21:31; 1 Chr 6:75\). The Levites were not given a specific territory but were distributed among the other tribes to serve as priests and teachers. The allocation of cities like Helkath ensured that the Levites had places to live and carry out their duties. The exact location of Helkath is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the western part of Galilee, within the region assigned to Asher.
