Ophrah was the son of Meonothai, a descendant of Judah through the line of Caleb \([[1Chr.4.14|1 Chronicles 4:14]]\). He is mentioned in the genealogy of Judah, which lists the descendants of Judah's sons and grandsons. The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 4 provides insight into the family lines and clans within the tribe of Judah. Ophrah's mention in this genealogy suggests that he was a significant figure within his family or clan. However, no further details about Ophrah's life or role are provided in the Bible. It is worth noting that there are other individuals and places in the Bible that share the name Ophrah, but they are not related to this particular Ophrah, the son of Meonothai.
