Azariah, the descendant of Zadok, is mentioned in 1 Chronicles 6:10-11 and Ezra 7:3 as the high priest who served during the reign of King Solomon. He was a descendant of Aaron, the first high priest of Israel, through the line of Eleazar. Azariah's father, Zadok, had been a prominent priest during the reigns of David and Solomon, known for his loyalty and faithfulness. As the high priest, Azariah would have held the most important religious position in the kingdom, being responsible for overseeing the temple worship, offering sacrifices, and mediating between the people and God. The fact that he served during Solomon's reign, a time of great prosperity and peace for Israel, highlights the significance of his role in maintaining the spiritual well-being of the nation.
