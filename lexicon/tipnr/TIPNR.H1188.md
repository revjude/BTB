Baal-perazim is mentioned in 2 Samuel 5:20 and 1 Chronicles 14:11 as the location where King David decisively defeated the Philistines after becoming king over all Israel. The Philistines had come up to challenge David's rule, spreading out in the Valley of Rephaim. David inquired of the Lord and was told to attack the Philistines, which he did successfully, resulting in their defeat. David attributed the victory to God, saying, "The Lord has broken through my enemies before me, like a breakthrough of water." As a result, he named the place Baal-perazim, which means "Lord of Breakthroughs." The exact location of Baal-perazim is not specified, but it was likely situated in the Valley of Rephaim, southwest of Jerusalem.
