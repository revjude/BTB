- A king in Mesopotamia living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.14.1|Gen.14.1]]; 
- only referred to as Arioch<[[H0746A]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יו</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ך</span>ְ\).

Arioch is mentioned in Genesis 14 as the king of Ellasar, one of the four kings who allied with Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, in a battle against five kings in the region of Sodom and Gomorrah. The other kings allied with Chedorlaomer were Amraphel king of Shinar and Tidal king of Goiim. 

The biblical account states that these four kings had previously subjugated the five kings of the plain \(Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela\) for twelve years. In the thirteenth year, the five kings rebelled against Chedorlaomer's rule. As a result, Chedorlaomer and his allies, including Arioch, went to war against the rebellious kings. 

Arioch's kingdom, Ellasar, is not definitively identified but is believed to be located in the region of Mesopotamia. His participation in this battle alongside Chedorlaomer suggests that he was a powerful ruler and had a significant military force at his disposal. 

The four kings, led by Chedorlaomer, defeated the five kings and captured Lot, Abraham's nephew, along with his possessions. Upon hearing of Lot's capture, Abraham mobilized his trained men and pursued the victorious kings. Abraham successfully defeated Chedorlaomer and his allies, including Arioch, and rescued Lot and his belongings. 

Apart from this event, no further information is provided about Arioch or his kingdom in the biblical text. His mention serves to provide historical context for the political and military dynamics of the ancient Near East during the time of Abraham.
