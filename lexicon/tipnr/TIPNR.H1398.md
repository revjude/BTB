Geber, the son of Uri, is mentioned in [[1Kgs.4.19|1 Kings 4:19]] as one of the twelve district governors appointed by King Solomon. Solomon divided his kingdom into twelve districts, each governed by an appointed official. These governors were responsible for providing food for the royal household, each for one month of the year \(1 Kings 4:7\). Geber was assigned the district of Gilead, which included the territories of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan \([[1Kgs.4.19|1 Kings 4:19]]\). These territories were located east of the Jordan River and were known for their fertile lands and abundant livestock \(Numbers 32:1-5\). Geber's appointment as governor of this region highlights Solomon's effective administration and the prosperity of his kingdom. The system of district governors ensured a steady supply of resources for the royal court and demonstrated Solomon's wisdom in managing his realm.
