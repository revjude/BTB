Telaim is mentioned in [[1Sam.15.4|1 Samuel 15:4]] as the place where King Saul gathered his army before launching an attack against the Amalekites. The Amalekites were a nomadic people who had attacked the Israelites during their wilderness wanderings \(Exod. 17:8-16\). God had instructed Saul to completely destroy the Amalekites and their possessions \(1 Sam. 15:1-3\). Saul assembled an army of 200,000 men from Israel and 10,000 men from Judah at Telaim. The exact location of Telaim is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the southern part of Judah, near the region inhabited by the Amalekites. After gathering his forces at Telaim, Saul proceeded to attack and defeat the Amalekites, but he disobeyed God's command by sparing their king, Agag, and some of the best livestock. This act of disobedience led to God's rejection of Saul as king \(1 Sam. 15:10-23\).
