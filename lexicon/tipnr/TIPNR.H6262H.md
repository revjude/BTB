Attai the son of Zabad is mentioned in 1 Chronicles 12 as one of David's mighty men. He was a Gadite warrior who joined David at Ziklag when David was fleeing from King Saul. The Gadites were known for their bravery and skill in battle, and Attai was among a group of warriors described as "mighty men of valor, men trained for battle, who could handle shield and spear, whose faces were like the faces of lions." Attai's inclusion in this list of David's mighty men highlights his exceptional military prowess and his loyalty to David during a time of conflict and uncertainty.
