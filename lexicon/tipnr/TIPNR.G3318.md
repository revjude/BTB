Mesopotamia, meaning "between the rivers," refers to the ancient region located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, in modern-day Iraq, Syria, and Turkey. It is first mentioned in the Bible as the place where Abraham lived before God called him to go to Canaan \([[Gen.24.10|Genesis 24:10]]; Acts 7:2\). During the time of the judges, the Israelites were oppressed by Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, for eight years until Othniel, Caleb's younger brother, defeated him \([[Judg.3.8|Judges 3:8]], 10\). Mesopotamia was also the homeland of Balaam, the prophet hired by Balak, king of Moab, to curse Israel \(Deuteronomy 23:4\). In the New Testament, Mesopotamia is mentioned as one of the regions from which devout Jews had come to Jerusalem for the Feast of Pentecost \(Acts 2:9\). Throughout history, Mesopotamia was home to many powerful civilizations, including the Sumerians, Assyrians, and Babylonians, who played significant roles in biblical history.
