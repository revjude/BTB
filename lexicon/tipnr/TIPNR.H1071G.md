Becher is mentioned in [[Gen.46.21|Genesis 46:21]] and [[1Chr.7.6|1 Chronicles 7:6]],8 as one of the sons of Benjamin, the youngest son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\). In the Genesis passage, Becher is listed among the descendants of Jacob who went to Egypt during the time of Joseph. This list of Jacob's family members highlights the growth of the Israelite clan and their migration to Egypt due to the famine in Canaan. In 1 Chronicles 7, Becher is mentioned in the genealogy of the tribe of Benjamin. He is described as one of the three sons of Benjamin, along with Bela and Jediael. The passage also lists some of Becher's descendants, including Zemira, Joash, Eliezer, Elioenai, Omri, Jeremoth, and Abijah, who are described as mighty warriors and heads of their fathers' houses. The inclusion of Becher in these genealogies emphasizes his role as a progenitor of the Benjamite clan and the importance of family lineage in Israelite society.
