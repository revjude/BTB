- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.24.17|1Ch.24.17]]; 
- only referred to as Gamul **<big>[[H1577|גָּמוּל]]</big>**.

Gamul is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.24.17|1 Chronicles 24:17]] as the head of the twenty-second division of priests during the reign of King David. David, along with Zadok and Ahimelech, organized the priests into twenty-four divisions to ensure a systematic and orderly service in the tabernacle \(and later the temple\). Each division was responsible for serving for a specific period, and the order was determined by casting lots \(1 Chronicles 24:1-19\). Gamul's division would have been responsible for a week of service twice a year, as well as during the major festivals. The organization of the priestly divisions was an important step in establishing a structured and efficient system for worship and sacrifice in ancient Israel. Although no further details are provided about Gamul himself, his inclusion in this list highlights the significance of the priestly role in maintaining the spiritual life of the nation.
