Misrephoth-maim is mentioned in [[Josh.11.8|Joshua 11:8]] as a place near the city of Sidon where the Canaanite forces fled after being defeated by Joshua and the Israelites. In the context of the conquest of Canaan, Joshua pursued the Canaanite kings and their armies as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim, striking them down until no survivors were left. The exact location of Misrephoth-maim is uncertain, but its proximity to Sidon suggests that it was situated along the Mediterranean coast in the region of modern-day Lebanon.
