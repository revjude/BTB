Jehdeiah the Meronothite is mentioned in [[1Chr.27.30|1 Chronicles 27:30]] as the officer in charge of King David's donkeys. This chapter lists the various officials and administrators who were responsible for overseeing different aspects of David's kingdom. Jehdeiah's specific role was to manage the king's donkeys, which were likely used for transportation and agricultural purposes. The fact that he was from Meronoth, a town believed to be located in Judah, suggests that he may have had expertise in animal husbandry. The text does not provide any further information about Jehdeiah's background or his other duties in the royal administration.
