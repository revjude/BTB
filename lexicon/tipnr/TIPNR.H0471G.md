Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, served as the palace administrator under King Hezekiah of Judah. He is mentioned in 2 Kings 18-19, Isaiah 22, and Isaiah 36-37. During the Assyrian invasion, Eliakim, along with Shebna the secretary and Joah the recorder, was sent by Hezekiah to meet with the Assyrian officials \([[2Kgs.18.18|2 Kings 18:18]]\). The Assyrian commander, the Rabshakeh, delivered a threatening message, urging the people of Judah to surrender \([[2Kgs.18.26|2 Kings 18:26]]-37\). Eliakim and the others reported the message to Hezekiah, who sought the counsel of the prophet Isaiah \([[2Kgs.19.2|2 Kings 19:2]]; [[Isa.37.2|Isaiah 37:2]]\). Isaiah prophesied that God would deliver Jerusalem from the Assyrians \([[Isa.22.20|Isaiah 22:20]]-25\). Eliakim's role as palace administrator suggests that he was a high-ranking official and trusted advisor to the king. His involvement in the diplomatic negotiations with the Assyrians highlights the critical situation Judah faced during this time.
