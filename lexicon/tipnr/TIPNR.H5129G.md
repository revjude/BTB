Noadiah was a Levite who lived during the time of Ezra, after the return from the Babylonian exile. He was one of the Levites entrusted with the oversight of the treasuries of the house of God \([[Ezra.8.33|Ezra 8:33]]\). These treasuries contained the items that had been brought back from Babylon for use in the rebuilt temple in Jerusalem. Noadiah, along with other leaders, was responsible for ensuring the safe storage and proper use of these treasures.
