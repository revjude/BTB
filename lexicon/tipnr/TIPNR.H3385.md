The Wilderness of Jeruel is mentioned in [[2Chr.20.16|2 Chronicles 20:16]] as the location where King Jehoshaphat of Judah and his people were instructed to go to witness the Lord's victory over their enemies. The Moabites, Ammonites, and some of the Meunites had come to attack Judah, but God caused them to turn against each other, resulting in their defeat without Judah having to fight. The exact location of the Wilderness of Jeruel is uncertain, but it is believed to be near Tekoa, southeast of Jerusalem, in the Judean Wilderness.
