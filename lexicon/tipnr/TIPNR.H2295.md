Woman living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Hoglah</span> was one of the five daughters of Zelophehad who received an inheritance in the Promised Land due to their father's lack of male heirs.
- A woman from the tribe of Manasseh living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Num.26.33|Num.26.33]]; 
- only referred to as Hoglah<[[H2295]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ח</span>ׇ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ג</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>\); 
-  daughter of Zelophehad<[[H6765]]>; 
- a sister of Mahlah<[[H4244G]]>, Noah<[[H5270]]>, Milcah<[[H4435H]]> and Tirzah<[[H8656G]]>.

Hoglah was one of the five daughters of Zelophehad, a descendant of Manasseh, as recorded in [[Num.26.33|Numbers 26:33]], 27:1, 36:11, and [[Josh.17.3|Joshua 17:3]]. Her sisters were Mahlah, Noah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 

Zelophehad had no sons, and according to the traditional inheritance laws, his daughters would not receive a portion of the Promised Land. However, the daughters of Zelophehad approached Moses and the leaders of Israel, requesting the right to inherit their father's portion \([[Num.27.1|Numbers 27:1]]-4\). 

In response to their request, God instructed Moses to grant the daughters of Zelophehad an inheritance among their father's relatives, setting a precedent for cases where a man died without male heirs \(Numbers 27:5-11\). This ruling ensured that Hoglah and her sisters would receive a portion of the land allocated to the tribe of Manasseh. 

The story of Hoglah and her sisters is significant, as it demonstrates the importance of women's rights and their ability to advocate for themselves in a patriarchal society. Their actions led to a change in inheritance laws, ensuring that women could inherit property in the absence of male heirs.
