Seba is mentioned in the Bible as a distant kingdom, often in the context of bringing gifts and offering homage to God or His anointed king. In Psalm 72:10, the kings of Sheba and Seba are described as presenting gifts to the Messianic king. In [[Isa.43.3|Isaiah 43:3]], God promises to give Egypt, Cush, and Seba as a ransom for Israel, indicating their value and the lengths to which God will go to redeem His people. 

The exact location of Seba is uncertain, but it is generally associated with the region of Cush \(modern-day Sudan\) or the Arabian Peninsula. Some scholars suggest that Seba may have been a part of the kingdom of Sheba \(modern-day Yemen\), known for its wealth and trade in spices, gold, and precious stones. 

The biblical references to Seba highlight the universal acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and the submission of nations to His anointed king. The inclusion of Seba in prophetic and poetic texts also underscores the far-reaching impact of God's redemptive plan and the ultimate gathering of all nations to worship Him.
