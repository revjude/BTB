Nibshan was a town located in the wilderness region of Judah \(Josh. 15:62\). It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the list of towns and villages allotted to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land under Joshua. The exact location of Nibshan is unknown, but it was likely situated in the barren, sparsely populated area east of Jerusalem, near the Dead Sea.
