Palti, son of Raphu, was the representative of the tribe of Benjamin among the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan \([[Num.13.9|Numbers 13:9]]\). The spies were chosen from each of the twelve tribes of Israel to assess the land, its inhabitants, and its resources. After forty days of exploration, the spies returned with their report. While Caleb and Joshua encouraged the people to trust in God and take possession of the land, the other ten spies, including Palti, brought back a discouraging report, emphasizing the strength of the inhabitants and the challenges they faced \(Numbers 13:31-33\). As a result, the people rebelled against Moses and refused to enter the land, leading to a forty-year period of wandering in the wilderness. Palti's role as one of the spies highlights the importance of faith and obedience in the face of challenges and the consequences of unbelief and disobedience.
