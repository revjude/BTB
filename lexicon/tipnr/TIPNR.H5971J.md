Amaw is mentioned in [[Num.22.5|Numbers 22:5]] as the place where Balaam son of Beor lived. Balaam was a prophet or diviner who was summoned by Balak, king of Moab, to curse the Israelites as they approached the Promised Land. The verse describes Amaw as being near the river, likely referring to the Euphrates River, in the land of the Amawites. 

The exact location of Amaw is uncertain, but it was probably situated in the region of Aram-naharaim \(Aram of the two rivers\), which is associated with the area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Mesopotamia. This places Amaw in a region known for its ancient civilizations and cultural influences. 

Apart from its association with Balaam, no other information about Amaw is provided in the Bible. Its mention in the context of Balaam's story highlights the international scope of his reputation as a diviner and the far-reaching concern surrounding the Israelites' advance toward Canaan.
