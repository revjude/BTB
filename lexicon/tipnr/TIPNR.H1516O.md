The Valley of the Travelers, also known as the Valley of the Passengers, is mentioned in Ezekiel 39:11 in the context of the prophesied defeat of Gog and his army. According to the prophecy, after God defeats Gog and his forces, the Israelites will bury them in the Valley of the Travelers, east of the Dead Sea. The burial of Gog's army will be so extensive that it will block the path of travelers passing through the valley, hence its name. The exact location of this valley is not specified, but it is described as being east of the sea, likely referring to the Dead Sea. The burial of Gog's army in the Valley of the Travelers serves as a symbol of God's judgment against those who oppose Him and His people, and it will take seven months for the Israelites to cleanse the land by burying the dead \(Ezek. 39:12-16\).
