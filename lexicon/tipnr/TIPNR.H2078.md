Man living before Israel's Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Zebah</span> was a Midianite king who, along with Zalmunna, was defeated and killed by Gideon during the time of the judges.
- A man living before Israel's Monarchy, first mentioned at [[Judg.8.5|Jdg.8.5]]; 
- only referred to as Zebah<[[H2078]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ז</span>ֶ֫<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ח</span>\).

Zebah was one of the two Midianite kings who led a vast army that invaded and oppressed Israel during the time of the judges. For seven years, the Midianites, along with the Amalekites and other eastern peoples, would come up against Israel, destroying crops and livestock, forcing many Israelites to seek shelter in caves. God raised up Gideon to deliver Israel from the Midianites. After a decisive victory, Zebah and Zalmunna fled with a remnant of their army, but Gideon pursued them across the Jordan River and overtook them at Karkor. The kings were captured and brought back to Israel, where they confessed to killing Gideon's brothers. As a result, Gideon executed them. The name Zebah is related to the Hebrew word for "sacrifice," while Zalmunna may contain a reference to a heathen deity. Their defeat is remembered as a demonstration of God's judgment and glory.
