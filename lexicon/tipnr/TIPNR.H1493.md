People from Gizon\(?\)

The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Gizonites</span> are mentioned in [[1Chr.11.34|1 Chronicles 11:34]] without any additional context.
- People from Gizon\(?\), only mentioned at [[1Chr.11.34|1Ch.11.34]]; 
- only referred to as Gizonites **<big>[[H1493|גִּזוֹנִי]]</big>**.

The Gizonites are mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[1Chr.11.34|1 Chronicles 11:34]], as part of a list of David's mighty warriors. Hashem the Gizonite is named among these warriors, but no further information is provided about him or the Gizonite people. The context suggests that the Gizonites may have been a clan or a people group living in or near Israel during the time of David's reign, but their exact identity and location remain unknown due to the lack of additional biblical or historical references.
