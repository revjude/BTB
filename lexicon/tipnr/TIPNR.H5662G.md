- only referred to as Obadiah<[[H5662G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ָ֫<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>הו</span>ּ\).

Obadiah was a palace administrator during the reign of King Ahab of Israel \(1 Kings 18:3\). He was described as a devout believer in the Lord \(1 Kings 18:3\). When Jezebel, Ahab's wife, was killing off the prophets of the Lord, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them in two caves, supplying them with food and water \([[1Kgs.18.4|1 Kings 18:4]]\). During a severe famine, Ahab sent Obadiah to search for grass to keep the horses and mules alive \([[1Kgs.18.5|1 Kings 18:5]]-6\). While on this mission, Obadiah encountered the prophet Elijah and helped arrange a meeting between Elijah and Ahab \([[1Kgs.18.7|1 Kings 18:7]]-16\). Obadiah's actions demonstrate his courage and commitment to God, even while serving in a high position under a king who had turned away from the Lord.
