Hagar was an Egyptian maidservant of Sarah, Abraham's wife. When Sarah was unable to conceive, she gave Hagar to Abraham as a concubine to bear a child on her behalf, following the custom of the time \([[Gen.16.1|Genesis 16:1]]-3\). Hagar conceived and gave birth to a son named Ishmael \([[Gen.16.1|Genesis 16:1]]5\). However, tensions arose between Hagar and Sarah, leading Sarah to mistreat Hagar, who then fled into the wilderness \([[Gen.16.4|Genesis 16:4]]-6\). An angel of the Lord appeared to Hagar, instructing her to return and submit to Sarah, and promising that her descendants would be greatly multiplied \(Genesis 16:7-10\). Years later, after Isaac was born to Sarah, Hagar and Ishmael were sent away by Abraham at Sarah's insistence \([[Gen.21.9|Genesis 21:9]]-14\). God heard Ishmael's cry in the wilderness and provided for him and Hagar, promising to make Ishmael into a great nation \(Genesis 21:17-21\). In the New Testament, Paul uses Hagar and Sarah as an allegory, with Hagar representing the old covenant of slavery under the law, and Sarah representing the new covenant of freedom through Christ \([[Gal.4.24|Galatians 4:24]]-25\). Hagar's story illustrates God's care for the oppressed and His faithfulness to His promises, even to those outside the primary line of Abraham's descendants.
