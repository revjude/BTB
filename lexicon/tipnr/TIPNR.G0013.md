<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Agabus</span>, a prophet, foretold a famine and Paul's arrest in Jerusalem. \([[2Sam.21.8|Act.11.28]]; 21.10\)
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[2Sam.21.8|Act.11.28]]; 
- only referred to as Agabus<[[G0013]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ἄγαβος</span>\).

Agabus was a prophet from Jerusalem mentioned twice in the book of Acts. In the first instance, he came to Antioch and predicted through the Spirit that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world, which happened during the reign of Claudius. The disciples then decided to send relief to the brothers living in Judea. \([[2Sam.21.8|Act.11.28]]\) 

Later, when Paul was visiting Philip the evangelist in Caesarea, Agabus came down from Judea. He took Paul's belt, tied his own hands and feet with it, and said, "The Holy Spirit says, 'In this way the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt and will hand him over to the Gentiles.'" This prophetic act foretold Paul's arrest in Jerusalem. \(Act.21.10,11\).
