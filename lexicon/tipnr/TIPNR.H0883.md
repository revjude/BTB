Beer-lahai-roi, meaning "well of the Living One who sees me," was a well located between Kadesh and Bered in the Negev region. It is mentioned three times in the book of Genesis, all in connection with Hagar, Sarah's Egyptian maidservant. 

In Genesis 16, Hagar fled from Sarah after being mistreated. As she was wandering in the wilderness, the Angel of the Lord appeared to her near a spring of water. The Angel spoke to Hagar, encouraging her and instructing her to return to Sarah and submit to her. Hagar responded by calling the name of the Lord "You are the God who sees," and she named the well Beer-lahai-roi \([[Gen.16.14|Genesis 16:14]]\). 

Later, in [[Gen.24.62|Genesis 24:62]], it is mentioned that Isaac, Abraham's son, was living in the Negev and had come from Beer-lahai-roi when Rebekah arrived to become his wife. After Abraham's death, Isaac settled near Beer-lahai-roi \([[Gen.25.11|Genesis 25:11]]\). 

The well of Beer-lahai-roi served as a significant location in the story of Hagar and her encounters with God. It represented a place of divine revelation, provision, and comfort for Hagar during her time of distress. The name of the well itself testifies to Hagar's recognition of God's presence and His care for her in the wilderness.
