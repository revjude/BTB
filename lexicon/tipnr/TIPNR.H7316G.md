Dumah was a city located in the hill country of Judah, mentioned in the list of cities allotted to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land \([[Josh.15.52|Joshua 15:52]]\). It was situated in the southern part of Judah's territory, near the cities of Eshean and Janum. The exact location of Dumah is unknown, but it was likely located in the rugged terrain of the Judean hills. As one of the cities in the hill country, Dumah would have been part of the network of settlements that the tribe of Judah established in their allocated territory. The name "Dumah" means "silence" or "stillness" in Hebrew, but the significance of this name in relation to the city is unclear.
