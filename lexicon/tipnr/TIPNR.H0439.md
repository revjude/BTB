Allon-bacuth, meaning "oak of weeping," is mentioned in [[Gen.35.8|Genesis 35:8]] as the burial place of Deborah, Rebekah's nurse. The name suggests that the site was associated with a notable oak tree and that mourning took place there. Deborah had accompanied Rebekah when she left her home to marry Isaac \(Genesis 24:59\) and had apparently remained with the family. The mention of her burial at Allon-bacuth indicates her importance to the household and the sorrow felt at her passing. The location of Allon-bacuth is described as being below Bethel, which is situated in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Jerusalem. The specific event of Deborah's burial and the naming of the site as Allon-bacuth highlight the significance of the event in the life of Jacob's family and the enduring memory associated with the place.
