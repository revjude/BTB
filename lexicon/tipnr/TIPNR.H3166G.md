<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Jahaziel</span>, a Benjamite warrior, was one of the mighty men who joined David at Ziklag while he was hiding from Saul \([[1Chr.12.4|1Ch.12.4]]\).
- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.12.4|1Ch.12.4]]; 
- only referred to as Jahaziel **<big>[[H3166|יַחֲזִיאֵל]]</big>**.

Jahaziel is mentioned in [[1Chr.12.4|1 Chronicles 12:4]] as one of the Benjamite warriors who joined David at Ziklag while he was hiding from King Saul. This chapter lists the various groups of warriors who aligned themselves with David during this time, including men from Benjamin, Gad, and Judah. 

Jahaziel is described as a mighty man and is listed along with other Benjamite warriors who were known for their skill in battle, particularly their ability to shoot arrows and sling stones with both the right and left hands \(1Ch.12.2\). 

The fact that Jahaziel and the other warriors joined David at Ziklag is significant, as it demonstrates their loyalty to David and their belief in his rightful claim to the throne, even while Saul was still king. Ziklag was a town that had been given to David by Achish, the Philistine king of Gath, while David was seeking refuge from Saul \(1Sa.27.6\). 

No other specific details are provided about Jahaziel's life, family, or exploits. His inclusion in this list, however, highlights the support that David enjoyed from various tribes and the military strength that he was able to gather during his time of exile. These warriors would later form the core of David's army when he became king over all Israel.
