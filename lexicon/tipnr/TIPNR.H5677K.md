- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.12.20|Neh.12.20]]; 
- only referred to as Eber **<big>[[H5677|עֵבֵר]]</big>**.

Eber is mentioned in [[Neh.12.20|Nehemiah 12:20]] as one of the priests who served during the time of Joiakim, the son of Jeshua. Joiakim was the high priest who led the religious community in Jerusalem after the return from the Babylonian exile. 

The context of this mention is the listing of the heads of the priestly families during the time of Joiakim. Eber is listed along with other priests such as Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah, each representing their respective ancestral houses. 

The priests played a crucial role in the religious life of the Israelites, particularly after the return from exile. They were responsible for conducting the temple services, offering sacrifices, and teaching the people the Law of Moses. The mention of Eber as one of the priests during this time highlights the importance of the priestly lineage and their role in maintaining religious continuity. 

The listing of the priests in Nehemiah 12 is part of a larger narrative that describes the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem and the organization of the religious community after the completion of the city's reconstruction.
