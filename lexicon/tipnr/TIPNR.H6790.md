Zin refers to a desert and wilderness region located south of Judah, east of the Arabah, and west of Edom. During the Israelites' wilderness wanderings, they encamped in the Wilderness of Zin on the border of Edom \([[Num.20.1|Num.20.1]]; 33:36\). It was from here that Moses sent spies to explore the land of Canaan \([[Num.13.21|Num.13.21]]\). Later, Moses and Aaron rebelled against God's command to speak to the rock to bring forth water, instead striking it twice \(Num.27:14\). As a result, they were not allowed to enter the Promised Land. The Wilderness of Zin formed part of the southern border of the land allotted to Judah \([[Josh.15.1|Jos.15.1]],3\). It marked the extreme southern limit of the Promised Land \([[Num.34.3|Num.34.3]]-4\). The Wilderness of Zin is also associated with Kadesh \([[Num.33.36|Num.33.36]]\), a significant site during Israel's wilderness journey. The name "Zin" may be related to a Hebrew term meaning "flat" or "low," possibly referring to its lower elevation compared to the surrounding regions.
