Zaccur is listed among the priests who sealed the covenant during the time of Nehemiah. After the completion of the wall and the reading of the Law, the people of Israel made a covenant to follow God's commandments and to maintain the temple worship. The leaders, including priests, Levites, and heads of families, sealed this covenant. Zaccur's presence among the priests who sealed the covenant indicates his role in the spiritual leadership of the post-exilic Jewish community and his commitment to upholding the Law and the proper worship of God.
