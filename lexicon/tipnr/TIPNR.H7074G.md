People from Keniz\(?\)

The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Kenizzites</span> were one of the Canaanite tribes inhabiting the land God promised to give to Abraham's descendants.
- People from Keniz\(?\), only mentioned at [[Gen.15.19|Gen.15.19]]; 
- only referred to as Kenizzites **<big>[[H7074|קְנִזִּי]]</big>**.

The Kenizzites are mentioned in [[Gen.15.19|Genesis 15:19]] as one of the tribes inhabiting the land that God promised to give to Abraham's descendants. They are listed among other Canaanite tribes, such as the Kenites, Kadmonites, Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites. 

The Kenizzites were a Canaanite tribe living in the region that would later become the Promised Land for the Israelites. The mention of the Kenizzites in the context of God's covenant with Abraham highlights the challenges the Israelites would face in taking possession of the land, as it was already inhabited by various Canaanite tribes. 

Apart from this single mention in the list of Canaanite tribes, no further information is provided about the Kenizzites' specific location, culture, or history in the Bible. However, their presence in the land of Canaan is significant in understanding the context of God's promise to Abraham and the future conquest of the land by the Israelites.
