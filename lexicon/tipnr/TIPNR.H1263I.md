Baruch is briefly mentioned in [[Neh.11.5|Nehemiah 11:5]] as one of the descendants of Perez, a son of Judah, who settled in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. The context of the passage is a list of people from various tribes and families who resettled in Jerusalem and the surrounding towns. Baruch is described as "the son of Col-hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of Shiloni." This genealogy traces his lineage back to Perez, establishing him as a member of the tribe of Judah. The resettlement of Jerusalem was an important step in the restoration of Jewish life and worship after the exile. Baruch's presence in the city suggests that he was part of this process and contributed to the reestablishment of the community.
