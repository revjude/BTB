Bukki was a high priest who served in the lineage of Aaron, the first high priest of Israel \(1 Chr. 6:5, 51; Ezr. 7:4\). He was the son of Abishua and the father of Uzzi. Bukki is mentioned in the genealogies of the Levites, specifically in the line of Eleazar, Aaron's third son. These genealogies emphasize the importance of the priestly lineage and the continuity of the high priestly office throughout Israel's history. As a high priest, Bukki would have been responsible for overseeing the spiritual life of the nation, offering sacrifices, and mediating between the people and God. His inclusion in the genealogies of both 1 Chronicles and Ezra highlights the significance of his role and the preservation of the priestly line.
