<small>*Male • A Temanite, one of Job's three friends.*</small>

Man living at the time of the Patriarchs

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Eliphaz</span> the Temanite was one of Job's three friends who came to comfort him during his affliction \([[Job.2.11|Job.2.11]]\).
- A man living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Job.2.11|Job.2.11]]; 
- only referred to as Eliphaz **<big>[[H0464|אֱלִיפַז]]</big>**.

Eliphaz the Temanite was one of the three friends who visited Job during his time of suffering \([[Job.2.11|Job.2.11]]\). He is described as coming from Teman, an area known for its wisdom \(Jer.49.7\). Eliphaz, along with Bildad and Zophar, engaged in a series of dialogues with Job, attempting to explain the reasons behind Job's afflictions \(Job.4-25\). In his speeches, Eliphaz emphasizes the justice and sovereignty of God, suggesting that Job's suffering is a result of sin and urging him to repent \([[Job.4.1|Job.4.1]]; 15.1; 22.1\). However, at the end of the book, God rebukes Eliphaz and his two friends for not speaking what is right about Him, unlike Job \([[Job.42.7|Job.42.7]]\). God instructs them to offer sacrifices and have Job pray for them to be forgiven \([[Job.42.9|Job.42.9]]\). The Bible does not provide any further information about Eliphaz's life outside of his interactions with Job.
