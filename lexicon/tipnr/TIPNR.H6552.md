Pirathon was a town located in the hill country of Ephraim, in the territory allocated to the tribe of Ephraim. It is mentioned in the Bible as the hometown of several notable Israelites. Abdon, one of the judges of Israel, was from Pirathon \(Judg. 12:13, 15\). He judged Israel for eight years and was buried in Pirathon \(Judg. 12:14-15\). Two of David's mighty men, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and Hiddai \(or Hurai\) of the brooks of Gaash, were also from Pirathon \(2 Sam. 23:30; 1 Chr. 11:31; 27:14\). Benaiah, in particular, was a highly esteemed warrior who commanded the Cherethites and Pelethites, and later supported Solomon's claim to the throne \(2 Sam. 8:18; 1 Kgs. 1:8, 38, 44\). The repeated mention of Pirathon as the hometown of these significant figures suggests that it was a place of some importance during the period of the judges and the early monarchy.
