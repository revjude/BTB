Eliashib is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.3.24|1 Chronicles 3:24]] as a descendant of King David. He is listed in the genealogy of David's descendants through his son Jeconiah \(also known as Jehoiachin\). Jeconiah was one of the last kings of Judah before the Babylonian exile. The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 3 traces the royal line from David to several generations after the exile, demonstrating the continuity of David's dynasty. Eliashib's mention in this genealogy suggests that he was born during or after the Babylonian exile.
