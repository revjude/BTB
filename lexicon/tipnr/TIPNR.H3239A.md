Janoah was a town in the northern kingdom of Israel that was captured by the Assyrians during the reign of Pekah, king of Israel \([[2Kgs.15.29|2 Kings 15:29]]\). The Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser took Janoah, along with several other cities in Gilead and Galilee, and deported the inhabitants to Assyria. This event occurred around 732 BC as part of the Assyrian conquest of Israel. The exact location of Janoah is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the northern part of Israel, possibly in the region of Naphtali.
