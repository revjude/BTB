- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.3.20|Neh.3.20]]; 
- only referred to as Baruch **<big>[[H1263|בָּרוּךְ]]</big>**; 
- a son of Zabbai **<big>[[H2079|זַבַּי]]</big>**.

Baruch, the son of Zabbai, is mentioned in [[Neh.3.20|Nehemiah 3:20]] as one of the individuals who participated in repairing the wall of Jerusalem during Nehemiah's time. He is described as having "earnestly repaired" another section of the wall, starting from the angle and extending to the door of the house of Eliashib, the high priest. This suggests that Baruch was a dedicated worker who took his responsibility seriously and went beyond his assigned portion. The rebuilding of the wall was a significant project that required the cooperation and effort of various people from different families and professions. Baruch's contribution, along with that of others, helped to restore the physical and spiritual integrity of Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile.
