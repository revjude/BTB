Jobab, the son of Zerah of Bozrah, is mentioned in [[Gen.36.33|Genesis 36:33]]-34 and [[1Chr.1.44|1 Chronicles 1:44]]-45 as one of the early kings of Edom. He ruled after the death of King Bela, son of Beor, and was succeeded by Husham of the land of the Temanites. These kings reigned in Edom before any king ruled over the Israelites, indicating that the Edomite monarchy was established earlier than that of Israel. 

The mention of Jobab and other Edomite kings in these passages provides historical context for the relationship between Edom and Israel, as well as insight into the political structure of the region during the patriarchal period. However, no additional details are given about Jobab's reign or personal life.
