Zanoah is mentioned in [[Josh.15.56|Joshua 15:56]] as one of the towns in the hill country of Judah, along with other cities such as Maon, Carmel, and Ziph. This Zanoah is distinct from the Zanoah mentioned in Joshua 15:34, which was located in the Judean lowlands \(Shephelah\). The exact location of the hill country Zanoah is not specified in the Bible, but it was situated within the tribal territory of Judah, in the central highlands of Canaan. No further information about this Zanoah is provided in the Bible, and the town is not mentioned in any other context. The inclusion of Zanoah in the list of Judah's hill country towns demonstrates the thoroughness of the biblical record in documenting the allotment of the land to the tribes of Israel, even when mentioning relatively obscure places.
