Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Simon</span> was one of the brothers of Jesus, a son of Mary and Joseph.
- A man from the tribe of Judah living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Matt.13.55|Mat.13.55]]; 
- only referred to as Simon<[[G4613H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Σίμων</span>\); 
-  son of Joseph<[[G2501G]]> and Mary<[[G3137G]]>; 
- a brother of Jesus<[[G2424G]]>, James<[[G2385I]]>, Joses<[[G2500G]]> and Jude<[[G2455I]]>.

Simon is mentioned in [[Matt.13.55|Matthew 13:55]] and [[Mark.6.3|Mark 6:3]] as one of the brothers of Jesus, along with James, Joseph \(or Joses\), and Judas \(or Jude\). He was a son of Mary and Joseph and grew up in Nazareth with Jesus and his other siblings. 

The gospels do not provide any further details about Simon's life or his relationship with Jesus during his earthly ministry. However, it is noted that Jesus' brothers did not believe in him initially \(John 7:5\). 

After Jesus' resurrection and ascension, his brothers, including Simon, are mentioned as being part of the early Christian community in Jerusalem, joining the apostles in prayer \(Acts 1:14\). This suggests that Simon, along with his brothers, came to faith in Jesus as the Messiah and became involved in the early church.
