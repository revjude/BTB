Mattaniah was a man from the family of Elam who had married a foreign woman during the time of Ezra. As part of Ezra's reforms to purify the Jewish community after their return from Babylonian exile, Mattaniah and others who had married foreign wives were required to divorce them \([[Ezra.10.27|Ezra 10:27]]\). This action was taken to ensure that the Israelites remained faithful to the Lord and did not fall into the same sins that had led to their exile.
