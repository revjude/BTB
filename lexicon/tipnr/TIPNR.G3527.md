- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Neh.7.56|Act.6.5]]; 
- only referred to as Nicanor<[[G3527]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Νικάνωρ</span>\).

Nicanor was one of the seven men chosen by the early church in Jerusalem to assist the apostles in the daily distribution of food to the widows \(Acts 6:5\). He was selected along with Stephen, Philip, Prochorus, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas. These men, who were known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom, were appointed to this task so that the apostles could devote themselves to prayer and the ministry of the word. Nicanor was a Greek name, suggesting he may have been a Hellenistic Jew.
