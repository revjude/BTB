Huri is mentioned in [[1Chr.5.14|1 Chronicles 5:14]] as part of the genealogy of the tribe of Gad. He is listed as the son of Jaroah, who was a descendant of Gad through Buz. 

The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 5 traces the lineage of the Gadites, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, who settled on the east side of the Jordan River. This chapter provides a record of the Gadites' descendants, their military exploits, and their eventual exile by the Assyrians. 

Huri's mention in this genealogy serves to establish his place within the tribe of Gad and to maintain the family records that were important to the Israelites. Genealogies in the Bible often serve to demonstrate the continuity of God's people and to highlight the importance of family lineage. 

Apart from being listed in this genealogy, no other information is provided about Huri in the Bible. His inclusion in the record helps to paint a picture of the Gadite community and their history as part of the larger story of Israel.
