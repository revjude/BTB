Heshbon was a prominent Amorite city located about 50 miles east of Jerusalem, in what is now western Jordan. It was the capital of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who had taken it from the Moabites \([[Num.21.26|Num.21.26]]-30\). During the Israelites' journey to Canaan, Moses conquered Heshbon and its surrounding territories \([[Num.21.25|Num.21.25]], 34; Deut 1:4; 2:24-30; 3:2, 6; 4:46; 29:7\). The city was initially allotted to the tribe of Reuben \([[Num.32.3|Num.32.3]], 37; Josh 13:10, 17\) but was later given to the tribe of Gad \(Josh 13:26\) and then to the Levites \(Josh 21:39; 1 Chr 6:81\). Heshbon was a significant city in the region, mentioned in various contexts throughout the Bible \(Josh 9:10; 12:2, 5; Judg 11:19, 26; [[Neh.9.22|Neh.9.22]]; Song 7:4; [[Isa.15.4|Isa.15.4]]; 16:8-9; [[Jer.48.2|Jer.48.2]], 34, 45; 49:3\). Its ruins, known as Hesban, have been excavated by archaeologists, revealing its rich history from biblical times through the Byzantine period.
