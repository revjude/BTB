Hananiah is mentioned in [[Jer.36.12|Jeremiah 36:12]] as one of the officials present when Baruch, Jeremiah's scribe, read the prophet's scroll in the chamber of Elishama, the royal secretary. This event took place during the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah. Jeremiah had dictated the words of the Lord to Baruch, who wrote them on a scroll. Baruch then read the scroll in the temple, and when the officials heard about it, they summoned him to read it in their presence. Hananiah, along with the other officials, listened to the words of the scroll, which contained warnings of judgment against Judah for their disobedience. After hearing the scroll, the officials advised Baruch and Jeremiah to hide while they reported the matter to the king. The mention of Hananiah in this context suggests that he held a position of authority in the royal court.
