- A man living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Num.22.5|Num.22.5]]; 
- referred to as Beor **<big>[[H1160|בְּעוֹר]]</big>**, or Beor **<big>[[G1007|Βοσόρ]]</big>**; 
-  father of Balaam **<big>[[H1109|בִּלְעָם]]</big>**.

Beor was the father of Balaam, a well-known prophet from Pethor in Mesopotamia \(Num. 22:5\). Balaam was hired by Balak, the king of Moab, to curse the Israelites as they approached the Promised Land \(Num. 22-24\). Despite Balak's intentions, God used Balaam to bless Israel instead of cursing them \(Num. 23-24\). 

However, Balaam later played a role in leading the Israelites into sin by promoting idolatry and sexual immorality \(Num. 31:8, 16\). As a result, Balaam was killed by the Israelites when they defeated the Midianites \(Num. 31:8; Josh. 13:22\). 

Balaam's story is referenced several times in the Bible as a warning against greed and the abuse of spiritual gifts \(Deut. 23:4-5; Josh. 24:9-10; Mic. 6:5; 2 Pet. 2:15-16\). Despite his initial obedience to God, Balaam's later actions demonstrate the dangers of compromising one's faith for personal gain.
