Asa was the third king of Judah, son of Abijah \(or 'Abijam'\) and grandson of Rehoboam. He reigned for 41 years, from the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel. Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, removing idols, male cult prostitutes, and high places from Judah. He even deposed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother because she had made an obscene image of Asherah. Asa faced an invasion by Zerah the Ethiopian but defeated him with God's help after crying out to the Lord. In his later years, Asa sought help from Ben-Hadad king of Syria against Baasha king of Israel instead of relying on God and imprisoned the seer Hanani for rebuking him. Asa developed a severe foot disease but did not seek the Lord's help. He died and was succeeded by his son Jehoshaphat.
