Ahinoam of Jezreel was one of the wives of King David. She became David's wife after he fled from King Saul and settled in the wilderness of Paran. \([[1Sam.25.43|1Sa.25.43]]\) Ahinoam accompanied David during his time in Ziklag, a city given to him by Achish, the king of Gath. \([[1Sam.27.3|1Sa.27.3]]\) 

When the Amalekites raided Ziklag and took captive the women and children, including Ahinoam, David pursued the raiders and rescued all who had been captured. \([[1Sam.30.5|1Sa.30.5]],18\). 

After Saul's death, David and his wives, including Ahinoam, moved to Hebron, where David was anointed king over Judah. \([[2Sam.2.2|2Sa.2.2]]-4\) Ahinoam gave birth to David's firstborn son, Amnon, in Hebron. \([[2Sam.3.2|2Sa.3.2]]; [[1Chr.3.1|1Ch.3.1]]\) 

As one of David's wives, Ahinoam held an important position in the royal household. However, the biblical text does not provide further details about her life or her relationship with David beyond her role as the mother of Amnon.
