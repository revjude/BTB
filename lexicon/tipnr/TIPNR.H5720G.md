Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Adin</span> was one of the Jewish exiles who returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel after the Babylonian captivity, as recorded in the lists of returnees in Ezra and Nehemiah.
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.15|Ezr.2.15]]; 
- only referred to as Adin<[[H5720G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ין</span>\).

Adin is mentioned in the lists of Jewish exiles who returned to Jerusalem from Babylon after the captivity. He is recorded in [[Ezra.2.15|Ezra 2:15]] and [[Neh.7.20|Nehemiah 7:20]] among the descendants of those who came back with Zerubbabel, the leader of the first group of returnees. 

In [[Ezra.2.15|Ezra 2:15]], it is stated that 454 descendants of Adin returned to Jerusalem. The parallel passage in [[Neh.7.20|Nehemiah 7:20]] gives the number as 655. This discrepancy may be due to different counting methods or the inclusion of additional family members in one of the lists. 

Adin is also mentioned in [[Ezra.8.6|Ezra 8:6]] as one of the men who went up with Ezra from Babylon to Jerusalem. In this passage, a different group of returnees is listed, and Adin is described as a descendant of Jonathan. It is unclear whether this Adin is the same person as the one mentioned in the earlier lists or a different individual with the same name. 

The return of Adin and his fellow exiles to Jerusalem was part of the fulfillment of the prophecies concerning the restoration of Israel after the Babylonian captivity \(Jeremiah 29:10; Isaiah 44:28\). The lists of returnees in Ezra and Nehemiah emphasize God's faithfulness in bringing His people back to their homeland and the importance of reestablishing the Jewish community in Jerusalem.
