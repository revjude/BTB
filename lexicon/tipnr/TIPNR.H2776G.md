Heres is mentioned in [[Judg.8.13|Judges 8:13]] as a location near the place where Gideon and his 300 men defeated the Midianite army. After the battle, Gideon returned from the fight by way of the "ascent of Heres." The exact location of Heres is unknown, but it was likely situated in the region of Gilead, east of the Jordan River, where the Midianites had been encamped before their defeat. The name "Heres" may refer to a specific geographical feature, such as a hill or a pass, that Gideon used on his return journey.
