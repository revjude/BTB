- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[2Kgs.9.25|2Ki.9.25]]; 
- only referred to as Bidkar **<big>[[H0920|בִּדְקַר]]</big>**.

Bidkar was an officer who served under Jehu, the future king of Israel who overthrew the dynasty of Ahab \(2 Ki. 9:25\). When Elisha the prophet anointed Jehu as king, he instructed him to carry out the LORD's judgment against the house of Ahab for their wickedness, particularly for the murder of Naboth and the persecution of the prophets \(2 Ki. 9:6-10\). Bidkar was with Jehu when they encountered Jehoram, the son of Ahab, at the plot of ground that had belonged to Naboth. Jehu reminded Bidkar of the prophecy they had heard while serving under Ahab, stating that the LORD would repay Ahab's bloodshed on that very plot of land \(2 Ki. 9:25-26\). Jehu then killed Jehoram and had his body thrown on Naboth's field, fulfilling the prophecy. Bidkar's presence as a witness to these events underscores the significance of God's judgment against the house of Ahab and the role of Jehu in carrying out divine justice.
