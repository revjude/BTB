Meribah was a location in the wilderness where the Israelites quarreled with Moses and tested the Lord \([[Exod.17.7|Exodus 17:7]]\). The name Meribah means "quarrel" or "contention." The people complained about the lack of water, and Moses, following God's instructions, struck the rock, and water came out for the people to drink \(Exodus 17:5-6\). The incident at Meribah is remembered as an example of Israel's rebellion and lack of faith \(Deuteronomy 33:8; Psalm 95:8\). It serves as a warning not to harden one's heart against God as the Israelites did at Meribah.
