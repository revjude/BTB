Shephatiah was one of the sons of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, as recorded in [[2Chr.21.2|2 Chronicles 21:2]]. He is mentioned alongside his brothers Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azaryahu, Michael, and Shephatiah. The passage states that Jehoshaphat gave his sons many gifts of silver, gold, and precious things, along with fortified cities in Judah. However, the kingdom was given to Jehoram, Jehoshaphat's firstborn son. The fact that Shephatiah and his brothers received gifts from their father suggests that they held positions of importance within the royal family, even though they did not inherit the throne.
