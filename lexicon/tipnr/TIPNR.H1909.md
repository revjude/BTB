Hadadezer was the king of Zobah, an Aramean kingdom, during the reign of King David of Israel. He is mentioned in 2 Samuel 8, 10, and 1 Chronicles 18, 19. Hadadezer went to restore his control along the Euphrates River, but David defeated him, capturing many of his chariots, horsemen, and foot soldiers \([[2Sam.8.3|2 Samuel 8:3]]-4, [[1Chr.18.3|1 Chronicles 18:3]]-4\). David also took gold shields from Hadadezer's officers and brought them to Jerusalem \([[2Sam.8.7|2 Samuel 8:7]], [[1Chr.18.7|1 Chronicles 18:7]]\). When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, David defeated them as well, and they became subject to Israel \([[2Sam.8.5|2 Samuel 8:5]]-6, [[1Chr.18.5|1 Chronicles 18:5]]-6\). Later, when David's messengers were mistreated by the Ammonites, Hadadezer sent his army to help the Ammonites fight against Israel \([[2Sam.10.16|2 Samuel 10:16]], [[1Chr.19.16|1 Chronicles 19:16]]\). However, Joab and Abishai, David's commanders, defeated the Arameans and the Ammonites. After this defeat, Hadadezer's allies made peace with Israel and became subject to them \([[2Sam.10.19|2 Samuel 10:19]], [[1Chr.19.19|1 Chronicles 19:19]]\). The biblical account portrays Hadadezer as a powerful king who posed a significant threat to Israel, but was ultimately defeated by David and his army.
