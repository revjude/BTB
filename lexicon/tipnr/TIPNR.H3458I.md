Ishmael is mentioned in two parallel genealogies of the tribe of Benjamin \([[1Chr.8.38|1Ch.8.38]], 9.44\). He is listed as one of the sons of Azel, who was a descendant of King Saul. The genealogies trace Saul's lineage, demonstrating the continuation of his family line even after his death. 

No other details are provided about Ishmael's life or role within the clan. His mention in these passages serves to establish his place in the Benjamite lineage, particularly in connection to King Saul. As a descendant of Saul, Ishmael would have been part of the royal family of Israel, although he lived several generations after Saul's reign.
