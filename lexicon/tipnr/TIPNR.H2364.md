- A man from the tribe of Judah living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.4.4|1Ch.4.4]]; 
- only referred to as Hushah **<big>[[H2364|חוּשָׁה]]</big>**;

Hushah is mentioned in [[1Chr.4.4|1 Chronicles 4:4]] as part of the genealogy of the tribe of Judah. He is listed as one of the sons of Ezer, along with Penuel, the father of Gedor, and Ezra. 

The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 4 traces the lineage of several clans within the tribe of Judah, providing a record of their descendants and the cities they inhabited. This chapter is part of a larger section in 1 Chronicles that focuses on the genealogies of the twelve tribes of Israel. 

Hushah's mention in this genealogy serves to establish his place within the tribe of Judah and to maintain the family records that were important to the Israelites. Genealogies in the Bible often serve to demonstrate the continuity of God's people and to highlight the importance of family lineage. 

Apart from being listed in this genealogy, no other information is provided about Hushah in the Bible. His inclusion in the record helps to paint a picture of the Judahite community and their history as part of the larger story of Israel.
