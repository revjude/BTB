- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[2Chr.23.1|2Ch.23.1]]; 
- only referred to as Obed **<big>[[H5744|עוֹבֵד]]</big>**; 
-  father of Azariah **<big>[[H5838|עֲזַרְיָה]]</big>**.

Obed was the father of Azariah, one of the captains who supported Joash in overthrowing Queen Athaliah of Judah \([[2Chr.23.1|2 Chronicles 23:1]]\). Athaliah had seized the throne and killed many of the royal heirs, but Joash, the rightful heir, was hidden and protected. When Joash was seven years old, the priest Jehoiada and the captains, including Azariah son of Obed, made a covenant to crown Joash as king and remove Athaliah from power. The mention of Obed as Azariah's father suggests that he was a person of some influence and that his family played a role in the political events of the time.
