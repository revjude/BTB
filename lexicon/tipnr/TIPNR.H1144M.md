The Benjamin Gate is mentioned in [[Zech.14.10|Zechariah 14:10]] as part of a prophecy concerning the future restoration and transformation of Jerusalem. In this passage, the prophet describes a time when Jerusalem will be safely inhabited and the surrounding land will be turned into a plain. 

The verse states that the city will be raised up and remain in its place, from the Benjamin Gate to the place of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's winepresses. This description suggests that the Benjamin Gate was one of the key landmarks in Jerusalem's wall, possibly located on the northern side of the city, facing the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. 

The prophecy in Zechariah 14 speaks of a future time when Jerusalem will be exalted and secure, with the Lord being king over all the earth. The mention of the Benjamin Gate in this context highlights its significance as part of the restored and transformed city. 

It is worth noting that the Benjamin Gate mentioned in Zechariah may not necessarily be the same gate as the one referenced in the book of Jeremiah, as the two prophets lived at different times in history. However, both gates were likely named after the tribe of Benjamin and were important landmarks in Jerusalem's topography.
