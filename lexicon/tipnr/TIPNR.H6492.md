Pekah son of Remaliah was the king of Israel for 20 years, according to 2 Kings 15. He came to power by conspiring against and assassinating King Pekahiah. During his reign, Pekah allied with Rezin king of Aram to attack Judah, but they were unsuccessful in capturing Jerusalem \([[2Kgs.16.5|2 Kings 16:5]]; [[Isa.7.1|Isaiah 7:1]]\). However, Pekah did inflict heavy casualties on Judah, killing 120,000 in one day \([[2Chr.28.6|2 Chronicles 28:6]]\). Pekah's reign ended when Hoshea conspired against him, killed him, and succeeded him as king. Pekah's reign was marked by political instability and conflict with Judah.
