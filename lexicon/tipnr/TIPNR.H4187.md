Mushi was a Levite who lived during the time of Moses and the Exodus. He was the son of Merari, one of the three sons of Levi, and the grandson of Levi himself \([[Exod.6.19|Exodus 6:19]]; [[Num.3.20|Numbers 3:20]]; [[1Chr.6.19|1 Chronicles 6:19]],47\). Mushi's descendants formed a clan within the Levitical tribe known as the Mushites \([[Num.3.33|Numbers 3:33]]; 26:58\). 

As a member of the Levitical tribe, Mushi and his descendants were responsible for assisting the priests in the tabernacle and later in the temple. In the wilderness, the Mushites were specifically assigned to carry the frames, crossbars, posts, and bases of the tabernacle whenever the Israelites moved camp \(Numbers 3:36-37\). 

The descendants of Mushi are mentioned in several genealogies in 1 Chronicles, which trace the lineage of the Levites. These passages highlight the importance of the Levitical clans in maintaining the religious life of ancient Israel \([[1Chr.23.21|1 Chronicles 23:21]]-23; 24:26,30\). 

Mushi's role as the head of a Levitical clan emphasizes the hereditary nature of the Levitical priesthood and the importance of family lineage in determining one's responsibilities within the religious system of ancient Israel. The Mushites, along with the other Levitical clans, played a vital role in supporting the priests and ensuring the proper functioning of the tabernacle and temple worship.
