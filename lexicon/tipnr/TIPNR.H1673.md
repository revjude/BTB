<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Doeg</span> the Edomite, Saul's chief shepherd, witnessed David receiving help from Ahimelech and later betrayed him to Saul, resulting in the massacre of the priests at Nob. \([[1Sam.21.7|1Sa.21.7]]; 22.9,18,18,22; Psa.52.1\)
- A man living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Sam.21.7|1Sa.21.7]]; 
- only referred to as Doeg **<big>[[H1673|דֹּאֵג]]</big>**.

Doeg the Edomite was a chief shepherd in the service of King Saul. He first appears in [[1Sam.21.7|1 Samuel 21:7]], where he is described as the chief herdsman of Saul and is present at the tabernacle in Nob when David arrives seeking help from the priest Ahimelech. 

Later, in 1 Samuel 22, Doeg plays a crucial role in the events that follow. When Saul learns that Ahimelech had assisted David, he summons the priests to appear before him. Doeg, being present at the time, informs Saul that he had seen David receiving help from Ahimelech \([[1Sam.22.9|1 Samuel 22:9]]-10\). 

Acting on Saul's orders, Doeg kills 85 priests who were wearing the linen ephod, as well as the entire city of Nob, including men, women, children, and livestock \(1 Samuel 22:18-19\). This massacre highlights Doeg's ruthless obedience to Saul and his willingness to carry out violent acts against innocent people. 

Doeg's actions are condemned in Psalm 52, which is attributed to David. The psalm describes Doeg as a deceitful and evil man who loves falsehood and delights in destruction \(Psalm 52:1-4\). The psalmist expresses confidence that God will bring judgment upon Doeg and that the righteous will ultimately prevail \(Psalm 52:5-9\). 

Doeg's story serves as an example of the dangers of misplaced loyalty and the consequences of aligning oneself with those who oppose God's chosen leaders. His betrayal of David and his role in the massacre at Nob stand in stark contrast to the faithfulness and righteousness exemplified by David and Ahimelech.
