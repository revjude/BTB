Abiezer the Anathothite was one of David's mighty men, a group of skilled warriors who fought alongside King David. He was from Anathoth, a town in the territory of Benjamin \([[2Sam.23.27|2 Samuel 23:27]]; [[1Chr.11.28|1 Chronicles 11:28]]\). Abiezer also served as one of the commanders of David's army, leading a division of 24,000 men during the ninth month of the year \([[1Chr.27.12|1 Chronicles 27:12]]\). His inclusion in the lists of David's mighty men and his role as a commander indicate that he was a valiant and trusted soldier in David's service.
