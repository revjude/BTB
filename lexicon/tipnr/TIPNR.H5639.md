Sethur, mentioned in [[Num.13.13|Numbers 13:13]], was the son of Michael and one of the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan. He was chosen to represent the tribe of Asher. Along with the other spies, Sethur was instructed to assess the land, its inhabitants, and its agricultural potential. After forty days, the spies returned with their report. While Caleb and Joshua encouraged the Israelites to trust in God and take possession of the land, the other ten spies, including Sethur, presented a discouraging report, emphasizing the strength of the inhabitants and the challenges they faced. This lack of faith led to the Israelites wandering in the wilderness for forty years.
