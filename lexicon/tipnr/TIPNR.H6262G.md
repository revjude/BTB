Attai is mentioned in the genealogy of Judah in 1 Chronicles 2. He was the son of Jarha, an Egyptian servant of Sheshan, and Sheshan's daughter Ahlai. Sheshan had no sons of his own, so he gave his daughter in marriage to his servant Jarha, and their descendants, including Attai, were reckoned as part of Sheshan's lineage. This unusual arrangement preserved Sheshan's family line and ensured the continuation of his inheritance within the tribe of Judah. Attai's inclusion in the genealogy highlights the importance of maintaining family heritage and the creative measures taken to preserve lineage in ancient Israel.
