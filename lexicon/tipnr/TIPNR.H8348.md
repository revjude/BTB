Sheshan was a member of the Jerahmeelite clan, which was part of the tribe of Judah. He is mentioned in the genealogical record of 1 Chronicles 2. Sheshan had no sons, only daughters \(v. 34\). Faced with the prospect of his lineage ending, Sheshan took an unconventional step. He gave one of his daughters in marriage to his Egyptian servant, Jarha \(v. 35\). This act allowed Sheshan's line to continue through his daughter and his servant. The passage goes on to list the descendants of Sheshan through this union, indicating that his decision had a lasting impact on his family line. This account highlights the importance of preserving one's lineage and the measures taken to ensure its continuation, even if it meant crossing social boundaries.
