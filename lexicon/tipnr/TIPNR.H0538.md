Amam is mentioned in [[Josh.15.26|Joshua 15:26]] as one of the towns allotted to the tribe of Judah in the Negev region, the southern part of the Promised Land. It is listed among other towns such as Shema, Moladah, and Hazar-gaddah, indicating its location in the arid wilderness area south of Hebron. No other information about Amam is provided in the Bible, and its exact location is unknown. As part of Judah's inheritance, Amam would have been settled by members of the tribe following the conquest of Canaan under Joshua's leadership.
