Zabdi the Shiphmite was one of the officials in King David's administration. He was appointed as the overseer of the wine cellars, responsible for the storage and distribution of wine in the royal household. Zabdi's role indicates the importance of wine production and consumption in ancient Israelite society, particularly in the context of the king's court. His designation as a Shiphmite suggests he may have originated from the town of Shepham, although the exact location is uncertain.
