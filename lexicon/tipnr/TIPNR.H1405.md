Gibbethon was a city allotted to the tribe of Dan \([[Josh.19.44|Joshua 19:44]]\) and designated as a Levitical city for the descendants of Kohath \([[Josh.21.23|Joshua 21:23]]\). The city gained prominence during the period of the Divided Monarchy, particularly during the reigns of Nadab and Baasha, kings of Israel. Nadab, the son of Jeroboam I, was besieging Gibbethon when he was assassinated by Baasha \(1 Kings 15:27\). Later, during the reign of Baasha's son Elah, the Israelite army was again besieging Gibbethon when Zimri, a commander of chariots, conspired against Elah and killed him \([[1Kgs.16.15|1 Kings 16:15]]\). The siege of Gibbethon by the Israelite army suggests that the city may have been under Philistine control at the time. These events highlight the strategic importance of Gibbethon and its role in the power struggles within the Northern Kingdom of Israel.
