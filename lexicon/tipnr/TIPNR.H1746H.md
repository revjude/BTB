Dumah, mentioned in [[Isa.21.11|Isaiah 21:11]], was a city or region located in Arabia, likely in the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula. The name "Dumah" means "silence" or "stillness" in Hebrew. In the prophetic oracle, a watchman from Dumah calls out to the prophet Isaiah, asking about the night and the coming of the morning. Isaiah's response is cryptic, indicating that while morning is coming, the night will also return. This oracle is part of a series of prophecies concerning various nations, and it suggests that Dumah, like other nations, would face God's judgment. The exact identity and location of Dumah in this context are uncertain, but it was likely a significant city or region in ancient Arabia.
