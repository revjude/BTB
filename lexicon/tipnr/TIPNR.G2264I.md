Herod Agrippa I was the grandson of Herod the Great and ruled as king over Judea, Samaria, and other regions from 41 to 44 AD. In the book of Acts, he is portrayed as a persecutor of the early Christian church. Herod Agrippa I had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword \([[2Tim.1.15|Act.12.1]]-2\). Seeing that this pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter as well, intending to bring him out for public trial after the Passover \(Act.12.3-4\). However, an angel miraculously freed Peter from prison \(Act.12.6-11\). When Herod Agrippa I discovered Peter's escape, he had the guards executed \([[2Tim.1.15|Act.12.1]]9\). Later, Herod Agrippa I was involved in a dispute with the people of Tyre and Sidon \(Act.12.20\). On the appointed day, he delivered a public address to them, and the people shouted, "This is the voice of a god, not of a man!" \(Act.12.21-22\). Immediately, an angel of the Lord struck him down because he did not give glory to God, and he was eaten by worms and died \(Act.12.23\). \([[2Tim.1.15|Act.12.1]]-23\).
