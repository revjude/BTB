Mallothi was one of the sons of Heman, a prominent musician in King David's court. Heman, along with Asaph and Jeduthun, was appointed by David to lead the music and thanksgiving in the tabernacle. Mallothi and his brothers were skilled musicians who prophesied with lyres, harps, and cymbals. They were assigned by lot to serve in the tabernacle, with Mallothi being the nineteenth in order \([[1Chr.25.4|1 Chronicles 25:4]], 26\).
