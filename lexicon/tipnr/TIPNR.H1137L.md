Bani is mentioned in [[Neh.3.17|Nehemiah 3:17]] as one of the Levites who participated in repairing the wall of Jerusalem. During the time of Nehemiah, the city's walls were in disrepair, leaving the inhabitants vulnerable. Nehemiah organized a massive rebuilding effort, with different individuals and groups taking responsibility for specific sections \(Nehemiah 3:1-32\). Bani worked on a portion of the wall alongside Hashabiah, the leader of half the district of Keilah. The Levites' involvement in the wall reconstruction demonstrates their commitment to the well-being and security of the community, as well as their support for Nehemiah's leadership.
