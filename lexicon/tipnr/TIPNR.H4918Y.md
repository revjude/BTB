Meshullam is mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as the head of the priestly family of Ginnethon during the high priesthood of Joiakim \([[Neh.12.16|Neh.12.16]]\). Joiakim was the son of Jeshua, the high priest who had returned from the Babylonian exile with Zerubbabel. In the list of priests and Levites who served during this time, Meshullam is named as the leader of the Ginnethon family. This suggests that Meshullam had a significant role in overseeing the priestly duties and responsibilities of his family.
