Salu is mentioned in [[Num.25.14|Numbers 25:14]] as the father of Zimri, a prince of the Simeonite tribe. The context of this passage is the Israelites' encounter with the Moabites and Midianites at Shittim, where the Israelites began to engage in sexual immorality and idolatry with the women of these nations \(Numbers 25:1-3\). This sin provoked God's anger, and He sent a plague among the Israelites \(Numbers 25:4-5\). During this time, an Israelite man named Zimri brought a Midianite woman named Cozbi into his tent in full view of the congregation, who were weeping at the entrance of the tabernacle \(Numbers 25:6\). Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron the priest, saw this and took a spear, followed the man into the tent, and killed both Zimri and Cozbi \(Numbers 25:7-8\). This act of zeal turned away God's wrath, and the plague stopped \(Numbers 25:9-11\). The passage identifies Zimri as the son of Salu, a prince of a Simeonite father's house, emphasizing his prominent position within the tribe \([[Num.25.14|Numbers 25:14]]\). Salu's mention in this context serves to underscore the severity of his son's sin and the consequences it brought upon the Israelites.
