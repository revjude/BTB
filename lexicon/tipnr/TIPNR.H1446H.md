In [[1Chr.4.39|1 Chronicles 4:39]], Gedor is mentioned as a region where some members of the tribe of Simeon went to find pasture for their flocks during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. This Gedor is likely a different location from the town of Gedor mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. 

According to the text, the Simeonites, faced with a shortage of pasture for their growing herds, traveled to the entrance of Gedor, to the east of the valley, in search of suitable grazing land. They found rich and good pasture there, and the land was spacious, quiet, and peaceful, as some of the descendants of Ham had previously settled there. 

The Simeonites, led by Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, attacked and defeated the Hamites and Meunites who inhabited the region, destroying them completely. They then settled in the area themselves, as it provided ample pasture for their flocks. 

This event took place during the reign of Hezekiah, king of Judah, which suggests that it occurred sometime between 715 and 686 BC. The Simeonites' search for new pasture lands reflects the challenges faced by pastoral communities in ancient Israel and their willingness to migrate and engage in conflict to secure resources for their livestock. 

The specific location of this Gedor is uncertain, but it is described as being to the east of a valley and having been previously inhabited by descendants of Ham, suggesting that it may have been situated in the Negev region or beyond, possibly in the direction of Edom or Sinai.
