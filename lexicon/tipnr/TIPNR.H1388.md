The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 2 traces the descendants of Judah, with a focus on the line of Hezron, which includes Caleb. Gibea's mention in this genealogy highlights the significance of family lineage and the role of women in establishing settlements and communities in ancient Israel. However, no further details are provided about Gibea's life or the specific location of the cities founded by her son, Sheva.
