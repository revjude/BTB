- A man living at the time of the Patriarchs, only mentioned at [[Gen.15.2|Gen.15.2]]; 
- only referred to as Eliezer **<big>[[H0461|אֱלִיעֶזֶר]]</big>**.

Eliezer of Damascus was a servant in Abraham's household who was mentioned as a potential heir to Abraham's estate before the birth of Ishmael and Isaac \([[Gen.15.2|Gen.15.2]]\). In a conversation with God, Abraham lamented his lack of children and named Eliezer as the steward of his house and the one who would inherit his possessions. However, God promised Abraham that he would have a son of his own, and this promise was fulfilled through the births of Ishmael and Isaac.
