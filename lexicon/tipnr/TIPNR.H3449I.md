In 1 Chronicles 24:25, Isshiah is again mentioned in the context of organizing the Levitical duties. He is described as the son of Rehabiah, emphasizing his lineage and connection to Moses. 

As a Levite, Isshiah would have been responsible for various duties related to the tabernacle and later the temple, such as assisting the priests, singing, playing musical instruments, and maintaining the sacred spaces. 

No other specific details are provided about Isshiah's life or role. His inclusion in these passages serves to highlight the importance of the Levites in the worship and service of God, as well as the continuity of their lineage from the time of Moses to the reign of David.
