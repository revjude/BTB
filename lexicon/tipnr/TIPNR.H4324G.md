Michal was the younger daughter of King Saul and became the first wife of David, Israel's future king. She first appears in the genealogy of Saul \([[1Sam.14.49|1Sa.14.49]]\) and is later mentioned as loving David \([[1Sam.18.20|1Sa.18.20]]\). Saul, seeking to ensnare David, offered Michal's hand in marriage, demanding a bride price of 100 Philistine foreskins. David fulfilled this requirement, and Michal became his wife \([[1Sam.18.27|1Sa.18.27]]-28\). When Saul attempted to kill David, Michal helped him escape through a window and deceived Saul's messengers by placing an idol in David's bed \([[1Sam.19.11|1Sa.19.11]]-17\). During David's exile, Saul gave Michal in marriage to Palti \([[1Sam.25.44|1Sa.25.44]]\). After Saul's death, David demanded that Michal be returned to him as a condition for peace with Abner \([[2Sam.3.13|2Sa.3.13]]-14\). Later, when David danced before the ark of the Lord, Michal despised him in her heart \([[2Sam.6.16|2Sa.6.16]]; [[1Chr.15.29|1Ch.15.29]]\). She confronted David, criticizing his behavior, but David rebuked her \([[2Sam.6.20|2Sa.6.20]]-21\). As a result, Michal remained childless until her death \([[2Sam.6.23|2Sa.6.23]]\). Michal's story illustrates the complex relationships and conflicts within Saul's family and the early years of David's rise to power.
