Nimshi was the grandfather of Jehu, who became king of Israel \([[2Kgs.9.2|2 Kings 9:2]]\). Jehu was often referred to as "the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi" \([[2Kgs.9.14|2 Kings 9:14]], 20; [[2Chr.22.7|2 Chronicles 22:7]]\). Nimshi's son Jehoshaphat was the father of Jehu. The prophet Elijah was instructed by God to anoint Jehu as king of Israel \([[1Kgs.19.16|1 Kings 19:16]]\), a task that was later carried out by Elisha's servant \(2 Kings 9:1-10\). Jehu went on to overthrow the dynasty of Ahab and Jezebel, fulfilling the prophecies against them.
