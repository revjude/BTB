Shammai, mentioned in 1 Chronicles 2:28,32, was a descendant of Judah through the line of Hezron. He was the son of Onam and the grandson of Jerahmeel. Shammai had two sons, Nadab and Abishur, who are listed in the genealogical record of Judah. The text does not provide any specific details about Shammai's life or his role within the family. However, his inclusion in the genealogy highlights the importance of documenting and preserving family lineages, especially within the tribe of Judah, from which the Messiah would come. The mention of Shammai and his sons serves to trace the descendants of Judah and show the continuation of the family line through multiple generations.
