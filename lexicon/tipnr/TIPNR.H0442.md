Alush was one of the places where the Israelites camped during their journey through the wilderness after the Exodus from Egypt. It is mentioned in [[Num.33.13|Numbers 33:13]]-14 as being located between Dophkah and Rephidim in the Sinai Peninsula. The Israelites arrived at Alush after departing from Dophkah and subsequently traveled to Rephidim. No specific events are recorded as having taken place at Alush, suggesting it was simply a stopover point during the journey. The exact location of Alush is unknown, as are many of the campsites mentioned in the Exodus itinerary. Its inclusion in the list of encampments helps to trace the route taken by the Israelites on their way to Mount Sinai and ultimately to the Promised Land.
