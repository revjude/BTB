Elkanah is mentioned as one of the Korahites, a Levitical clan, who joined David at Ziklag while he was fleeing from King Saul \([[1Chr.12.6|1Ch.12.6]]\). The Korahites were known for their musical abilities and served as musicians and gatekeepers in the tabernacle and later in the temple. Elkanah, along with other mighty men from various tribes, gathered to David and offered their support to him during his time of exile. The text describes these men as skilled warriors, ready for battle, and able to handle both the spear and the shield \(1Ch.12.8\). Elkanah's presence among David's supporters demonstrates the loyalty and courage of the Korahites who aligned themselves with David even before he became king.
