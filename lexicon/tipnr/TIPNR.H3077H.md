Jehoiada, also referred to as Barachiah in [[Matt.23.35|Matthew 23:35]], was a high priest during the reign of King Joash of Judah. He played a crucial role in preserving the Davidic lineage and restoring the worship of Yahweh in Judah. 

When Athaliah, the mother of the deceased king Ahaziah, seized the throne and ordered the execution of all the royal heirs, Jehoiada and his wife Jehosheba rescued the infant Joash and hid him in the temple for six years \(2 Kings 11:1-3; [[2Chr.22.11|2 Chronicles 22:11]]-12\). In the seventh year, Jehoiada gathered the military leaders and Levites, revealing the existence of the rightful heir and orchestrating a coup against Athaliah \([[2Kgs.11.4|2 Kings 11:4]]-12; [[2Chr.23.1|2 Chronicles 23:1]]-11\). Joash was crowned king, and Athaliah was executed \(2 Kings 11:13-16; [[2Chr.23.1|2 Chronicles 23:1]]2-15\). 

During Joash's reign, Jehoiada served as his advisor and guided him in the ways of the Lord \([[2Kgs.12.2|2 Kings 12:2]]\). Jehoiada also initiated repairs to the temple and oversaw the collection of funds for this purpose \([[2Kgs.12.7|2 Kings 12:7]]-16; 2 Chronicles 24:4-14\). He died at the age of 130 and was buried among the kings in the City of David, a testament to his significant role in the history of Judah \([[2Chr.24.15|2 Chronicles 24:15]]-16\). 

After Jehoiada's death, Joash turned away from the Lord and even ordered the execution of Jehoiada's son, Zechariah, for speaking out against the king's disobedience \([[2Chr.24.17|2 Chronicles 24:17]]-22; [[Matt.23.35|Matthew 23:35]]\). This act of betrayal led to the downfall of Joash and the kingdom of Judah.
