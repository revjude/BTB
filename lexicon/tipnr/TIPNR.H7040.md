Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Kallai</span> was a priest who served during the time of Joiakim, the son of Jeshua, after the Babylonian exile.
- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.12.20|Neh.12.20]]; 
- only referred to as Kallai<[[H7040]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ק</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>ַּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>\).

Kallai is mentioned in [[Neh.12.20|Nehemiah 12:20]] as one of the priests who served during the time of Joiakim, the son of Jeshua. The context of the passage is the list of priests and Levites who served in the temple after the Babylonian exile \(Nehemiah 12:1-26\). 

Kallai is listed as the head of the priestly family of Sallai \([[Neh.12.20|Nehemiah 12:20]]\). This suggests that he was a prominent priest who led his family in their service at the temple during the post-exilic period. 

The mention of Kallai in this list highlights the importance of the priestly families and their organization in the restored community of Israel. It also demonstrates the continuity of priestly service and the significance of the temple in the religious life of the people after the exile. 

Apart from this brief mention in Nehemiah, no other information is provided about Kallai's life, specific role, or the duration of his service as a priest.
