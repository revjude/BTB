Azarel is mentioned in Nehemiah 12 as one of the priests who participated in the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem. After the completion of the wall's reconstruction under Nehemiah's leadership, a great celebration was held to dedicate the wall and give thanks to God. The priests and Levites were divided into two groups, with one group walking on top of the wall in a procession of praise and thanksgiving. Azarel is listed among the priests who were part of this procession, along with other prominent figures such as Ezra the scribe. The dedication of the wall was a significant event, marking the restoration of Jerusalem's defenses and the renewal of the people's commitment to God.
