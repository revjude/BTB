Nathan is briefly mentioned in 1 Chronicles 2:36 as part of the genealogy of the tribe of Judah. He is identified as the son of Attai and the father of Zabad. 

The genealogical record in 1 Chronicles 2 traces the descendants of Judah, one of the twelve sons of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and the founder of the tribe that bears his name. This genealogy includes several prominent figures in Israelite history, such as Caleb, Boaz, and David. 

Nathan's mention in this genealogy serves to establish his place within the lineage of Judah and to demonstrate the continuity of the tribe through the generations. However, beyond his identification as the son of Attai and the father of Zabad, no further details are provided about Nathan's life, character, or role within the tribe. 

The inclusion of Nathan in this genealogical record highlights the importance of family lineage and tribal identity in ancient Israelite society. These genealogies served to establish the legitimacy of land claims, leadership roles, and the preservation of the tribe's history and connection to their ancestors.
