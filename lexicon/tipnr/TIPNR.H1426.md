- A man living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, only mentioned at [[Num.13.11|Num.13.11]];

Gaddi, the son of Susi, is mentioned in [[Num.13.11|Numbers 13:11]] as the representative of the tribe of Manasseh among the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan. The spies were tasked with scouting out the land, assessing its resources, and gathering information about its inhabitants \(Numbers 13:17-20\). Gaddi was one of the ten spies who brought back a negative report, emphasizing the strength of the Canaanites and the challenges of conquering the land \(Numbers 13:31-33\). Only Joshua and Caleb, the other two spies, gave a positive report and encouraged the Israelites to trust in God's promise \(Numbers 14:6-9\). As a result of the people's unbelief and rebellion, God declared that the generation who had witnessed the Exodus would not enter the Promised Land, except for Joshua and Caleb \(Numbers 14:20-35\).
