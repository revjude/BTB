- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Ezra.4.9|Act.17.34]]; 
- only referred to as Dionysius<[[G1354]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Διονύσιος</span>\).

Dionysius, also known as Dionysius the Areopagite, is mentioned in Acts 17:34 as one of the individuals who believed in Paul's message when he preached in Athens. The Areopagus was a council of elders and a place of philosophical discussion in ancient Athens, and Dionysius was a member of this council. 

The context of this passage is Paul's visit to Athens, where he engaged in discussions with Epicurean and Stoic philosophers \(Acts 17:16-18\). Some of these philosophers brought Paul to the Areopagus, where he delivered a speech, proclaiming the truth about the "Unknown God" and the resurrection of Jesus Christ \(Acts 17:19-31\). 

While some mocked Paul's message, particularly the idea of the resurrection, others wanted to hear more \(Acts 17:32\). Among those who believed were Dionysius and a woman named Damaris, along with some others \(Acts 17:34\). 

The mention of Dionysius by name and his designation as an Areopagite suggests that he was a prominent figure in Athenian society. His conversion to Christianity demonstrates the power of the gospel to reach individuals from various backgrounds and intellectual traditions. 

According to church tradition, Dionysius later became the first bishop of Athens. However, this information is not found in the Bible, and the historical reliability of these traditions is uncertain.
