Elam was an ancient kingdom located east of Babylonia in what is now southwestern Iran. The Elamites were descendants of Shem, son of Noah \(Genesis 10:22\). Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, was an ally of other Mesopotamian kings who fought against Sodom and Gomorrah and took Lot captive before being defeated by Abraham \([[Gen.14.1|Genesis 14:1]]-16\). 

The Elamites were skilled archers \([[Isa.22.6|Isaiah 22:6]]\) and were sometimes allies of Israel's enemies. Elamite kings are mentioned in Assyrian records of campaigns against Judah. The prophets Isaiah \(11:11, 21:2, 22:6\) and Jeremiah \(25:25, 49:34-39\) foretold Elam's conquest by the Babylonians and Medes as part of God's judgment. 

However, Jeremiah also prophesied Elam's restoration in the latter days \(49:39\). Some Elamites were present in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost \(Acts 2:9\). Nehemiah's opponents included a man named Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab \(Nehemiah 2:19, 6:1\), possibly indicating alliances between Elam and Israel's neighbors. The references to Elam in [[Dan.8.2|Daniel 8:2]] suggest the province maintained some importance during the Persian period.
