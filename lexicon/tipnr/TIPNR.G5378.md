- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Rom.16.15|Rom.16.15]]; 
- only referred to as Philologus<[[G5378]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Φιλόλογος</span>\).

Philologus is mentioned in Paul's letter to the Romans as one of the believers in Rome to whom Paul sends greetings \([[Rom.16.15|Romans 16:15]]\). He is listed alongside Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Paul describes them as "saints" or "holy ones," indicating that they were part of the Christian community in Rome. The name Philologus means "lover of the word" in Greek, which may suggest that he was known for his devotion to learning or his love for the scriptures. However, no further details about Philologus' life, background, or role in the Roman church are provided in the Bible. Paul's greeting to Philologus and the others demonstrates the close-knit nature of the early Christian community and the importance of personal relationships and mutual support among believers.
