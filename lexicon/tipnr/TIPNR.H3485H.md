Issachar is mentioned in [[1Chr.26.5|1 Chronicles 26:5]] as one of the sons of Obed-Edom, a gatekeeper in the time of King David. Obed-Edom and his sons were appointed as gatekeepers for the ark of the covenant after it was brought to Jerusalem \(1Ch.15.18,24\). 

In the context of organizing the gatekeepers, Issachar is listed among his brothers as one of Obed-Edom's eight sons, all of whom are described as "able men with strength for the service" \(1Ch.26.8\). This description suggests that Issachar and his brothers were well-suited for their role as gatekeepers, which required both physical strength and spiritual devotion. 

No other details are provided about Issachar's life or specific duties. His inclusion in this list highlights the importance of the gatekeeper role in maintaining the order and sanctity of the temple, as well as the significance of family lineage in determining these sacred responsibilities.
