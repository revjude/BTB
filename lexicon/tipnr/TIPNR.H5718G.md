Adaiah is mentioned in [[2Kgs.22.1|2 Kings 22:1]] as the father of Jedidah who was mother of King Josiah of Judah. Adaiah came from Bozkath, a town in the Shephelah region of Judah. Jedidah's husband and Josiah's father was Amon, who reigned as king of Judah for two years before being assassinated by his servants \(2 Kings 21:19-23\). 

Josiah became king at the age of eight and reigned for thirty-one years in Jerusalem \([[2Kgs.22.1|2 Kings 22:1]]\). He is known for his religious reforms and his commitment to following the laws of God. During his reign, the Book of the Law was discovered in the temple, leading to a renewal of the covenant and the celebration of the Passover \(2 Kings 22-23\). 

Although Adaiah is only briefly mentioned as Josiah's mother, her inclusion in the narrative highlights the importance of maternal lineage in the royal dynasty of Judah. It also provides a geographical connection to the town of Bozkath, indicating the diverse origins of the mothers of Judean kings.
