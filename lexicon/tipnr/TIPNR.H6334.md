Poratha was one of the ten sons of Haman, the chief villain in the Book of Esther. Haman was a high-ranking official in the Persian court who plotted to destroy the Jewish people throughout the empire. However, his plan was foiled by Queen Esther and her cousin Mordecai, leading to Haman's downfall and execution. In [[Esth.9.8|Esther 9:8]], Poratha is mentioned among the ten sons of Haman who were also hanged on the gallows that Haman had prepared for Mordecai. The execution of Haman's sons served as a powerful demonstration of the reversal of fortune and the triumph of the Jewish people over their enemies.
