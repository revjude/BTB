Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Adonijah</span> was one of the Levites who sealed the covenant led by Nehemiah to follow the Law of God.
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.10.16|Neh.10.16]]; 
- only referred to as Adonijah<[[H0138I]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>ֲ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ָּ֫<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>הו</span>ּ\).

Adonijah is listed in [[Neh.10.16|Nehemiah 10:16]] as one of the Levites who sealed the covenant made by the people of Israel during the time of Nehemiah. After the completion of the wall of Jerusalem and the public reading of the Law, the people made a solemn covenant to follow God's commandments and to maintain the worship and service in the temple. 

Nehemiah, the governor, along with the priests, Levites, and leaders of the people, signed and sealed this covenant as a binding commitment to God \(Nehemiah 9:38\). Adonijah's inclusion in this list indicates his leadership role among the Levites and his dedication to the spiritual renewal of the community. 

The covenant included various obligations, such as observing the Sabbath, providing for the temple service, and refraining from intermarriage with the surrounding nations \(Nehemiah 10:28-39\). By sealing the covenant, Adonijah and the other leaders pledged themselves and the people to follow these commitments faithfully. 

Apart from this mention in the list of those who sealed the covenant, no other information is provided about Adonijah's specific role, background, or personal life. His participation in this significant event, however, highlights the importance of the Levites' leadership and their commitment to the spiritual well-being of the community during the post-exilic period.
