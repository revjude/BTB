Col-hozeh is mentioned in [[Neh.11.5|Nehemiah 11:5]] as an ancestor of Maaseiah, a descendant of Judah who settled in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. Maaseiah is described as the son of Baruch, the son of Col-hozeh. This Col-hozeh is likely a different individual from the father of Shallun mentioned in Nehemiah 3:15, given the different context and time period.
