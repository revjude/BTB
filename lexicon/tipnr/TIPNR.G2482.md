Italy is mentioned several times in the New Testament as a region in southern Europe, home to the Roman Empire. In Acts 18:2, we learn that Aquila, a Jew from Pontus, had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla due to the emperor Claudius' decree expelling all Jews from Rome. In Acts 27:1, 6, Paul embarks on his journey to Rome, sailing on ships from Alexandria and Adramyttium that were bound for Italy. The author of Hebrews also mentions Italy, sending greetings from those who had come from there \([[Heb.13.24|Hebrews 13:24]]\). Additionally, Acts 10:1 mentions the Italian Regiment, a Roman military unit stationed in Caesarea. These references highlight the significant role Italy played in the early spread of Christianity and its connection to the Roman Empire.
