Azbuk is mentioned in [[Neh.3.16|Nehemiah 3:16]] as the father of Nehemiah, who participated in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's wall during the time of Nehemiah the governor. This Nehemiah is not to be confused with the book's author, who was also named Nehemiah. Azbuk's son Nehemiah is described as repairing the section of the wall near the tombs of David, the house of the warriors, and the Water Gate. The fact that Nehemiah is identified by his father's name suggests that Azbuk was a well-known or respected figure in the community. The rebuilding of the wall was a significant project that required the participation and cooperation of many individuals and families, and Azbuk's son's involvement demonstrates the commitment of various families to the restoration of Jerusalem and its defenses.
