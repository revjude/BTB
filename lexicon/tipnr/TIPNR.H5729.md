<small>*In Assyria • A city or region, possibly in Mesopotamia or Syria.*</small>

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Eden</span>, a city or region mentioned in the Old Testament, possibly located in Mesopotamia or Syria \([[2Kgs.19.12|2 Kings 19:12]]; [[Isa.37.12|Isaiah 37:12]]; [[Ezek.27.23|Ezekiel 27:23]]\).
- A location in Assyria first mentioned at [[2Kgs.19.12|2Ki.19.12]]; 
- referred to as Eden **<big>[[H5729|עֶדֶן]]</big>**, or Edem \(LXX\)  **<big>[[H5729|עֶדֶן]]</big>**.

Eden, also spelled as Edem in the Septuagint \(LXX\), was a city or region mentioned in the Old Testament. It is referred to as a place conquered by the Assyrians \([[2Kgs.19.12|2 Kings 19:12]]; [[Isa.37.12|Isaiah 37:12]]\) and as a trading partner of Tyre \([[Ezek.27.23|Ezekiel 27:23]]\). The exact location of Eden is uncertain, but it was likely situated in Mesopotamia or Syria, given its association with the Assyrians and its trade relations with Tyre. It should not be confused with the Garden of Eden, as they are separate places. The biblical references to Eden provide little information about its history or significance, but its mention in the context of Assyrian conquests and Tyrian trade suggests that it was a place of some importance in the ancient Near East.
