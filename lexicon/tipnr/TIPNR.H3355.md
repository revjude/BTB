Joktan is mentioned in the genealogies of Genesis 10 and 1 Chronicles 1 as a descendant of Shem, the son of Noah. He was the son of Eber and the brother of Peleg \([[Gen.10.25|Gen.10.25]]; [[1Chr.1.19|1Ch.1.19]]\). The biblical record states that in the days of Peleg, the earth was divided, possibly referring to the division of languages and nations at the Tower of Babel \([[Gen.10.25|Gen.10.25]]\). 

Joktan is described as the ancestor of several Arabian tribes. [[Gen.10.26|Genesis 10:26]]-29 and [[1Chr.1.20|1 Chronicles 1:20]]-23 list his 13 sons: Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, Obal, Abimael, Sheba, Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. These names are associated with various regions in Arabia, suggesting that Joktan's descendants settled in the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula. 

The mention of Joktan and his sons in the Table of Nations \(Genesis 10\) serves to highlight the diversity of peoples and nations that descended from Noah's sons after the Flood. It also demonstrates the fulfillment of God's command to be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth \(Gen.9.1\). 

Although no further details are provided about Joktan's life or his relationship with his descendants, his inclusion in the biblical genealogies emphasizes the connection between the Semitic peoples and the Arabian tribes. It also underscores the importance of genealogical records in ancient Near Eastern societies for establishing family ties and tracing the origins of nations.
