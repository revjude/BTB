He is listed as one of the sons of Dishan, who was a son of Seir the Horite. The Horites were the original inhabitants of the land of Seir, which was later inhabited by the descendants of Esau, also known as the Edomites. The genealogies provide a record of the family lines and clans that lived in the region. Apart from these mentions in the genealogical lists, no further information is given about Aran, son of Dishan, in the biblical text.
