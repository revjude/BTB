Henadad, son of Bani, was a Levite who participated in the rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem under the leadership of Nehemiah. He is specifically mentioned as repairing a section of the wall, along with Binnui, son of Henadad \([[Neh.3.24|Neh.3.24]]\). The rebuilding of the wall was a significant project undertaken by Nehemiah to restore the security and integrity of Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. Henadad's involvement in this project demonstrates the participation of the Levites in the physical restoration of the city, in addition to their spiritual and religious duties. No further information is provided about this specific Henadad in the Bible. \([[Neh.3.24|Neh.3.24]]\).
