Seneh is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the context of Jonathan's daring attack on the Philistine garrison at Michmash \(1 Sam. 14:4\). Seneh was one of two rocky crags, the other being Bozez, between which Jonathan and his armor-bearer had to pass to reach the Philistine outpost. The name "Seneh" means "thorny" or "pointed" in Hebrew, suggesting that the crag was sharp and difficult to traverse. The passage describes the challenging terrain, with cliffs on both sides of the pass, emphasizing the bravery and faith of Jonathan and his companion as they ventured into enemy territory. Their successful attack on the Philistines, despite the odds, demonstrated their trust in God and inspired the Israelites to pursue and defeat the Philistine army.
