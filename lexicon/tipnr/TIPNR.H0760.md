Aram-zobah is mentioned in the title of Psalm 60, along with Aram-naharaim, as a region against which David fought. Zobah was an Aramean kingdom located in central Syria, north of Damascus. The Arameans of Zobah were among the enemies Israel faced during the time of the united monarchy. 

The title of the psalm suggests that David engaged in a military campaign against Aram-zobah, likely seeking to expand Israel's influence and control in the region. The conflict with Aram-zobah is also mentioned in 2 Samuel 8:3-8 and 1 Chronicles 18:3-8, which describe David's victories over Hadadezer, the king of Zobah, and his allies. 

David's success against Aram-zobah and the acquisition of valuable resources, such as gold, silver, and bronze, contributed to the strengthening of Israel's position and wealth during his reign. The mention of Aram-zobah in the psalm title serves as a reminder of David's military prowess and the challenges he faced in establishing Israel's dominance in the region.
