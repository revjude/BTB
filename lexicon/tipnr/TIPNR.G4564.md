Sarah, initially named Sarai, was the wife of Abraham and the mother of Isaac. She was born in Ur of the Chaldeans and married Abraham \(then known as Abram\) while they lived in Haran \([[Gen.11.29|Genesis 11:29]]-31\). Sarah accompanied Abraham when God called him to leave Haran and go to the land of Canaan \([[Gen.12.5|Genesis 12:5]]\). Despite God's promise that Abraham would have numerous descendants, Sarah was barren \([[Gen.11.30|Genesis 11:30]]\). In her impatience, she gave her Egyptian maidservant, Hagar, to Abraham as a wife to bear a child on her behalf \([[Gen.16.1|Genesis 16:1]]-4\). This resulted in the birth of Ishmael \([[Gen.16.1|Genesis 16:1]]5-16\). When Abraham was 99 years old, God reaffirmed His covenant with him, changed his name from Abram to Abraham, and changed Sarai's name to Sarah \(Genesis 17:5, 15\). God promised that Sarah would bear a son, Isaac, through whom the covenant would be established \([[Gen.17.19|Genesis 17:19]], 21; 18:10-14\). Sarah initially laughed at this idea due to her advanced age \([[Gen.18.12|Genesis 18:12]]-15\). However, as God had promised, Sarah conceived and gave birth to Isaac when she was 90 years old \(Genesis 21:1-7\). Sarah's faith is commended in [[Heb.11.11|Hebrews 11:11]], which states that she received the ability to conceive because she considered God faithful to His promise. Sarah died at the age of 127 in Kirjath-arba \(Hebron\), and Abraham purchased the cave of Machpelah as a burial site for her \(Genesis 23:1-20\). Her life story demonstrates the importance of faith, patience, and trust in God's promises, even in the face of seemingly impossible circumstances.
