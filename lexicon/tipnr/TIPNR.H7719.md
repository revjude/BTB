Shoham is mentioned in [[1Chr.24.27|1 Chronicles 24:27]] as a member of the Merarite Levite family of Jaaziah. This passage describes the organization of the Levitical service during the reign of King David. The Levites were divided into various clans and assigned specific duties in the tabernacle and, later, in the temple. Shoham is listed among the descendants of Merari, one of the three main branches of the Levites. The mention of Shoham in this context suggests that he and his family were involved in the Levitical service, although no specific role or responsibility is mentioned in the text.
