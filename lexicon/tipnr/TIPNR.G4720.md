Stachys is mentioned briefly in [[Rom.16.9|Romans 16:9]] as one of the individuals in Rome to whom Paul sends his greetings. Paul refers to Stachys as "my beloved" \(Greek: ton agapēton mou\), indicating a close personal relationship and affection between the two. 

The context of this greeting is found in the final chapter of Paul's letter to the Romans, where he extends personal greetings to various members of the church in Rome. This suggests that Stachys was a part of the Christian community in Rome and was known to Paul, either through personal interaction or by reputation. 

Although no further information is provided about Stachys in the biblical text, his inclusion in Paul's greetings indicates that he was a respected and valued member of the early church. The fact that Paul singles him out as a beloved friend suggests a strong bond of Christian love and fellowship between them.
