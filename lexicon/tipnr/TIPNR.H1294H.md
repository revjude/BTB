The Beracah Valley, meaning "Valley of Blessing," is mentioned in 2 Chronicles 20:26 in connection with King Jehoshaphat of Judah and his army. After the Lord had given them a miraculous victory over the Moabites, Ammonites, and Meunites, they assembled in the valley on the fourth day to praise and bless the Lord for His deliverance. As a result, they named the place "Beracah Valley." The exact location of the valley is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated somewhere between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea, in the vicinity of the battle. The Beracah Valley stands as a testament to God's faithfulness and the importance of acknowledging His hand in the victories of His people.
