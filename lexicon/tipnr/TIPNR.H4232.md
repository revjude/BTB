Mehujael is mentioned in the genealogy of Cain, the son of Adam and Eve who was cursed for murdering his brother Abel. Mehujael was the son of Irad and the father of Methushael \(Genesis 4:18\). He is part of the seventh generation from Adam through the line of Cain. The genealogy in Genesis 4 traces the descendants of Cain, highlighting the development of civilization and the increasing wickedness of humanity, which eventually led to the judgment of the flood. Mehujael's name is of Hebrew origin and can be translated as "smitten by God" or "blot out that Jah is God," possibly reflecting the growing rebellion against God among Cain's descendants.
