Puah was a minor judge of Israel mentioned briefly in [[Judg.10.1|Judges 10:1]]. He was the son of Dodo and came from the tribe of Issachar. After the death of Abimelech, who had ruled Israel for three years following the time of Gideon, Puah arose to judge Israel. He is described as being from Issachar and living in Shamir, in the hill country of Ephraim. The text does not provide any details about the length of Puah's judgeship or the specific events that occurred during his time as a judge. The mention of Puah in the succession of judges highlights the ongoing need for leadership and guidance among the Israelites during this turbulent period in their history. As a judge, Puah would have been responsible for settling disputes, administering justice, and providing military leadership when necessary.
