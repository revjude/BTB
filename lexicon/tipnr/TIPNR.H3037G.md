Jaddua is mentioned in [[Neh.10.21|Nehemiah 10:21]] as one of the leaders who sealed the covenant made by the people of Israel during the time of Nehemiah. This covenant was a solemn agreement to follow God's law, to avoid intermarriage with the surrounding nations, and to support the temple and its services \(Neh.10.28-39\). 

The list of leaders who sealed the covenant includes priests, Levites, and heads of families, indicating the widespread support for the renewal of the covenant among the people. Jaddua's inclusion in this list suggests that he held a position of authority and influence within the community. 

No other specific details are provided about Jaddua's life, family, or role. His participation in the sealing of the covenant, however, demonstrates his commitment to the spiritual and moral reformation of the Jewish community during the post-exilic period under Nehemiah's leadership.
