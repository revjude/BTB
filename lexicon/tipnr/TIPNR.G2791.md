Cilicia was a province located in the southeastern region of Asia Minor, modern-day Turkey. It was bounded by the Taurus Mountains to the north, separating it from Cappadocia, Lycaonia, and Isauria, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, Syria to the east, and Pamphylia to the west. 

In the New Testament, Cilicia is mentioned several times in connection with the apostle Paul. Paul was born in Tarsus, one of the chief cities of Cilicia \(Acts 21:39; 22:3\). After his conversion, Paul spent some time in Cilicia \([[Gal.1.21|Galatians 1:21]]; Acts 9:30\) and later revisited the region during his second missionary journey, strengthening the churches \(Acts 15:41\). 

Cilicia had a significant Jewish population, and the synagogue of the Cilicians in Jerusalem was among those who disputed with Stephen \(Acts 6:9\). The early Christian church spread to Cilicia, as evidenced by the letter addressed to the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia \(Acts 15:23\). 

Geographically, Cilicia was an important region, serving as a major trade route between Syria and the west. The Cilician Gates, a mountain pass through the Taurus Mountains, was a strategic point of travel and was likely used by Paul and Barnabas during their missionary journeys \(Acts 15:41\).
