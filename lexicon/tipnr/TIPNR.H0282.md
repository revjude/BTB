Ahihud, the son of Shelomi, was a leader chosen from the tribe of Asher to assist in the allocation of the Promised Land among the Israelite tribes. After the conquest of Canaan, God instructed Moses to appoint leaders from each tribe to help divide the land as an inheritance for the Israelites. \(Num.34.16-29\) 

Ahihud was selected as the representative for the tribe of Asher in this important task. His role was to work alongside Eleazar the priest, Joshua, and the other tribal leaders to ensure a fair and orderly distribution of the land according to God's direction.
