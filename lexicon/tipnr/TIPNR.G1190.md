Derbe was a city in the region of Lycaonia, located in modern-day Turkey. It was one of the cities visited by Paul and Barnabas during their first missionary journey after they were forced to flee from Iconium \(Acts 14:6\). In Derbe, they preached the gospel and made many disciples \(Acts 14:20-21\). On Paul's second missionary journey, he revisited Derbe, where he met Timothy, who became his faithful companion and co-worker \(Acts 16:1\). Gaius, one of Paul's travel companions, was also from Derbe \(Acts 20:4\). The city was located on the eastern edge of the Roman province of Galatia and was known for its fertile soil and agricultural production.
