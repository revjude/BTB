Greece, also known as Javan in the Old Testament, is mentioned several times in the Bible. In the book of Daniel, Greece is symbolized by a male goat in a vision \([[Dan.8.21|Daniel 8:21]]\) and is described as a kingdom that will rise after Persia \([[Dan.10.20|Daniel 10:20]]; 11:2\). The prophet Zechariah speaks of Judah being like a bow and Ephraim like an arrow against Greece \([[Zech.9.13|Zechariah 9:13]]\). Greece is also listed among the nations to which God will send survivors to proclaim His glory \([[Isa.66.19|Isaiah 66:19]]\). In Ezekiel's prophecy, Javan is mentioned as a trading partner of Tyre, providing slaves and bronze vessels \([[Ezek.27.13|Ezekiel 27:13]],19\). 

In the New Testament, Greece is mentioned as a region visited by Paul during his missionary journeys \(Acts 20:2\). The term "Hellenist" is used to describe Greek-speaking Jews who had adopted Greek culture \(Acts 6:1; 9:29; 11:20\). These references highlight the significant influence of Greek culture and language in the ancient world, as well as the tension between Greek and Jewish cultures during the time of the early church.
