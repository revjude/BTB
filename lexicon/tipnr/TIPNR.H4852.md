Mesha is mentioned in [[Gen.10.30|Genesis 10:30]] as one of the boundaries of the territory settled by the descendants of Joktan, son of Eber. The verse states that "their dwelling place was from Mesha as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east." This suggests that Mesha was located in the Arabian Peninsula, possibly in the western or southern region. However, the exact location of Mesha remains unknown, and no further details about the place are provided in the Bible.
