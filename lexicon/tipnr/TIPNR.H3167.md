Jahzeiah, son of Tikvah, is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Ezra.10.15|Ezra 10:15]]. He was one of the four men who opposed Ezra's command for the Israelites to divorce their foreign wives. After the Babylonian exile, Ezra led a reform to purify the Jewish community by separating from foreign influences. As part of this reform, he ordered the men of Israel to divorce their foreign wives. 

Jahzeiah, along with Jonathan son of Asahel, Meshullam, and Shabbethai, stood against this decision. However, their opposition was to no avail, and many innocent women and children were sent away. The name Jahzeiah means "Yahweh sees" in Hebrew, combining the shortened form of the divine name "Yah" with the verb "haza," meaning "to see" or "have a vision."
