Emek-keziz was a town located within the territory allotted to the tribe of Benjamin during the division of the Promised Land under Joshua \(Jos. 18:21\). It is mentioned only once in the Bible, and no further details about its history, size, or significance are provided. Its inclusion in the list of towns assigned to Benjamin suggests that it was one of the settlements that the tribe was responsible for occupying and defending.
