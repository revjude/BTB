Caesarea Philippi was a city located in the northern part of Israel, near the base of Mount Hermon. It is mentioned in the New Testament as the place where Jesus asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?" \([[Matt.16.13|Matthew 16:13]]; [[Mark.8.27|Mark 8:27]]\). In response, Simon Peter acknowledged Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of the living God \(Matthew 16:16\). 

The city was originally known as Paneas, named after the Greek god Pan. It was later rebuilt and renamed Caesarea Philippi by Philip the Tetrarch, son of Herod the Great, in honor of himself and the Roman emperor. The city was known for its temple dedicated to Pan and its proximity to a large spring that fed the Jordan River. 

Jesus' conversation with his disciples at Caesarea Philippi marked a turning point in his ministry. It was here that he began to reveal more openly his identity as the Messiah and his impending death and resurrection \(Matthew 16:21; Mark 8:31\). The location, with its pagan associations and Gentile population, also symbolized the expanding mission of the gospel beyond the Jewish people.
