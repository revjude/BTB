King living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Hur</span> was one of the five Midianite kings slain by the Israelites during the time of Moses.
- A Midianite king living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Num.31.8|Num.31.8]]; 
- only referred to as Hur<[[H2354H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>חו</span>ּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>\).

Hur is mentioned in [[Num.31.8|Numbers 31:8]] and [[Josh.13.21|Joshua 13:21]] as one of the five kings of Midian who were killed by the Israelites during the time of Moses. These kings were slain in battle as part of a divine judgment against the Midianites for their role in seducing the Israelites into idolatry and sexual immorality \(Numbers 25:1-18\). 

In Numbers 31, God commanded Moses to take vengeance on the Midianites. The Israelite army, led by Phinehas, went to war against Midian and killed all the men, including the five kings: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba \(Numbers 31:7-8\). 

The territory of these Midianite kings was later allocated to the tribes of Reuben and Gad as part of their inheritance in the Promised Land \([[Josh.13.21|Joshua 13:21]]\). This indicates that the defeat of these kings and the conquest of their land was a significant event in Israel's history, marking their victory over their enemies and the fulfillment of God's promise to give them the land of Canaan. 

The biblical account of Hur and the other Midianite kings serves as an example of God's judgment against those who oppose His people and lead them astray. It also demonstrates the importance of obedience to God's commands and the consequences of idolatry and immorality.
