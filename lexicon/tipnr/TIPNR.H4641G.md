Maaseiah was a Levite who served as a gatekeeper during the reign of King David \([[1Chr.15.18|1Ch.15.18]],20\). He is mentioned in the context of the transportation of the Ark of the Covenant from the house of Obed-Edom to Jerusalem. David organized a grand procession involving Levites, priests, and musicians to accompany the Ark \(1Ch.15.1-28\). Maaseiah is listed among the gatekeepers who were appointed to carry the Ark and to play musical instruments, such as harps and lyres, during the procession \([[1Chr.15.18|1Ch.15.18]],20\). The gatekeepers were responsible for guarding the entrances to the tabernacle and later the temple, ensuring that only authorized personnel could enter \(1Ch.9.17-27\). Maaseiah's participation in the transportation of the Ark and his role as a gatekeeper highlight the importance of the Levites' duties in the worship and service of God during David's reign.
