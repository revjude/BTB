Hanani is mentioned in [[1Chr.25.4|1 Chronicles 25:4]] and 25:25 as one of the temple musicians during the reign of King David. He was among the sons of Heman, the king's seer, who were appointed to prophesy with lyres, harps, and cymbals in the temple service. Hanani and his brothers were skilled musicians, trained in singing to the Lord. In the organization of the temple musicians, Hanani was assigned to the twenty-fifth division \([[1Chr.25.25|1 Chronicles 25:25]]\). The temple musicians played a crucial role in the worship services, providing music and leading the people in praise to God. The mention of Hanani in this context highlights the importance of music and worship in the temple during David's reign.
