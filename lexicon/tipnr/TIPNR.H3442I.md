Jeshua is mentioned in Ezra and Nehemiah as the leader of a group of Israelites who returned to Jerusalem from the Babylonian exile. He is listed among the first group of exiles who returned under the decree of King Cyrus of Persia. Jeshua's group, along with others, helped to resettle Jerusalem and the surrounding towns. The return of these exiles was a significant event in the history of Israel, as it marked the beginning of the restoration of Jewish life in the land after decades of captivity in Babylon.
