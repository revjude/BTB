Abronah was one of the campsites where the Israelites stopped during their wilderness wanderings after leaving Egypt, as recorded in [[Num.33.34|Numbers 33:34]]-35. It was located between Jotbathah and Ezion-geber, near the Gulf of Aqaba. The Israelites camped at Abronah as part of their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. No other details are provided about this location in the Bible. Its exact site is unknown, as is the meaning of the name Abronah. Like many of the wilderness campsites listed in Numbers 33, Abronah is only mentioned in this travel itinerary and played no other role in the biblical narrative.
