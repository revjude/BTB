Hazor, also known as Hazor-Ithnan, was a town located in the Negev region, in the southern part of the territory allocated to the tribe of Judah \(Josh 15:23,25\). No further details about this Hazor are provided in the Bible, and its exact location remains unknown. It should not be confused with the more prominent city of Hazor in northern Canaan.
