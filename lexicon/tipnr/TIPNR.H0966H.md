Bezek is mentioned in the Bible as the place where King Saul gathered the Israelite army before fighting against the Ammonites \([[1Sam.11.8|1 Samuel 11:8]]\). The Ammonites, led by King Nahash, had besieged the city of Jabesh-gilead and threatened to gouge out the right eye of all its inhabitants. Saul, recently anointed as king, summoned the Israelites to assemble at Bezek. He mustered an army of three hundred thousand men from Israel and thirty thousand from Judah. From Bezek, Saul led the army to Jabesh-gilead and defeated the Ammonites, saving the city and its people. The location of this Bezek is uncertain, but it may have been situated in the territory of Manasseh, west of the Jordan River. It is likely a different place from the Bezek mentioned in Judges 1:4-5.
