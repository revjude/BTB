- A man living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.36.25|Gen.36.25]]; 
- only referred to as Dishon<[[H1787H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ִּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יש</span>ֹׁ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ן</span>\); 
-  son of Anah<[[H6034]]>;

Dishon is mentioned in the genealogies of Esau's family in Genesis 36 and 1 Chronicles 1. He is listed as the son of Anah and the grandson of Seir the Horite \([[Gen.36.25|Genesis 36:25]]; 1 Chronicles 1:41\). 

Anah, Dishon's father, is noteworthy for having discovered hot springs in the wilderness while pasturing donkeys for his father, Zibeon \(Genesis 36:24\). This discovery may have been significant for the nomadic Horites, as hot springs could have provided a valuable water source in the arid region. 

Dishon's sons are listed as Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran \(Genesis 36:26; 1 Chronicles 1:41\). These genealogies demonstrate the intermingling of Esau's descendants with the Horites, as Esau's grandson, Esau's son Eliphaz's son, was also named Dishon \([[Gen.36.25|Genesis 36:25]]-26\). 

The Horites were the original inhabitants of Mount Seir, the region south of the Dead Sea, before Esau's descendants displaced them \(Deuteronomy 2:12\). The inclusion of Dishon and other Horite names in Esau's genealogy suggests that there was intermarriage between the two groups. 

Apart from these genealogical references, no further information is provided about Dishon or his specific role in the biblical narrative. His mention serves to trace the origins and relationships of the people living in the region of Edom during the time of the patriarchs.
