Chilion was the son of Elimelech and Naomi, from Bethlehem in Judah. He had a brother named Mahlon. During a famine, Elimelech, Naomi, and their two sons went to live in the country of Moab \(Ruth 1:1-2\). While in Moab, Chilion married a Moabite woman named Orpah, and Mahlon married Ruth \(Ruth 1:4\). Tragically, Elimelech, Chilion, and Mahlon died in Moab, leaving Naomi, Ruth, and Orpah as widows \(Ruth 1:3,5\). When Naomi decided to return to Judah, Orpah remained in Moab, while Ruth chose to accompany her mother-in-law \(Ruth 1:6-18\). Later, when Boaz redeemed the land that had belonged to Elimelech, he also acquired the right to marry Ruth and continue the lineage of Mahlon and Chilion \(Ruth 4:9-10\).
