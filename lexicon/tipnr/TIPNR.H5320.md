People from Naphtuh\(?\)

The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Naphtuhim</span> were descendants of Mizraim, son of Ham, who settled in northern Egypt.
- People from Naphtuh\(?\) of the Egyptians, first mentioned at [[Gen.10.13|Gen.10.13]]; 
- only referred to as Naphtuhim **<big>[[H5320|נַפְתֻּחִים]]</big>**; 
- descended from Egypt **<big>[[H4714|מִצְרַיִם]]</big>** along with Ludim **<big>[[H3866|לוּדִי]]</big>**, Anamim **<big>[[H6047|עֲנָמִים]]</big>**, Lehabim **<big>[[H3853|לְהָבִים]]</big>**, Pathrusim **<big>[[H6625|פַּתְרֻסִי]]</big>**, Casluhim **<big>[[H3695|כַּסְלֻחִים]]</big>** and Caphtorim **<big>[[H3732|כַּפְתֹּרִי]]</big>**.

The Naphtuhim are mentioned in the Table of Nations \(Genesis 10\) as one of the peoples descending from Mizraim, son of Ham \([[Gen.10.13|Genesis 10:13]], [[1Chr.1.11|1 Chronicles 1:11]]\). Mizraim was the ancestor of the Egyptians, so the Naphtuhim were one of the people groups that inhabited Egypt. Their exact location is uncertain, but some scholars place them in the Nile delta region of northern Egypt. No other details are given about their history or culture in the Bible. The Naphtuhim likely assimilated into Egyptian civilization over time.
