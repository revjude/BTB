- People from Anam\(?\) of the Egyptians, first mentioned at [[Gen.10.13|Gen.10.13]]; 
- only referred to as Anamim **<big>[[H6047|עֲנָמִים]]</big>**; 
- descended from Egypt **<big>[[H4714|מִצְרַיִם]]</big>** along with Ludim **<big>[[H3866|לוּדִי]]</big>**, Lehabim **<big>[[H3853|לְהָבִים]]</big>**, Naphtuhim **<big>[[H5320|נַפְתֻּחִים]]</big>**, Pathrusim **<big>[[H6625|פַּתְרֻסִי]]</big>**, Casluhim **<big>[[H3695|כַּסְלֻחִים]]</big>** and Caphtorim **<big>[[H3732|כַּפְתֹּרִי]]</big>**.

The Anamim were a people group mentioned in the Table of Nations, a genealogical record found in both Genesis and 1 Chronicles. They are listed as descendants of Mizraim, who was a son of Ham and grandson of Noah. The Table of Nations provides insight into the various people groups that emerged after the Flood and their geographical distribution. 

Little is known about the specific identity or location of the Anamim, as they are not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. Some scholars suggest that they may have settled in the region of North Africa, possibly in the area of modern-day Libya or Tunisia, based on their association with other descendants of Mizraim. However, due to the lack of further biblical or historical evidence, the exact identity and location of the Anamim remain uncertain.
