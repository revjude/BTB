Priest living at the time of United Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Phinehas</span>, the son of Eli the priest, was known for his wickedness and died in battle against the Philistines along with his brother Hophni.
- A priest living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Sam.1.3|1Sa.1.3]]; 
-  son of Eli \(H5941\); 
-  brother of Hophni \(H2652\); 
-  father of Ichabod \(H0350\), Ahitub \(H0285G\); called Phinehas  **<big>[[H6372|פִּינְחָס]]</big>**

Phinehas was one of the two sons of Eli, the priest who served in the tabernacle at Shiloh \([[1Sam.1.3|1 Samuel 1:3]]\). Along with his brother Hophni, Phinehas was described as a worthless man who did not know the Lord \(1 Samuel 2:12\). They abused their priestly duties by taking more than their share of the sacrificial meat and engaging in sexual immorality with the women who served at the entrance of the tabernacle \(1 Samuel 2:13-17, 22\). 

Eli rebuked his sons for their wicked behavior, but they did not listen \(1 Samuel 2:22-25\). As a result, a prophecy was given to Eli that his two sons would die on the same day \([[1Sam.2.34|1 Samuel 2:34]]\). This prophecy was fulfilled when the Philistines defeated the Israelites in battle, captured the Ark of the Covenant, and killed Hophni and Phinehas \([[1Sam.4.11|1 Samuel 4:11]]\). Upon hearing the news of his sons' deaths and the capture of the Ark, Eli fell backward, broke his neck, and died \([[1Sam.4.17|1 Samuel 4:17]]-18\). Phinehas' wife, who was pregnant, went into labor and died after giving birth to a son named Ichabod, which means "the glory has departed from Israel" \([[1Sam.4.19|1 Samuel 4:19]]-22\).
