Azariah is mentioned in [[2Chr.26.17|2 Chronicles 26:17]]-20 as the high priest who confronted King Uzziah of Judah when he attempted to burn incense in the temple, a task reserved for the priests. Azariah, accompanied by eighty brave priests, stood against the king and rebuked him for his transgression, reminding him that it was not his place to burn incense to the Lord. When Uzziah became angry and persisted in his attempt, God struck him with leprosy on his forehead. Azariah and the other priests then urged the king to leave the temple, and Uzziah remained leprous until the day of his death. This incident highlights the importance of respecting the boundaries between the roles of kings and priests and the consequences of overstepping those boundaries. Azariah's actions demonstrate the courage and faithfulness of the priesthood in upholding the laws of God, even in the face of royal opposition.
