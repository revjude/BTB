- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Mark.5.22|Mrk.5.22]]; 
- only referred to as Jairus<[[G2383]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ἰάειρος</span>\).

Jairus was a synagogue leader mentioned in the Gospels of Mark and Luke. He approached Jesus desperately seeking help for his critically ill daughter, who was about twelve years old. In [[Mark.5.22|Mark 5:22]]-23, Jairus fell at Jesus' feet and pleaded earnestly with him to come and lay hands on his daughter, believing that Jesus could heal her. While Jesus was on his way to Jairus' house, they received news that the girl had died. However, Jesus encouraged Jairus to have faith and continued to his home. There, Jesus took the girl by the hand and commanded her to get up, miraculously bringing her back to life \(Mark 5:41-42; Luke 8:54-55\). This event demonstrated Jesus' power over death and his compassion for those in need.
