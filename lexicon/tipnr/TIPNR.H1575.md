The Gamad are mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Ezek.27.11|Ezekiel 27:11]], as part of a prophetic oracle concerning the city of Tyre. In this passage, Ezekiel describes the wealth, splendor, and trade relationships of Tyre, portraying it as a prosperous and well-defended city. 

Among the various peoples and nations listed as contributing to Tyre's defense and commerce, the Gamad are specifically mentioned as being "in your towers." This suggests that they served as guards or watchmen on the city's fortifications, helping to protect Tyre from potential threats. 

The exact identity and origin of the Gamad are not provided in the biblical text, and there is limited historical or archaeological information about them outside of this single reference. Some scholars propose that they may have been a tribe or clan from the region around Tyre, possibly of Phoenician or Syrian origin, but this remains uncertain. 

The mention of the Gamad in Ezekiel's prophecy serves to underscore the extensive network of alliances and trade relationships that Tyre had established, as well as the city's formidable defenses. However, despite the presence of the Gamad and other defenders, Ezekiel's prophecy ultimately foretells the downfall and destruction of Tyre at the hands of its enemies.
