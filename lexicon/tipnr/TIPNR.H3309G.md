Japhia is mentioned in [[Josh.10.3|Joshua 10:3]] as the king of Lachish, one of the Amorite cities that formed an alliance against the Israelites during the conquest of Canaan. When the people of Gibeon made a peace treaty with Israel, Japhia joined forces with Adoni-Zedek, king of Jerusalem, and three other Amorite kings to attack Gibeon. In response, Joshua and the Israelite army came to Gibeon's defense and, with the help of God, defeated the Amorite kings and their armies \(Joshua 10:1-27\). Lachish, along with the other Amorite cities, was conquered by Joshua and the Israelites. The text does not provide any further details about Japhia's life or his fate after the battle.
