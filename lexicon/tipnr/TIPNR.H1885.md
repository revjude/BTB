Man living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Dathan</span>, a Reubenite, joined Korah's rebellion against Moses and Aaron and was punished by God. \([[Num.16.1|Num.16.1]],12,24,25,27,27; 26.9,9; Deu.11.6; Psa.106.17\)
- A man from the tribe of Reuben living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Num.16.1|Num.16.1]]; 
- only referred to as Dathan<[[H1885]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ָּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ת</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ן</span>\); 
-  son of Eliab<[[H0446H]]>; 
- a brother of Abiram<[[H0048G]]> and Nemuel<[[H5241G]]>.

Dathan, along with his brother Abiram, was a descendant of Reuben who joined Korah, a Levite, in rebelling against the authority of Moses and Aaron \([[Num.16.1|Numbers 16:1]]\). When Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, they refused to come, accusing Moses of failing to bring them into a land flowing with milk and honey \([[Num.16.1|Numbers 16:1]]2-14\). 

As the rebellion escalated, Moses warned the congregation to move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram \([[Num.16.24|Numbers 16:24]]-27\). God then caused the earth to open up and swallow Dathan, Abiram, and their households, along with Korah and his followers \(Numbers 16:31-35; Psalm 106:17\). 

The sons of Dathan and Abiram, however, did not die in this judgment \(Numbers 26:9-11\). The rebellion of Dathan and Abiram is remembered as a warning against defying God's appointed leaders \(Deuteronomy 11:6\).
