- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.4.8|Ezr.4.8]]; 
- only referred to as Shimshai **<big>[[H8124|שִׁמְשַׁי]]</big>**.

Shimshai is mentioned in [[Ezra.4.8|Ezra 4:8]], 9, 17, and 23 as a scribe who, together with Rehum the commander, opposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia. Shimshai and Rehum wrote a letter to the king, accusing the Jews of rebuilding the city and its walls, and claiming that this would lead to rebellion against the Persian Empire. In response to their letter, Artaxerxes ordered the work on the city to cease until further notice. Shimshai and Rehum, along with their associates, then went to Jerusalem and forcibly stopped the Jews from rebuilding the city. This opposition temporarily halted the reconstruction efforts until the reign of King Darius, who later allowed the Jews to resume their work on the temple and the city.
