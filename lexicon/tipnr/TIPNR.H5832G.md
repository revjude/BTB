Azarel is mentioned in 1 Chronicles 12 as one of the Danite warriors who joined David at Ziklag when he was fleeing from King Saul. The chapter lists the various groups of warriors from different tribes who allied themselves with David during this time, recognizing him as the future king of Israel. Azarel is specifically named among the Danites, along with Joezer, who are described as "captains of the army." The Danites were known for their military prowess, and their support would have been valuable to David as he sought to establish his kingdom. Azarel's presence in this list highlights the growing support for David among the tribes of Israel, even during his time of exile and conflict with Saul.
