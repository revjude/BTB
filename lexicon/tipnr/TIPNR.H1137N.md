- only referred to as Bani<[[H1137N]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>ָּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>\).

Bani is mentioned in [[Neh.10.14|Nehemiah 10:14]] as one of the leaders who sealed the covenant made during the time of Nehemiah. After the Israelites had returned from Babylonian exile and rebuilt the wall of Jerusalem, they gathered to confess their sins and commit to obeying God's law. Nehemiah 10 records the names of those who signed this agreement, including leaders, priests, Levites, and others. Bani's presence on this list indicates he held a position of authority and influence among the people. By sealing the covenant, he publicly declared his commitment to follow God's commandments and to support the spiritual and social reforms initiated by Nehemiah.
