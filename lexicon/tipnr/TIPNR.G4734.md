- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[1Cor.1.16|1Co.1.16]]; 
- referred to as Stephanas or \[ \] \(KJV= Stephanas\) <[[G4734]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Στεφανᾶς</span>\).

Stephanas was a member of the church in Corinth who is mentioned in [[1Cor.1.16|1 Corinthians 1:16]] and 16:15-17. He and his household were among the first converts in Achaia \(the region of Greece where Corinth was located\) and were baptized by Paul himself \([[1Cor.1.16|1 Corinthians 1:16]]\). 

In [[1Cor.16.15|1 Corinthians 16:15]], Paul commends the household of Stephanas for their dedication to the service of the saints. This suggests that Stephanas and his family were actively involved in ministering to the needs of the believers in Corinth and had distinguished themselves through their devotion and service. 

Later in the same chapter, Paul mentions that Stephanas, along with Fortunatus and Achaicus, had visited him and provided comfort and encouragement \([[1Cor.16.17|1 Corinthians 16:17]]-18\). Their presence was a source of joy and refreshment for Paul, who was facing challenges and opposition in his ministry. 

Paul urges the Corinthian church to submit to and acknowledge leaders like Stephanas, who had devoted themselves to the work of the ministry \(1 Corinthians 16:16\). This indicates that Stephanas was a respected leader in the Corinthian church, known for his service and commitment to the gospel. 

Overall, Stephanas emerges as an exemplary member of the early church, whose faith, service, and support were highly valued by Paul and the Corinthian believers.
