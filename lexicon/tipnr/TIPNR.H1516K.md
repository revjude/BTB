<small>*Valley of craftsmen; inhabited by Benjamites after the exile*</small>

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Ge-harashim</span>, the Valley of Craftsmen, was inhabited by some Benjamites after the return from the Babylonian exile.
- A location first mentioned at [[1Chr.4.14|1Ch.4.14]]; 
- referred to as Ge-harashim **<big>[[H1516|גַּיְא]]</big>** **<big>[[H1516|גַּיְא]]</big>**, or "valley/ of craftsmen" \(NIV= Ge-harashim\)  **<big>[[H2798|חֲרָשִׁים]]</big>** **<big>[[H1516|גַּיְא]]</big>**.

Ge-harashim, which means "Valley of Craftsmen" in Hebrew, is mentioned in two passages in the Bible. In [[1Chr.4.14|1 Chronicles 4:14]], Joab, the father of Ge-harashim, is listed among the descendants of Judah, specifically from the clan of Othniel. This suggests that the valley was associated with skilled artisans and craftsmen from the tribe of Judah. 

In [[Neh.11.35|Nehemiah 11:35]], Ge-harashim is mentioned again, this time in the context of the resettlement of Jerusalem and the surrounding towns after the Babylonian exile. The passage states that some of the Benjamites, along with people from Judah, settled in various towns, including Ge-harashim. 

The mention of Benjamites settling in Ge-harashim during the post-exilic period indicates that the valley had become a place of residence for people from different tribes, particularly those known for their craftsmanship and artisanal skills. 

The exact location of Ge-harashim is not specified in the Bible, but based on its association with the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, it is believed to have been situated somewhere in the Judean hill country, possibly near Jerusalem or in the Shephelah region. 

The name "Valley of Craftsmen" suggests that the area was known for its concentration of skilled artisans, possibly including metalworkers, potters, weavers, and other craftsmen. The presence of such a community would have been important for the economic and cultural life of the region, both before and after the Babylonian exile.
