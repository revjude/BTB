Eliashib is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.27|Ezra 10:27]] as one of the descendants of Zattu who had married foreign women. During the time of Ezra, many Israelites had intermarried with the pagan inhabitants of the land. Ezra called for a reform, urging those who had married foreign wives to separate from them. Eliashib was among the Israelites who had taken foreign wives, contrary to God's law. As part of the reform, Eliashib and the other Israelites pledged to put away their foreign wives and children.
