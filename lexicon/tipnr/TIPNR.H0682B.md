Azal is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Zech.14.5|Zechariah 14:5]], as part of a prophetic vision concerning the Day of the Lord. In this passage, Zechariah describes a time when the Lord will stand on the Mount of Olives, causing it to split in two, with half of the mountain moving north and half moving south. The people are then instructed to flee to the valley between the mountains, which will reach "to Azal." The exact location of Azal is unknown, but based on the context, it appears to be a place near Jerusalem, possibly a village or landmark in the vicinity of the Mount of Olives.
