Shimei from Ramah is mentioned in [[1Chr.27.27|1 Chronicles 27:27]] as the overseer of King David's vineyards. This chapter lists the various officials and administrators responsible for managing the king's assets and resources. As the overseer of the vineyards, Shimei would have been responsible for the cultivation, maintenance, and production of the royal vineyards. His association with Ramah, a city in the territory of Benjamin, suggests that he may have originated from that area.
