Dimonah was a city located in the Negev region, the southern part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Judah \([[Josh.15.22|Joshua 15:22]]\). It is mentioned only once in the Bible, along with other cities in the Negev. The exact location of Dimonah is unknown, but it was likely situated in the arid wilderness south of Hebron. As one of the cities in the Negev, Dimonah would have faced the challenges of limited water resources and harsh desert conditions. The name "Dimonah" may be related to the Hebrew word "dam," meaning "blood," but the significance of this connection is unclear.
