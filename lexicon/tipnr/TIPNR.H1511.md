The Girzites are mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[1Sam.27.8|1 Samuel 27:8]]. While David was living in the Philistine city of Ziklag, he and his men went on raids against the Girzites, along with the Geshurites and the Amalekites. These groups were described as having inhabited the land "from Telam as far as Shur, to the east of Egypt." David attacked these groups, leaving no survivors, and took their possessions, including livestock and clothing. The exact location and identity of the Girzites remain unknown, as they are not mentioned in any other historical or biblical records.
