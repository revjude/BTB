Michri is briefly mentioned in the book of 1 Chronicles as a Benjamite who lived in Jerusalem \([[1Chr.9.8|1Ch.9.8]]\). He is listed among the descendants of Benjamin who settled in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. The context of 1 Chronicles 9 provides a genealogical record of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, including the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh \(1Ch.9.3\). No further details about Michri's life, family, or role in the community are provided in the biblical text. His mention serves to document the Benjamites who resided in Jerusalem during the post-exilic period.
