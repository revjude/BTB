Gog is a name that appears in the prophetic literature of the Bible, particularly in the books of Ezekiel and Revelation. In Ezekiel, Gog is described as the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, lands associated with the regions of Asia Minor \([[Ezek.38.2|Ezekiel 38:2]], 3\). Gog is portrayed as a powerful enemy who will lead a coalition of nations in an attack against Israel in the latter days \([[Ezek.38.14|Ezekiel 38:14]]-16\). However, God will intervene and defeat Gog and his armies, demonstrating His power and sovereignty \([[Ezek.38.18|Ezekiel 38:18]]-23; 39:1-6\). The prophecy also mentions that Gog's forces will be buried in a place called the Valley of Hamon-gog, and the land will be cleansed \(Ezekiel 39:11-16\). In the book of Revelation, Gog and Magog are mentioned together, representing the nations that will be deceived by Satan and gather for battle against God's people at the end of the millennial reign \([[Rev.20.8|Revelation 20:8]]\). The names Gog and Magog are symbolic, representing the final enemies of God's kingdom who will be ultimately defeated. The prophecies concerning Gog emphasize God's sovereignty, the certainty of His judgment against His enemies, and the ultimate victory of His people.
