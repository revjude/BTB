- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.10.22|Neh.10.22]]; 
- only referred to as Hanan<[[H2605L]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ח</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ן</span>\).

Hanan is mentioned in [[Neh.10.22|Nehemiah 10:22]] as one of the Levites who signed the covenant led by Nehemiah to follow the Law of God. After the completion of the wall of Jerusalem and the public reading of the Law, the people of Israel made a solemn covenant to obey God's commandments and to support the temple service \(Nehemiah 9-10\). The covenant was sealed by the signatures of the leaders, priests, and Levites, including Hanan. This event demonstrated the commitment of the post-exilic community to God and their determination to live according to His laws.
