Beth-anoth is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Josh.15.59|Joshua 15:59]], as part of the list of cities and villages in the hill country of Judah. The name Beth-anoth means "house of answers" or "house of affliction" in Hebrew. The town is listed along with other cities such as Halhul, Beth-zur, and Gedor. The exact location of Beth-anoth is not specified in the Bible, but it was situated in the hill country of Judah, which is the central mountainous region of the Promised Land.
