Dibon, also called Dibon-gad, was a city located in the region of Moab, north of the Arnon River. It was originally inhabited by the Moabites \([[Num.21.30|Numbers 21:30]]\) but was later conquered by the Israelites and allotted to the tribe of Gad \([[Num.32.3|Numbers 32:3]], 34; [[Josh.13.9|Joshua 13:9]], 17\). The Gadites rebuilt and fortified the city \([[Num.32.3|Numbers 32:3]]4\). However, Dibon was later repossessed by the Moabites \([[Isa.15.2|Isaiah 15:2]]; [[Jer.48.18|Jeremiah 48:18]], 22\). The city is mentioned in the famous Mesha Stele \(Moabite Stone\), which records the victories of King Mesha of Moab against Israel. Dibon is also associated with the "waters of Dimon" in Isaiah 15:9, possibly referring to a nearby river or stream. The city was one of the stopping points during the Israelites' wilderness wanderings \([[Num.33.45|Numbers 33:45]]-46\).
