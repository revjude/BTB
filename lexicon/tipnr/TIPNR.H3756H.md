Carmi, the son of Zabdi, was a member of the tribe of Judah and the father of Achan \([[Josh.7.1|Joshua 7:1]], 18; [[1Chr.2.7|1 Chronicles 2:7]]\). After the Israelites conquered Jericho, Achan took some of the devoted things from the city, which were supposed to be dedicated to God. This act of disobedience brought God's anger upon the Israelites, causing them to suffer defeat in their next battle against Ai. When Joshua sought the Lord's guidance, God revealed that someone had taken from the devoted things. Through a process of elimination, Achan was identified as the culprit. Achan confessed his sin and was punished by being stoned to death along with his family and livestock, and their remains were burned \([[Josh.7.1|Joshua 7:1]]9-26\). Carmi's mention in this narrative serves to identify Achan's lineage and emphasize the consequences of disobedience to God's commands.
