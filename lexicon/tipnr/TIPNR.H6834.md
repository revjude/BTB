Zippor was the father of Balak, the king of Moab who opposed the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness. He is mentioned several times in the account of Balak's attempts to curse Israel through the prophet Balaam \(Numbers 22-24\). Zippor's name, which means "bird" or "sparrow," is consistently used in conjunction with Balak's name, emphasizing his role as the king's father. Although little is known about Zippor's life, his son Balak's actions suggest that he may have shared the same hostility towards the Israelites. In [[Josh.24.9|Joshua 24:9]] and [[Judg.11.25|Judges 11:25]], Zippor is mentioned in the context of recounting Israel's past conflicts with Moab, further highlighting the significance of his son's opposition to Israel. Some scholars speculate that Zippor may have been the "former king of Moab" mentioned in Numbers 21:26, but this is not explicitly stated in the text.
