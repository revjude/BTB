<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Jaakobah</span> was a leader from the tribe of Simeon during the reign of King Hezekiah \([[1Chr.4.36|1Ch.4.36]]\).
- A man from the tribe of Simeon\(?\) living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.4.36|1Ch.4.36]]; 
- only referred to as Jaakobah **<big>[[H3291|יַעֲקֹבָה]]</big>**.

Jaakobah is mentioned in [[1Chr.4.36|1 Chronicles 4:36]] as one of the leaders from the tribe of Simeon during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. He is listed along with other Simeonite leaders, including Elioenai, Jaakobah, Jeshohaiah, Asaiah, Adiel, Jesimiel, and Benaiah. 

These leaders are described as "mighty men of valor" \(1Ch.4.38\), indicating their strength and bravery. They sought to expand their territory by going to the entrance of Gedor, east of the valley, in search of pasture for their flocks \(1Ch.4.39\). 

The Simeonites, under the leadership of Jaakobah and the others, successfully conquered the land and settled there, as it provided rich pasture for their livestock \(1Ch.4.40-41\). This event likely took place during the reign of King Hezekiah, who initiated religious reforms and sought to restore the nation's faithfulness to God. 

No other specific details are given about Jaakobah's life or role within the tribe. His inclusion in this narrative highlights the importance of strong leadership and the expansion of Israelite territory during this period in history.
