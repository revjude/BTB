Allammelech is mentioned in [[Josh.19.26|Joshua 19:26]] as one of the towns allotted to the tribe of Asher during the division of the Promised Land. It is listed among other cities and territories given to Asher in the western part of Canaan. The exact location of Allammelech is not specified in the Bible, and it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Scriptures. Its inclusion in the list of Asher's towns suggests that it was a part of their tribal inheritance.
