Meshech-Tubal is a combined reference to the nations of Meshech and Tubal, which are often mentioned together in the Bible. In [[Ezek.32.26|Ezekiel 32:26]], Meshech-Tubal is listed among the nations that have been defeated by the Babylonians and lie in the grave with the uncircumcised. The verse states, "There are Meshech and Tubal and all their multitudes, with their graves all around it." This passage is part of a larger prophecy against Egypt, which describes the fate of various nations that have fallen by the sword. The mention of Meshech-Tubal in this context suggests that they were once powerful nations that met their downfall at the hands of the Babylonians.
