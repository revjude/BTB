Eubulus is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Paul's second letter to Timothy \([[2Tim.4.21|2 Timothy 4:21]]\). He is one of several individuals who sent greetings to Timothy through Paul. The mention of Eubulus alongside other believers suggests that he was a member of the Christian community known to both Paul and Timothy.
