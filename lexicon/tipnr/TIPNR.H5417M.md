Nethanel was a Levite leader during the reign of King Josiah of Judah. He was one of the Levites who contributed large numbers of animals for Josiah's famous Passover celebration \([[2Chr.35.9|2 Chronicles 35:9]]\). This Passover was part of Josiah's reforms and his effort to centralize worship in Jerusalem in obedience to the Book of the Law that had been found. As a Levite leader, Nethanel would have had oversight of other Levites.
