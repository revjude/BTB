Haman is the primary antagonist in the book of Esther. He was an Agagite, a descendant of the Amalekite kings, and a high-ranking official in the Persian Empire during the reign of King Ahasuerus \(Xerxes I\). Haman was promoted to a position of authority and commanded all the royal officials to bow down to him \([[Esth.3.1|Esther 3:1]]-2\). However, Mordecai, a Jew, refused to bow to Haman \([[Esth.3.2|Esther 3:2]]-4\). Enraged, Haman plotted to destroy not only Mordecai but all the Jews in the empire \(Esther 3:5-6\). He convinced the king to issue a decree ordering the extermination of the Jews \([[Esth.3.8|Esther 3:8]]-15\). Haman also had a gallows built to hang Mordecai \([[Esth.5.14|Esther 5:14]]\). However, Haman's plans were thwarted by Queen Esther, who revealed her Jewish identity to the king and exposed Haman's plot \([[Esth.7.1|Esther 7:1]]-6\). The king ordered Haman to be hanged on the very gallows he had prepared for Mordecai \([[Esth.7.7|Esther 7:7]]-10\). Haman's ten sons were also executed \([[Esth.9.10|Esther 9:10]]-14\). The king then issued a new decree, allowing the Jews to defend themselves against their enemies \([[Esth.8.1|Esther 8:1]]-14\). Haman's story serves as a powerful example of how God can use individuals to protect His people and bring about justice, even in the face of great adversity.
