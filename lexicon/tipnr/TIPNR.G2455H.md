Judas Iscariot was one of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ, known for his betrayal of Jesus, which led to His arrest and crucifixion. He is consistently identified as "Judas Iscariot" or "Judas, the one who betrayed Him" throughout the Gospels \([[Matt.10.4|Matthew 10:4]]; 26:14; [[Mark.3.19|Mark 3:19]]; [[Luke.6.16|Luke 6:16]]; [[John.6.71|John 6:71]]\). 

Judas is first mentioned in the lists of the twelve apostles \([[Matt.10.4|Matthew 10:4]]; [[Mark.3.19|Mark 3:19]]; [[Luke.6.16|Luke 6:16]]\). He served as the treasurer for the group, but he was also described as a thief who would take money from the common purse \([[John.12.4|John 12:4]]-6\). 

During the Last Supper, Jesus predicted that one of His disciples would betray Him \(Matthew 26:21; Mark 14:18; Luke 22:21; [[John.13.2|John 13:2]]1\). Judas was identified as the betrayer when Jesus handed him a piece of bread \([[John.13.2|John 13:2]]6-27\). After this, Judas left to carry out his plan \(John 13:30\). 

Judas approached the chief priests and offered to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver \([[Matt.26.14|Matthew 26:14]]-16; [[Mark.14.10|Mark 14:10]]-11; [[Luke.22.3|Luke 22:3]]-6\). He then led a group of armed men to the Garden of Gethsemane, where he identified Jesus with a kiss, leading to His arrest \([[Matt.26.47|Matthew 26:47]]-50; [[Mark.14.43|Mark 14:43]]-46; [[Luke.22.47|Luke 22:47]]-48; [[John.18.2|John 18:2]]-5\). 

After Jesus' condemnation, Judas, filled with remorse, tried to return the money to the chief priests and elders, but they refused to accept it. He then threw the money into the temple and went out and hanged himself \([[Matt.27.3|Matthew 27:3]]-5\). The chief priests used the money to buy a potter's field, which became known as the Field of Blood \(Matthew 27:6-10; Acts 1:18-19\). 

The apostles later recognized Judas' betrayal as a fulfillment of prophecy \(Acts 1:16\) and chose Matthias to replace him among the twelve \(Acts 1:23-26\). 

Judas' betrayal of Jesus played a crucial role in the events leading to Jesus' crucifixion and the ultimate fulfillment of God's plan of salvation. His actions serve as a tragic example of the consequences of greed, deceit, and turning away from God.
