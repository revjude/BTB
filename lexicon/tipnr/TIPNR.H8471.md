Tahpanhes \(also known as Tehaphnehes or Tahapanes\) was an important Egyptian city mentioned by the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel. It was located in Lower Egypt, near the eastern border. After the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC, Jewish refugees, including the prophet Jeremiah, fled to Tahpanhes \(Jer. 43:7\). Jeremiah prophesied that Nebuchadnezzar would invade Egypt and bring destruction upon Tahpanhes and other Egyptian cities where the Jewish refugees had settled \(Jer. 46:14\). Ezekiel also foretold the destruction of Tahpanhes when Nebuchadnezzar would strike Egypt \(Ezek. 30:18\). The city was known for its large foreign population, including a garrison of Greek mercenaries established by Pharaoh Psammetichus I. Tahpanhes is also mentioned as a witness to the desolation of the cities of Judah \(Jer. 44:1\). The name "Tahpanhes" is of Egyptian origin and may mean "Fortress of the Nubian" or "Fortress of Pinehas."
