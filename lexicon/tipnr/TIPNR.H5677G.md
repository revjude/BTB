Eber is a significant figure in the genealogies of the Bible, mentioned in Genesis, Numbers, 1 Chronicles, and Luke. He is a descendant of Shem, the son of Noah, and an ancestor of Abraham, making him an important link in the lineage of the Israelites. 

In the Table of Nations \(Genesis 10\), Eber is listed as a descendant of Shem, through his great-grandson Arpachshad \([[Gen.10.21|Genesis 10:21]],24\). Eber is also mentioned as the father of Peleg and Joktan \([[Gen.10.25|Genesis 10:25]]\). The division of the earth is mentioned in connection with Peleg, which some interpret as a reference to the scattering of people after the Tower of Babel incident. 

Eber's lineage is further detailed in [[Gen.11.14|Genesis 11:14]]-17, which records his age at the birth of his son Peleg \(34 years\), the length of his life after Peleg's birth \(430 years\), and his total lifespan \(464 years\). This places Eber in the context of the postdiluvian patriarchs, who lived extraordinarily long lives. 

In [[Num.24.24|Numbers 24:24]], Eber is mentioned in Balaam's prophetic oracle, where "ships from the coast of Kittim" are said to afflict Asshur and Eber. This suggests that Eber's descendants, the Hebrews, would face opposition from maritime powers. 

Eber is also listed in the genealogies of [[1Chr.1.18|1 Chronicles 1:18]],19,25 and [[Luke.3.35|Luke 3:35]], confirming his importance in the ancestral line of the Israelites. His name is often associated with the term "Hebrew," which some scholars believe is derived from his name, designating his descendants as "Hebrews."
