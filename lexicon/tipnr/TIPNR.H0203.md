On was a Reubenite who joined Korah, a Levite, in his rebellion against the leadership of Moses and Aaron \([[Num.16.1|Numbers 16:1]]\). Along with Dathan and Abiram, also Reubenites, On supported Korah's challenge to the divinely appointed authority of Moses and Aaron. The rebellion was motivated by a desire for greater power and influence within the Israelite community. However, God intervened and punished the rebels, causing the earth to open up and swallow them and their households \(Numbers 16:31-33\). On's participation in this rebellion highlights the importance of submitting to God-ordained leadership and the consequences of rebelling against it.
