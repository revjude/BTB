Neah, also known as Neiel, was a town located on the border between the tribal territories of Zebulun and Asher \(Josh. 19:13, 27\). It is mentioned only in the context of defining the boundaries of these tribes during the allotment of the land under Joshua. The exact location of Neah is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the western Galilee region, near the Mediterranean coast.
