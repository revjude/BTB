Shaul \(or Joel\), mentioned in [[1Chr.6.24|1 Chronicles 6:24]] and 6:36, was a Levite who descended from Kohath, one of the sons of Levi. In the genealogical records of the Levites, Shaul is listed as the son of Uzziah and the father of Uriel. The name Shaul is used in verse 24, while Joel is used in verse 36, likely due to textual variations or scribal differences. The Kohathites were one of the major divisions of the Levites and were responsible for carrying the sacred objects of the tabernacle during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness. The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 6 traces the lineage of the Levites, particularly the descendants of Kohath, highlighting their important role in the religious life of Israel. The mention of Shaul \(or Joel\) in this genealogy establishes his place within the Levitical lineage and emphasizes the continuity of the Kohathite family in their sacred duties.
