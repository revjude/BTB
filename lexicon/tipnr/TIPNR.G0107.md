Azor is mentioned in [[Matt.1.13|Matthew 1:13]]-14 as an ancestor of Jesus Christ in the genealogy recorded in the Gospel of Matthew. This genealogy traces the lineage of Jesus from Abraham through his earthly father, Joseph. Azor is listed as the son of Eliakim and the father of Zadok, placing him in the period after the Babylonian exile. The inclusion of Azor in the genealogy of Jesus emphasizes the continuity of the Messianic line and the fulfillment of God's promises through the generations. The genealogy in Matthew serves to establish Jesus' legal claim to the throne of David and to demonstrate his connection to the patriarchs and prophets of Israel.
