Zebulun was the tenth son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and the sixth and last son of Leah. He was born in Paddan-aram, and his name is derived from the Hebrew word meaning "honor" or "dwelling." The tribe of Zebulun played a significant role in Israel's history, being one of the twelve tribes that settled in the Promised Land. During the wilderness wanderings, the tribe of Zebulun was led by Eliab, son of Helon, and was positioned with the tribes of Judah and Issachar on the east side of the tabernacle. In the census taken in the wilderness, the tribe of Zebulun numbered 57,400 men of fighting age. 

The territory allotted to Zebulun was in the northern part of Canaan, bordered by Asher, Naphtali, and Issachar. It included the fertile plain of Jezreel and the coastal region along the Mediterranean Sea. The tribe of Zebulun was commended for their bravery and willingness to fight, as evidenced by their participation in the battles against Sisera and the Midianites. They were also known for their maritime skills and engaged in trade and commerce. 

Notable members of the tribe of Zebulun include Elon, who judged Israel for ten years, and Ibzan of Bethlehem, who was buried in the territory of Zebulun. The prophet Jonah also hailed from Gath-hepher, a town within Zebulun's borders. 

In the future distribution of the land described by Ezekiel, Zebulun is allocated a portion in the far north of Israel, with its boundaries stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River. The tribe of Zebulun is also mentioned in the book of Revelation as one of the twelve tribes sealed by God.
