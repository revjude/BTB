Aram is mentioned in the genealogy of Abraham's family, found in Genesis 22. He is listed as the son of Kemuel, who was the son of Abraham's brother Nahor and his wife Milcah. This makes Aram the nephew of Abraham. The genealogy is provided in the context of Abraham sending his servant to find a wife for his son Isaac from among his relatives in Mesopotamia. Apart from this mention in the genealogical list, no further information is given about Aram, son of Kemuel, in the biblical text.
