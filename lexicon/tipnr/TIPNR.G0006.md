Man living at the time before the Flood

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Abel</span>, the second son of Adam and Eve, was a shepherd who was killed by his brother Cain.
- A man living at the time before the Flood, first mentioned at Gen.4.2; 
- referred to as Abel **<big>[[H1893|הֶבֶל]]</big>**, or Abel **<big>[[G0006|Ἄβελ]]</big>**; 
-  son of Adam **<big>[[H0121|אָדָם]]</big>** and Eve **<big>[[H2332|חַוָּה]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Cain **<big>[[H7014|קַיִן]]</big>** and Seth **<big>[[H8352|שֵׁת]]</big>**.

Abel was the second son of Adam and Eve, born after his brother Cain. He was a shepherd, while Cain was a farmer. Both brothers brought offerings to God, but God accepted Abel's offering and rejected Cain's. This led to Cain's jealousy and anger, and he killed Abel in a field. 

God confronted Cain about Abel's murder, and as a result, Cain was cursed to be a wanderer on the earth. The New Testament references Abel as an example of faith \([[Heb.11.4|Hebrews 11:4]]\) and as a righteous man whose blood cried out for justice \([[Matt.23.35|Matthew 23:35]]; [[Luke.11.51|Luke 11:51]]\). Abel's blood is also contrasted with the blood of Jesus, which speaks of better things \([[Heb.12.24|Hebrews 12:24]]\). After Abel's death, Adam and Eve had another son named Seth.
