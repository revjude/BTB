Hazor was the largest and most important city in Canaan during the time of Joshua, serving as the head of the northern Canaanite kingdoms \(Josh 11:10\). Its king, Jabin, led a coalition against Israel, but was defeated by Joshua, who captured and destroyed Hazor \(Josh 11:1,10-11,13\). The city was allotted to the tribe of Naphtali \(Josh 19:36\). Hazor later revived and oppressed Israel, but was defeated by Deborah and Barak \(Judg 4:2,17\). The city was fortified by Solomon \(1 Kgs 9:15\) and was one of the first cities captured by Tiglath-pileser III of Assyria during his invasion of Israel \(2 Kgs 15:29\). Excavations at Tel Hazor have revealed a large, heavily fortified city with Canaanite temples and palaces, as well as evidence of destruction by fire, possibly corroborating the biblical account of Joshua's conquest.
