The Hall of the Throne is mentioned in the description of King Solomon's palace complex and appears to be another name for the Hall of Judgment. In 1 Kings 7:7, it is stated that Solomon built the Hall of Judgment, where he was to judge, and it was paneled with cedar from floor to ceiling. The verse then refers to this hall as the "Hall of the Throne," indicating that the two names refer to the same room. The throne mentioned here likely refers to the royal throne from which Solomon would sit and administer justice. As the king of Israel, Solomon's throne represented his authority and his role as the supreme judge in the land. The Hall of the Throne, therefore, served as the official space where Solomon exercised his judicial responsibilities and made decisions that impacted the lives of his subjects. The use of cedar paneling in the hall added to its grandeur and significance, reflecting the importance of the king's role and the solemnity of the proceedings that took place there. Beyond this brief mention in the description of Solomon's palace, no further details are provided about specific events or judgments that occurred in the Hall of the Throne.
