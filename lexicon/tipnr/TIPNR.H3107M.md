Jozabad is mentioned in [[Ezra.8.33|Ezra 8:33]] as one of the priests appointed to weigh the silver, gold, and vessels brought as offerings to the temple in Jerusalem. The context of the passage is Ezra's journey from Babylon to Jerusalem, during which he and his companions transported these offerings \(Ezra 8:24-34\). 

Upon their arrival in Jerusalem, the silver, gold, and vessels were weighed and entrusted to the care of specific priests and Levites. Jozabad, son of Jeshua, along with Noadiah, son of Binnui, were the priests appointed to weigh and record the offerings \([[Ezra.8.33|Ezra 8:33]]\). 

The careful weighing and recording of the offerings demonstrated the importance of accountability and stewardship in handling the resources dedicated to the temple.
