- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Phil.4.3|Php.4.3]]; 
- only referred to as Clement **<big>[[G2815|Κλήμης]]</big>**.

Clement is mentioned in [[Phil.4.3|Philippians 4:3]] as one of Paul's fellow laborers in the gospel. Paul describes Clement, along with others, as having his name in the Book of Life, indicating his faithful service and commitment to Christ. Paul's appeal to the Philippians to help these individuals suggests that they had faced some challenges or conflicts in their ministry. The mention of Clement's name implies that he was known to the Philippian church and had played a significant role in spreading the gospel alongside Paul. No further details about Clement's life or specific ministry activities are provided in the Bible. Some early church traditions identify this Clement as the same person as Clement of Rome, an early church father, but this connection cannot be conclusively established from the biblical text alone.
