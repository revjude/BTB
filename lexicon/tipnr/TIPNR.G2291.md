Terah was the son of Nahor and the father of Abraham, Nahor, and Haran \([[Gen.11.24|Genesis 11:24]]-26\). He lived in Ur of the Chaldeans, where he worshipped idols \([[Josh.24.2|Joshua 24:2]]\). At age 70, he became the father of his three sons \([[Gen.11.26|Genesis 11:26]]\). After Haran died in Ur, Terah took Abraham, Sarah, and Lot and set out for Canaan, but they settled in the city of Haran instead \([[Gen.11.31|Genesis 11:31]]\). Terah died in Haran at the age of 205 \(Genesis 11:32\). Jewish tradition portrays Terah as an idolater who turned to God. The Bible does not provide further details about his life, but his significance lies in being the father of Abraham, the recipient of God's covenant promises.
