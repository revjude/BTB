<small>*Male • Opponent of Paul, along with Hymenaeus*</small>

Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Alexander</span>, along with Hymenaeus, was an opponent of Paul's teaching and was handed over to Satan by Paul. \([[1Tim.1.20|1Ti.1.20]]; [[2Tim.4.14|2Ti.4.14]]\)
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[1Tim.1.20|1Ti.1.20]]; 
- only referred to as Alexander<[[G0223J]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ἀλέξανδρος</span>\).

Alexander is mentioned by Paul in his letters to Timothy as an individual who opposed his teaching and caused him harm. In the first letter to Timothy, Paul writes that he had handed Alexander and Hymenaeus over to Satan, so that they might learn not to blaspheme. \([[1Tim.1.20|1Ti.1.20]]\) 

Hymenaeus and Alexander had apparently departed from the truth and were promoting false teachings that were contrary to Paul's message. By handing them over to Satan, Paul was likely indicating that he had removed them from the protection and fellowship of the church, allowing them to experience the consequences of their actions and hopefully leading them to repentance. 

In the second letter to Timothy, written near the end of Paul's life, he mentions Alexander the coppersmith, who had done him great harm and strongly opposed his message. \([[2Tim.4.14|2Ti.4.14]]\) It is not clear whether this is the same Alexander mentioned in the first letter, but both individuals are portrayed as antagonists to Paul and his ministry. 

Paul warns Timothy to be on guard against Alexander, suggesting that he posed a significant threat to the church and its teachings. Paul also expresses his trust in God's justice, stating that the Lord will repay Alexander for his actions. \([[2Tim.4.14|2Ti.4.14]]\) 

These passages highlight the challenges and opposition that Paul and the early church faced from individuals who sought to undermine the gospel message and promote false teachings. They also demonstrate Paul's commitment to maintaining the purity of the church's doctrine and his willingness to take disciplinary action when necessary.
