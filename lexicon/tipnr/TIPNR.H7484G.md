Raamah is mentioned in the genealogy of the nations in Genesis 10, also known as the Table of Nations \(Genesis 10:7; [[1Chr.1.9|1 Chronicles 1:9]]\). He was a son of Cush, who was a son of Ham, making Raamah a grandson of Ham and a great-grandson of Noah. The Table of Nations records the descendants of Noah's sons and their dispersal after the Tower of Babel. Raamah's sons, Sheba and Dedan, are also mentioned, suggesting that they became ancestors of tribes or nations. Some scholars associate Raamah with a region in southern Arabia, based on the connection with Sheba and Dedan, which are often linked to Arabian tribes. However, the exact location and identity of Raamah and his descendants remain uncertain.
