Jogbehah was a town located in the region of Gilead, east of the Jordan River. According to [[Num.32.35|Numbers 32:35]], it was one of the towns that the tribe of Gad fortified after the conquest of the land. In [[Judg.8.11|Judges 8:11]], Jogbehah is mentioned as being near the route Gideon took when he pursued the Midianite kings Zebah and Zalmunna. Gideon attacked the unsuspecting Midianite camp near Jogbehah and captured the two kings. Its location is unknown.
