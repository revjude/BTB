Juttah was a town located in the hill country of Judah \([[Josh.15.55|Joshua 15:55]]\). It was one of the cities given to the Levites, specifically to the descendants of Aaron, as a place to live \([[Josh.21.16|Joshua 21:16]]\). The town is mentioned only twice in the Bible, and no further information about its history or significance is provided. Its exact location is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the southern part of the hill country of Judah.
