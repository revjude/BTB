The Eshcol Valley is mentioned in the Book of Numbers as the location where the twelve Israelite spies, sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan, obtained a large cluster of grapes \([[Num.13.23|Numbers 13:23]]-24\). The valley was named after Eshcol, an Amorite who was an ally of Abraham \(Genesis 14:13, 24\). 

During the reconnaissance mission, the spies came to the Eshcol Valley and cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes so large that it had to be carried on a pole between two men. They also gathered pomegranates and figs from the area \([[Num.13.23|Numbers 13:23]]\). The bountiful produce of the valley was used as evidence of the land's fertility when the spies reported back to Moses and the Israelites \(Numbers 13:27\). 

However, despite the Eshcol Valley's fruitfulness, the spies' report also emphasized the strength of the Canaanite inhabitants and their fortified cities, which led to fear and rebellion among the Israelites \(Numbers 13:28-33; 14:1-4\). As a result, God condemned the unbelieving generation to wander in the wilderness for forty years \(Numbers 14:26-35\). 

The Eshcol Valley is also mentioned in Deuteronomy 1:24, recounting the spies' journey, and in [[Num.32.9|Numbers 32:9]], where it is referred to as a symbol of the Promised Land's abundance. Its exact location is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the hill country of Judah, near Hebron.
