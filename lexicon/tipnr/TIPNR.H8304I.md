Seraiah, mentioned in [[2Kgs.25.23|2 Kings 25:23]] and [[Jer.40.8|Jeremiah 40:8]], was an officer who served under Gedaliah, the governor appointed by the Babylonians over Judah after the fall of Jerusalem. He was the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, indicating his origin from Netophah, a town in Judah. After the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and exiled many of its inhabitants, they appointed Gedaliah as the governor to oversee the remaining people in the land. Seraiah, along with other officers and their men, came to Gedaliah at Mizpah and pledged their allegiance to him. However, Gedaliah was later assassinated by Ishmael, a member of the royal family, leading to further unrest and instability in the region.
