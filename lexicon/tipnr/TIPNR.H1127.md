Ben-Geber is mentioned in [[1Kgs.4.13|1 Kings 4:13]] as one of the twelve district governors appointed by King Solomon to oversee the provision of food for the king and his household. Each governor was responsible for supplying provisions for one month out of the year. Ben-Geber's district was Ramoth-gilead, which included the towns of Jair son of Manasseh in Gilead, as well as the region of Argob in Bashan, known for its sixty large walled cities with bronze gate bars. The appointment of these twelve governors was part of Solomon's administrative strategy to ensure the smooth running of his kingdom and the well-being of his court. The text does not provide any further details about Ben-Geber's background, family, or personal characteristics. His inclusion in the list of governors highlights the importance of efficient administration and resource management in Solomon's reign, as well as the extent of Solomon's dominion over the surrounding regions.
