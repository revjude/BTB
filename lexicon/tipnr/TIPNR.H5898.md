The City of Salt is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Josh.15.62|Joshua 15:62]], as part of the list of towns in the wilderness of Judah. This wilderness area was located in the eastern part of the territory allocated to the tribe of Judah, near the Dead Sea. 

The exact location of the City of Salt is unknown, but its proximity to the Dead Sea suggests that it may have been involved in the production or trade of salt. The Dead Sea, also known as the Salt Sea, is known for its high salt content, and salt was a valuable commodity in ancient times, used for preserving food and other purposes. 

Apart from its inclusion in the list of towns in the wilderness of Judah, no other information is provided about the City of Salt in the Bible. Its mention in Joshua 15 indicates that it was a recognized settlement during the time of the conquest and division of the Promised Land.
