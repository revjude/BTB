Zeruiah was the sister of King David and the mother of three of his most prominent military leaders: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Her sons played significant roles throughout David's reign, both in military campaigns and in political matters. Joab served as the commander of David's army, while Abishai and Asahel were also known for their bravery and skill in battle. Zeruiah's sons were fiercely loyal to David, though their actions sometimes brought them into conflict with the king. For example, Joab murdered Abner and Amasa, two of David's rivals, without the king's consent. Despite these tensions, David recognized the importance of Zeruiah's sons in establishing and maintaining his kingdom. The fact that Zeruiah is consistently mentioned as their mother highlights her significance in the family and her influence on her sons' roles in David's court.
