- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[1Chr.1.51|Act.6.5]]; 
- only referred to as Timon **<big>[[G5096|Τίμων]]</big>**.

Timon is mentioned in Acts 6:5 as one of the seven men chosen by the apostles to address the needs of Greek-speaking Jewish widows in the early church in Jerusalem. As the church grew, there was a complaint that these widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food. The apostles asked the believers to choose seven men known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom to oversee this task. Timon, along with Stephen, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Parmenas, and Nicolas, was selected and appointed to this role, allowing the apostles to focus on prayer and the ministry of the word.
