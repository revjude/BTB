Shemiramoth was a Levite who lived during the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah. According to [[2Chr.17.8|2 Chronicles 17:8]], he was among the Levites sent by Jehoshaphat to teach the Book of the Law in the cities of Judah. This educational mission was part of Jehoshaphat's reforms to strengthen the spiritual foundation of his kingdom. Shemiramoth, along with other Levites and officials, traveled throughout Judah, instructing the people in the Law of the Lord. This initiative highlighted the importance of religious education and the role of the Levites in preserving and transmitting the knowledge of God's commandments.
