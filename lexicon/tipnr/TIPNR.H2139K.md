Zaccur is mentioned in the list of leaders who accompanied Ezra on his journey from Babylon to Jerusalem after the exile. He, along with Shecaniah, led a group of men from the descendants of Bigvai. The text records that Ezra gathered these leaders and their families at the river that flows to Ahava, where they camped for three days before setting out for Jerusalem. Ezra had called for a fast to seek God's protection for their journey. The inclusion of Zaccur in this list suggests he was a respected leader among the returning exiles.
