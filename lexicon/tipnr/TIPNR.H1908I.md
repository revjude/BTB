Hadad was an Edomite prince who became an adversary to King Solomon of Israel \([[1Kgs.11.14|1 Kings 11:14]]-22\). When King David conquered Edom, Hadad was a young boy. He fled to Egypt with some Edomite servants of his father and found favor with Pharaoh, who gave him a house, land, and provisions. Pharaoh also gave Hadad his sister-in-law, the sister of Queen Tahpenes, as a wife. Hadad and his wife had a son named Genubath, who was raised in Pharaoh's palace. After the deaths of David and Joab, Hadad returned to Edom and became an adversary to Solomon, causing trouble for Israel. The Bible does not provide further details about Hadad's actions against Solomon or the outcome of their conflict.
