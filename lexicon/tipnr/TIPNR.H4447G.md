Hammolecheth is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.7.18|1 Chronicles 7:18]] as the sister of Gilead, who was a descendant of Manasseh, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. She is described as the mother of three individuals: Ishhod, Abiezer, and Mahlah. Abiezer is notable as the clan from which Gideon, one of the judges of Israel, descended \(Judges 6:11, 24\). The name Hammolecheth is unusual, as it is a feminine form of the Hebrew word "melech," meaning "king." Some scholars suggest that this name may indicate a position of authority or leadership held by Hammolecheth within her family or clan. However, no further details about her life or role are provided in the Bible.
