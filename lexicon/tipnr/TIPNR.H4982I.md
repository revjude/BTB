Mattenai was a priest who lived during the time of Joiakim, the high priest who served after the Babylonian exile. In the list of priests and Levites who returned to Jerusalem, Mattenai is mentioned as the head of the priestly family of Joiarib \([[Neh.12.19|Nehemiah 12:19]]\). This suggests that Mattenai was a prominent figure among the priests during this period of Jewish history, as the Israelites sought to reestablish their religious practices and rebuild the temple in Jerusalem.
