- David's compatriot living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Sam.26.6|1Sa.26.6]]; 
- only referred to as Joab **<big>[[H3097|יוֹאָב]]</big>**; 
- his mother was Zeruiah **<big>[[H6870|צְרוּיָה]]</big>**;

Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was King David's nephew and the commander of his army. He first appears in [[1Sam.26.6|1 Samuel 26:6]], accompanying David on a mission to Saul's camp. Joab played a significant role in David's rise to power and the establishment of his kingdom \(2Sa.2-3; 8.16; [[1Chr.11.6|1Ch.11.6]],8\). 

As a military commander, Joab led David's forces in various battles against the Ammonites, Syrians, and other enemies \(2Sa.10; 12.26-27; 1Ch.19\). He also helped quell Absalom's rebellion and was instrumental in defeating Sheba's revolt \(2Sa.18; 20\). 

However, Joab's loyalty to David was sometimes overshadowed by his own ambition and ruthlessness. He killed Abner, Saul's former commander, in revenge for his brother Asahel's death \(2Sa.3\). He also disobeyed David's orders by killing Absalom \(2Sa.18\) and supported Adonijah's attempt to seize the throne \([[1Kgs.1.7|1Ki.1.7]],19\). 

Despite his flaws, Joab remained a key figure in David's reign until the end. He was involved in the census that brought God's judgment upon Israel \(2Sa.24; 1Ch.21\) and was eventually killed by Benaiah on Solomon's orders for his support of Adonijah \(1Ki.2.28-35\).
