Sheba, mentioned in 2 Samuel 20, was a Benjamite who led a rebellion against King David. After the quelling of Absalom's rebellion and David's return to Jerusalem, Sheba took advantage of the lingering tensions between Israel and Judah. He rallied the men of Israel to abandon David, proclaiming, "We have no share in David, no part in Jesse's son!" \([[2Sam.20.1|2 Samuel 20:1]]\). David, recognizing the threat posed by Sheba's rebellion, ordered his men, led by Joab and Abishai, to pursue Sheba. Sheba fled to the city of Abel-beth-maacah, where he sought refuge. Joab besieged the city, but a wise woman intervened and negotiated with him. She convinced the people of the city to behead Sheba and throw his head over the wall to Joab, thus ending the rebellion. The incident with Sheba highlights the fragile unity between Israel and Judah during David's reign and the challenges he faced in maintaining control over the kingdom. It also demonstrates the importance of wise counsel and the role of negotiation in resolving conflicts.
