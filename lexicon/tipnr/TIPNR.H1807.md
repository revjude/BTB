Woman living before Israel's Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Delilah</span> was a Philistine woman who deceived Samson into revealing the secret of his strength, leading to his capture. \([[Judg.16.4|Jdg.16.4]],6,10,12,13,18\)
- A woman living before Israel's Monarchy, first mentioned at [[Judg.16.4|Jdg.16.4]]; 
- only referred to as Delilah **<big>[[H1807|דְּלִילָה]]</big>**; 
- wife of Samson **<big>[[H8123|שִׁמְשׁוֹן]]</big>**.

Delilah, a Philistine woman from the Valley of Sorek, is known for her role in the downfall of Samson, one of Israel's judges. Samson fell in love with Delilah, and the Philistine rulers, seeing an opportunity to defeat their enemy, offered Delilah a substantial sum of money to discover the secret of Samson's strength \([[Judg.16.4|Judges 16:4]]-5\). 

Delilah repeatedly asked Samson to reveal the source of his strength, but he deceived her three times. First, he told her that if he were bound with seven fresh bowstrings, he would become weak, but when she did so, he broke them easily \([[Judg.16.6|Judges 16:6]]-9\). Next, he claimed that new ropes would render him helpless, but he snapped them as well \([[Judg.16.10|Judges 16:10]]-12\). Finally, he said that weaving his hair into a loom would take away his strength, but this too proved false \([[Judg.16.13|Judges 16:13]]-14\). 

Frustrated by Samson's deception, Delilah persistently pressed him for the truth, wearing him down with her words day after day. Eventually, Samson revealed that his strength came from his uncut hair, a sign of his Nazirite vow to God \(Judges 16:15-17\). Delilah lulled Samson to sleep, called for a man to shave his head, and his strength left him \([[Judg.16.18|Judges 16:18]]-19\). 

The Philistines captured the weakened Samson, gouged out his eyes, and forced him to work as a grinder in prison \(Judges 16:20-21\). Delilah's betrayal ultimately led to Samson's humiliation and imprisonment, though he later regained his strength and brought down the Philistine temple, killing many Philistines and himself in the process \(Judges 16:22-30\). 

Delilah's story serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of temptation, deception, and the consequences of betraying one's vows to God. It also highlights the weakness of even the strongest man when he allows himself to be swayed by the wiles of a woman.
