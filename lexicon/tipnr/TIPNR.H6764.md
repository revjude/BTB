Zalaph is mentioned as the father of Hanun, one of the individuals who participated in repairing Jerusalem's wall under Nehemiah's leadership. After the Babylonian exile, Nehemiah led a group of Jews back to Jerusalem to rebuild the city walls and restore the community. Hanun, son of Zalaph, is recorded as having made repairs on another section of the wall, along with Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph. This suggests that Zalaph's family was actively involved in the restoration efforts in Jerusalem.
