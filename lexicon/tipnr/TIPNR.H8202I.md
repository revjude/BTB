Shaphat, mentioned in [[1Chr.3.22|1 Chronicles 3:22]], was a descendant of King David who lived during the postexilic period. He is listed in the genealogical records of David's descendants, specifically in the line of Solomon. Shaphat is identified as one of the sons of Shemaiah, who was a descendant of Zerubbabel, the leader of the first group of exiles who returned to Jerusalem from Babylon. The genealogical record in 1 Chronicles 3 traces the royal line of David, demonstrating the continuity of his dynasty even after the exile. The mention of Shaphat and other descendants of David in this context highlights the importance of preserving the Davidic lineage and the ongoing significance of the Davidic covenant in the postexilic period. However, the text does not provide any specific details about Shaphat's life, his role, or his achievements.
