Man living at the time of the New Testament

Titius <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Justus</span>, a Gentile worshiper of God, hosted Paul in Corinth after he left the synagogue.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Col.4.11|Act.18.7]]; 
- referred to as Justus **<big>[[G2459|Ἰοῦστος]]</big>**, or Titius **<big>[[G6084|Τιτίος]]</big>**.

Titius Justus is mentioned in Acts 18:7 as a Gentile believer who hosted Paul during his ministry in Corinth. The context of the passage is Paul's missionary work in Corinth, where he initially preached in the synagogue but faced opposition from some of the Jews \(Acts 18:1-6\). 

After leaving the synagogue, Paul went to the house of Titius Justus, which was next door to the synagogue \(Acts 18:7\). Titius Justus is described as a worshiper of God, indicating that he was a Gentile who had embraced the Jewish faith and worshiped the God of Israel, although he may not have fully converted to Judaism. 

By hosting Paul in his home, Titius Justus provided a strategic location for the apostle to continue his ministry and reach out to both Jews and Gentiles in Corinth. Paul's presence in Titius Justus' house, right next to the synagogue, may have also served as a powerful statement of the growing Gentile acceptance of the gospel message. 

The fact that Paul chose to stay with Titius Justus highlights the importance of Gentile believers in the early church and their role in supporting and furthering the spread of the gospel. It also demonstrates Paul's willingness to engage with Gentile believers and his commitment to preaching the message of Christ to all people, regardless of their background. 

Apart from this brief mention in the book of Acts, no other information about Titius Justus' life, conversion, or subsequent role in the church is provided in the Bible.
