Jazer was a town located in the region of Gilead, east of the Jordan River. It was conquered by the Israelites during their journey to the Promised Land \([[Num.21.32|Numbers 21:32]]\) and later allotted to the tribe of Gad \([[Num.32.1|Numbers 32:1]],3,35; [[Josh.13.25|Joshua 13:25]]\). The town and its surrounding villages were known for their fertile land, particularly suitable for livestock \([[Num.32.1|Numbers 32:1]]\). Jazer was also designated as a Levitical city \([[Josh.21.39|Joshua 21:39]]; [[1Chr.6.81|1 Chronicles 6:81]]\) and served as a location for the Hebronites, a Levite family, to pasture their flocks \([[1Chr.26.31|1 Chronicles 26:31]]\). The city was famous for its vineyards, which are mentioned in the prophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah \([[Isa.16.8|Isaiah 16:8]],9; Jeremiah 48:32\). During the reign of David, Jazer marked the starting point for the census of Israel \([[2Sam.24.5|2 Samuel 24:5]]\). The exact location of Jazer is uncertain, but it was likely situated near the border between Gilead and Ammon.
