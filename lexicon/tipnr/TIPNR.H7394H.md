- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Kgs.10.15|2Ki.10.15]]; 
- referred to as Rechab **<big>[[H7394|רֵכָב]]</big>**, or Rechabite \(NIV= Rekabite\)  **<big>[[H7397|רֵכָה]]</big>**; 
- a son of Hammath **<big>[[H2575|חַמַּת]]</big>**; 
-  father of Jonadab **<big>[[H3082|יְהוֹנָדָב]]</big>**.

Rechab was the father of Jehonadab \([[2Kgs.10.15|2 Kings 10:15]]\) and the ancestor of the Rechabites, a nomadic tribe known for their strict adherence to God's commands \(Jeremiah 35\). The Rechabites were descendants of the Kenites, who were associated with the Israelites since the time of Moses \(Judges 1:16\). Jehonadab, son of Rechab, supported Jehu in his purge of Baal worship in Israel \([[2Kgs.10.15|2 Kings 10:15]]-23\). The Rechabites were known for their obedience to the commands of their ancestor Jonadab, which included abstaining from wine, not building houses, not sowing seed, and not planting vineyards \([[Jer.35.6|Jeremiah 35:6]]-7\). When the prophet Jeremiah tested their obedience by offering them wine, they refused, demonstrating their commitment to their ancestral vows \(Jeremiah 35:1-11\). God commended the Rechabites for their faithfulness and promised that they would always have a descendant to serve Him \([[Jer.35.18|Jeremiah 35:18]]-19\). The example of the Rechabites stands as a model of obedience and devotion to God in the midst of a society that had largely abandoned His ways.
