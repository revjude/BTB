Zerahiah was a descendant of Pahath-Moab, one of the clans that returned to Jerusalem from Babylonian exile with Ezra. In Ezra 8, which lists the family heads and the number of men who accompanied Ezra, Zerahiah is mentioned as the leader of 200 men of Pahath-Moab. This indicates that he held a position of responsibility and leadership within his clan. The return led by Ezra was significant in the history of Israel, as it marked a renewed commitment to the Law of Moses and the restoration of Jewish worship in Jerusalem. Zerahiah's participation in this journey demonstrates his devotion to God and his support for Ezra's mission.
