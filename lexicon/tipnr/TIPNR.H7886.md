Shiloh is a term that appears in [[Gen.49.10|Genesis 49:10]] as part of Jacob's prophetic blessing on his son Judah. The verse states, "The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes, and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples." The exact meaning of "Shiloh" in this context is debated among scholars. Some interpret it as a reference to a future Messianic figure, a descendant of Judah who would rule over the nations. Others understand it as a place name, possibly referring to the city of Shiloh, where the tabernacle was once set up. In this interpretation, the verse would mean that Judah's leadership would continue until the coming of a time of rest or peace. Regardless of the specific interpretation, the mention of Shiloh in this passage underscores the importance and prominence of the tribe of Judah in the prophetic vision of Israel's future.
