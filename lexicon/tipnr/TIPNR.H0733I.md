Arah is briefly mentioned in [[Neh.6.18|Nehemiah 6:18]] as a Jewish leader whose daughter was married to the son of Tobiah the Ammonite. Tobiah was one of the enemies who opposed Nehemiah's efforts to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem \(Neh. 2:10, 19; 4:3, 7\). The marriage between Arah's daughter and Tobiah's son suggests that some Jewish nobles had formed alliances with foreign adversaries. This connection may have complicated Nehemiah's task of leading the Jewish people and rebuilding Jerusalem.
