- A man living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.21.22|Gen.21.22]]; 
- only referred to as Phicol<[[H6369]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>פ</span>ִּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יכ</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>\).

Phicol was the commander of the army of Abimelech, the Philistine king of Gerar. He is mentioned twice in the book of Genesis, both times in the context of treaties made between Abimelech and the patriarchs. 

In [[Gen.21.22|Genesis 21:22]]-32, Phicol accompanied Abimelech when they approached Abraham to make a treaty, acknowledging that God was with Abraham in all that he did. As part of the treaty, Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs as a witness that he had dug a well, which was named Beersheba. 

Later, in [[Gen.26.26|Genesis 26:26]], Phicol again accompanied Abimelech, along with Ahuzzath, Abimelech's advisor, when they came to make a treaty with Isaac. This event took place after Isaac had reopened the wells dug by his father, Abraham, and had settled in Beersheba. 

Phicol's presence in these narratives suggests that he was a trusted official in Abimelech's court and played a significant role in diplomatic relations with the patriarchs.
