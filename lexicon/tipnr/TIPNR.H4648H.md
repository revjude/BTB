Mephibosheth was a son of King Saul and his concubine Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah \([[2Sam.21.8|2Sa.21.8]]\). He was one of the seven descendants of Saul who were handed over to the Gibeonites to be executed, as a means of atonement for Saul's attempt to annihilate the Gibeonites \([[2Sam.21.8|2Sa.21.8]]\). This event occurred during David's reign, when a three-year famine prompted David to seek the Lord's guidance. The Gibeonites requested seven of Saul's descendants to be handed over to them, and Mephibosheth was among those chosen. He was put to death along with his brothers and the five sons of Merab, Saul's daughter \([[2Sam.21.8|2Sa.21.8]]\).
