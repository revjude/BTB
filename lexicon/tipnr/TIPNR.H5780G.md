Uz was the son of Aram and grandson of Shem, son of Noah. He is mentioned twice in the Table of Nations which records the descendants of Noah's sons who spread out and populated the earth after the flood. Uz was an early post-flood patriarch whose descendants likely settled in the region that bore his name, the land of Uz. This area was probably located east of the Jordan River in what is now northern Saudi Arabia. The Book of Job identifies the land of Uz as Job's homeland. Uz's mention helps trace the Semitic peoples descended from Shem.
