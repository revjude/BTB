- A man living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Sam.23.24|2Sa.23.24]]; 
- only referred to as Dodo **<big>[[H1734|דּוֹדוֹ]]</big>**; 
-  father of Elhanan **<big>[[H0445|אֶלְחָנָן]]</big>**.

Dodo the Bethlehemite is mentioned in the Bible as the father of Elhanan, one of King David's mighty men. Elhanan is listed among David's elite warriors in [[2Sam.23.24|2 Samuel 23:24]] and [[1Chr.11.26|1 Chronicles 11:26]]. 

The fact that Elhanan is identified as the son of Dodo the Bethlehemite indicates that he came from Bethlehem, the same city as David. This connection to David's hometown may have contributed to Elhanan's loyalty and dedication to the king. 

As one of David's mighty men, Elhanan would have been recognized for his exceptional bravery, skill, and military prowess. These warriors were known for their heroic deeds and unwavering support of King David throughout his reign. 

However, beyond mentioning Elhanan as the son of Dodo the Bethlehemite, the Bible does not provide any further information about Dodo himself. His inclusion in the text serves primarily to identify Elhanan and to highlight the fact that he came from Bethlehem. 

It is worth noting that there is another Elhanan mentioned in 2 Samuel 21:19, who is credited with killing Goliath the Gittite. However, this Elhanan is identified as the son of Jaare-oregim, not Dodo, and there is some debate among scholars as to whether this is the same person or a different individual with the same name.
