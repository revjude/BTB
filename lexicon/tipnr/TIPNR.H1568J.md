Gilead is briefly mentioned in [[1Chr.5.14|1 Chronicles 5:14]] as part of the genealogy of the tribe of Gad. He is described as the son of Michael and the father of Jaroah. This genealogy traces the lineage of the Gadites who lived in the land of Bashan, east of the Jordan River, until the time of the Assyrian captivity \(1 Chronicles 5:11-17\). The mention of Gilead in this genealogy helps to establish the family lineage and territorial location of a portion of the tribe of Gad. It is important to note that this Gilead is a different individual from the other Gileads mentioned in the Bible, such as the son of Machir or the father of Jephthah. The name Gilead, which means "heap of witness" or "rocky region," was commonly used both as a personal name and as a geographical designation for the region east of the Jordan River.
