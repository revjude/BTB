Miletus was an ancient city located on the western coast of Asia Minor \(modern-day Turkey\), near the mouth of the Maeander River. It was a significant port city and a center of trade and culture in the Greco-Roman world. 

In the New Testament, Miletus is mentioned in connection with the Apostle Paul's missionary journeys. During his third journey, Paul stopped at Miletus on his way to Jerusalem and sent for the elders of the church in Ephesus to meet him there \(Acts 20:15, 17\). He delivered a farewell address to the Ephesian elders, warning them about false teachers and encouraging them to remain faithful to God \(Acts 20:18-35\). 

In [[2Tim.4.20|2 Timothy 4:20]], Paul mentions that he left Trophimus, one of his companions, ill at Miletus. This statement provides insight into the challenges and hardships faced by early Christian missionaries as they traveled and spread the gospel message. 

Miletus was known for its wool industry and its intellectual and artistic achievements. It was the birthplace of several notable Greek philosophers, including Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes, who were among the first to seek rational explanations for natural phenomena.
