Michael is briefly mentioned in the genealogy of the tribe of Benjamin in the book of 1 Chronicles \([[1Chr.8.16|1Ch.8.16]]\). He is listed as one of the sons of Beriah, along with his brothers: Zebadiah, Arad, Ader, Ishmerai, Izliah, and Jobab. The genealogy traces the descendants of Benjamin, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, and provides insight into the family structure and notable individuals within the tribe. No additional information about Michael's life, occupation, or role within the Benjamite community is provided in the biblical text. His inclusion in the genealogy serves to maintain a record of Benjamin's lineage.
