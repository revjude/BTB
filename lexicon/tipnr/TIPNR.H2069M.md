- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[2Chr.19.11|2Ch.19.11]]; 
- only referred to as Zebadiah **<big>[[H2069|זְבַדְיָה]]</big>**; 
- a son of Ishmael **<big>[[H3458|יִשְׁמָעֵאל]]</big>**.

Zebadiah, the son of Ishmael, held a significant position during the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah. He was appointed as the leader in all matters concerning the king, working alongside Amariah, the chief priest, who oversaw matters related to the Lord. This dual leadership structure suggests a separation of duties between religious and civil affairs. Zebadiah's role likely involved overseeing administrative and judicial matters on behalf of the king. The mention of his father, Ishmael, may indicate that he came from a prominent family. Zebadiah's appointment reflects Jehoshaphat's efforts to establish a well-organized and efficient government.
