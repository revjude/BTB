Magog is mentioned in the Table of Nations \(Gen.10\) and the genealogy of Chronicles \(1Ch.1\) as one of the sons of Japheth, the son of Noah. He is considered the ancestor of a people group that bore his name. In the Bible, the name Magog appears in the prophetic context of Ezekiel 38-39, where Magog is described as a land ruled by Gog, a powerful leader who will lead a coalition of nations against Israel in the end times. The exact identity of the Magog people and their geographical location is uncertain, but some scholars suggest that they may have been associated with the Scythians, a nomadic people who inhabited the region north of the Black Sea. The inclusion of Magog in the Table of Nations and the genealogy of Chronicles emphasizes the biblical understanding of the origins and relationships of the various nations and people groups in the ancient world. As a descendant of Japheth, Magog is part of the lineage that spread out and populated the coastlands and islands, as described in Genesis 10.5.
