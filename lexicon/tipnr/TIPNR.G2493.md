- A prophet living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[Ezra.10.43|Jol.1.1]]; 
- referred to as Joel **<big>[[H3100|יוֹאֵל]]</big>**, or Joel **<big>[[G2493|Ἰωήλ]]</big>**;

Joel, the son of Pethuel, was a prophet of Judah and the author of the Old Testament book that bears his name. Little is known about Joel's personal life or the exact time of his ministry, as the book does not provide specific historical references. However, based on the themes and content of his prophecy, scholars generally place him in the post-exilic period, possibly during the late 5th or early 4th century BC. 

In his prophetic message, Joel describes a devastating locust plague and drought that had struck Judah, using this calamity as a metaphor for the coming Day of the Lord. He calls the people to repentance and promises restoration and blessing for those who turn back to God. Joel's prophecy also includes a powerful vision of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon all people, regardless of age, gender, or social status \(Joel 2:28-32\). 

This prophecy is notably quoted by the apostle Peter in his sermon on the Day of Pentecost \(Acts 2:16-21\), indicating its fulfillment in the early days of the Church. Joel's message, though rooted in the specific challenges faced by Judah in his time, carries a timeless call to repentance, hope in God's mercy, and the promise of the Holy Spirit's transformative power.
