Asahel was the youngest son of Zeruiah, David's sister, and the brother of Joab and Abishai. He was known for his speed and agility, being described as fleet-footed as a wild gazelle. During the battle between the forces of David and Ish-Bosheth at Gibeon, Asahel pursued Abner, the commander of Ish-Bosheth's army. Despite Abner's warnings to turn aside, Asahel refused, and Abner killed him with the butt of his spear. Joab and Abishai later avenged their brother's death by murdering Abner when he came to support David. Asahel was one of David's mighty men and was placed in charge of a division in David's army.
