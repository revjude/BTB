Abidan, the son of Gideoni, was the leader of the tribe of Benjamin during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness after the Exodus from Egypt. He is mentioned several times in the book of Numbers. Abidan was one of the leaders who assisted Moses in taking a census of the Israelite population \([[Num.1.11|Numbers 1:11]]\). He also led the Benjamite tribe when the Israelites camped and marched in the wilderness \([[Num.2.22|Numbers 2:22]]; 10:24\). Additionally, Abidan presented the offering of the tribe of Benjamin during the dedication of the altar in the tabernacle \([[Num.7.60|Numbers 7:60]],65\).
