Zechariah is briefly mentioned in the genealogical record of King Hezekiah of Judah. He is identified as the father of Abijah \(or Abi\), who was the mother of Hezekiah. 

Apart from this genealogical reference, no further information is provided about Zechariah's life or his role in the history of Judah. His inclusion in the genealogy serves to establish the lineage of King Hezekiah and to highlight the importance of family records in the biblical narrative. 

The fact that Zechariah is mentioned by name suggests that he may have been a person of some significance or from a notable family. However, without additional details, it is difficult to make any definitive statements about his life or character. 

The mention of Zechariah in the genealogy of Hezekiah also underscores the interconnectedness of the royal families and the significance of marital alliances in the history of Judah. Hezekiah's mother, Abijah, would have played a crucial role in his upbringing and in shaping his character as a king who sought to restore proper worship and obedience to God in Judah.
