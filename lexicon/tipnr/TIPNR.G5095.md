Timothy was a young disciple and close companion of the Apostle Paul. He is mentioned frequently in the New Testament, both in the book of Acts and in Paul's epistles. Timothy was from Lystra, the son of a Greek father and a Jewish mother named Eunice \(Acts 16:1\). He was well-respected by the believers in his hometown and in Iconium \(Acts 16:2\). Paul invited Timothy to join him on his missionary journeys, and he became a valuable assistant and co-worker \(Acts 16:3; 17:14-15; 18:5; 19:22; 20:4\). Paul referred to Timothy as his "true son in the faith" \([[1Tim.1.2|1 Timothy 1:2]]\) and sent him on important missions to churches in Macedonia, Achaia, and Ephesus \(Acts 19:22; [[1Cor.4.17|1 Corinthians 4:17]]; 16:10; [[Phil.2.19|Philippians 2:19]]\). Timothy was with Paul during his first Roman imprisonment and is named as a co-sender of several of Paul's letters \([[Phil.1.1|Philippians 1:1]]; [[Col.1.1|Colossians 1:1]]; [[Phlm.1.1|Philemon 1:1]]\). Paul also wrote two personal letters to Timothy, providing guidance and encouragement for his pastoral ministry \([[1Tim.1.2|1 Timothy 1:2]]; [[2Tim.1.2|2 Timothy 1:2]]\). These letters, along with the letter to Titus, are known as the Pastoral Epistles. According to [[Heb.13.23|Hebrews 13:23]], Timothy was imprisoned at some point but later released. Tradition holds that Timothy served as the bishop of Ephesus in his later years. Timothy's life and ministry exemplify the importance of mentoring, discipleship, and faithful service in the early church.
