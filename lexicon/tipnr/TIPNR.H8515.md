Telassar is mentioned in [[2Kgs.19.12|2 Kings 19:12]] and [[Isa.37.12|Isaiah 37:12]] as one of the cities conquered by the Assyrians. The context is a message sent by King Sennacherib of Assyria to King Hezekiah of Judah, boasting about the Assyrian victories over various cities and nations. Sennacherib mocks the gods of these conquered lands, including the gods of Telassar, claiming that they were unable to deliver their people from his hand. The exact location of Telassar is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in Mesopotamia, possibly in the region of the Tigris or Euphrates rivers. The name "Telassar" may be derived from the Akkadian language, meaning "mound of Asshur" or "hill of Asshur," referring to the Assyrian deity. The mention of Telassar alongside other conquered cities serves to emphasize the extent of Assyrian power and their disregard for the gods of other nations.
