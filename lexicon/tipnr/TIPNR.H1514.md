Gaham is mentioned briefly in [[Gen.22.24|Genesis 22:24]] as one of the sons born to Nahor, Abraham's brother, and his concubine Reumah. Nahor and Reumah had four sons: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah. This information is provided in the context of the genealogy of Abraham's family, highlighting the relatives of the patriarch. The mention of Nahor's children by his concubine demonstrates the practice of polygamy among the patriarchs and their extended family.
