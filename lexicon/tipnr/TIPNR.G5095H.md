Father of Timothy The father of Timothy, the young disciple and companion of Paul, is mentioned briefly in Acts 16:1. His name is not given, but he is described as a Greek man. Timothy's mother, Eunice, was a Jewish woman who believed in Jesus Christ. This mixed-race background may have contributed to Timothy's ability to relate to both Jewish and Gentile believers in the early church. Although Timothy's father was Greek, it seems that he did not hinder his wife Eunice and mother-in-law Lois from raising Timothy in the Jewish faith and teaching him the Scriptures from childhood \(2 Timothy 1:5; 3:15\).
