Shemaiah was a prophet who lived during the reign of King Rehoboam of Judah. After the kingdom was divided and Jeroboam became king of Israel, Rehoboam gathered his army to fight against Israel and reunite the kingdom. However, the word of God came to Shemaiah, telling him to speak to Rehoboam and the people of Judah and Benjamin, saying that they should not fight against their brothers in Israel because the division was from God \([[1Kgs.12.22|1 Kings 12:22]]-24; [[2Chr.11.2|2 Chronicles 11:2]]-4\). 

Later, when Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem, Shemaiah delivered another message to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah. He told them that because they had forsaken the Lord, He had forsaken them and given them into the hand of Shishak \([[2Chr.12.5|2 Chronicles 12:5]]\). When Rehoboam and the leaders humbled themselves, Shemaiah brought a message of mercy, saying that God would not destroy them but would grant them some deliverance \([[2Chr.12.7|2 Chronicles 12:7]]\). 

Shemaiah's acts and his words as a prophet were recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Judah \([[2Chr.12.15|2 Chronicles 12:15]]\).
