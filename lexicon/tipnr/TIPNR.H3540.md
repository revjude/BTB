Chedorlaomer was the king of Elam, a powerful nation located east of Mesopotamia, during the time of Abraham \([[Gen.14.1|Genesis 14:1]], 4, 5, 9, 17\). He formed a coalition with three other kings: Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, and Tidal king of Goiim. For twelve years, the cities of Sodom, Gomorrah, and others in the region served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year, they rebelled. In response, Chedorlaomer and his allies waged war against the rebellious cities, defeating them and taking captives, including Abraham's nephew Lot. When Abraham learned of Lot's capture, he gathered his 318 trained men and pursued Chedorlaomer's army. With God's help, Abraham defeated Chedorlaomer and his allies, rescuing Lot and recovering the stolen goods. This event showcases Abraham's military prowess and his loyalty to his family, as well as God's faithfulness in granting victory to Abraham and his small force against a powerful coalition of kings.
