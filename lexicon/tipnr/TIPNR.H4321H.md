Micaiah, the son of Gemariah, appears briefly in the book of Jeremiah during the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah \([[Jer.36.11|Jer.36.11]],13\). When Baruch, Jeremiah's scribe, read the prophet's scroll in the temple, Micaiah was present and heard the words of warning and judgment against Judah \(Jer.36.10-11\). Micaiah then went to the royal palace and reported to the officials all that he had heard from the scroll \(Jer.36.12-13\). His report prompted the officials to send for Baruch and have him read the scroll to them \(Jer.36.14\). Micaiah's actions led to the officials' awareness of Jeremiah's prophetic message, although King Jehoiakim ultimately burned the scroll and sought to arrest Jeremiah and Baruch \(Jer.36.20-26\). Micaiah's role in this narrative highlights the importance of bearing witness to God's word and the potential impact of an individual's actions in bringing that word to the attention of those in authority.
