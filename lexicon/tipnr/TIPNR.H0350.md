Ichabod is mentioned in [[1Sam.4.21|1 Samuel 4:21]] and 14:3 as the son of Phinehas and the grandson of Eli, the high priest of Israel. His birth is recorded in the context of a tragic event in Israel's history. 

In 1 Samuel 4, the Israelites were defeated by the Philistines in battle, and the ark of the covenant, a symbol of God's presence, was captured. Upon hearing the news of the ark's capture and the deaths of her husband Phinehas and her father-in-law Eli, Ichabod's mother went into labor and gave birth to him. As she lay dying, she named the child Ichabod, saying, "The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured." 

The name Ichabod means "no glory" or "where is the glory?" reflecting the despair and sense of loss felt by the Israelites at the capture of the ark and the death of the priestly family. The name serves as a reminder of the spiritual and moral decline of Israel during this period. 

In [[1Sam.14.3|1 Samuel 14:3]], Ichabod's brother Ahijah is mentioned as serving as a priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. This suggests that despite the tragic circumstances surrounding Ichabod's birth, the priestly lineage continued through his brother. 

The story of Ichabod's birth highlights the importance of the ark of the covenant in Israelite worship and the devastating consequences of its capture by the Philistines. It also underscores the significance of names in the Bible, as they often reflect the circumstances or character of the individuals who bear them.
