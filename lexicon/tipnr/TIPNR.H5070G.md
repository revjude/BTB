Priest living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Nadab</span>, the eldest son of Aaron, was consumed by fire from the Lord for offering unauthorized incense.
- A priest from the tribe of Levi living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Exod.6.23|Exo.6.23]]; 
- only referred to as Nadab **<big>[[H5070|נָדָב]]</big>**; 
-  son of Aaron **<big>[[H0175|אַהֲרוֹן]]</big>** and Elisheba **<big>[[H0472|אֱלִישֶׁבַע]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Abihu **<big>[[H0030|אֲבִיהוּא]]</big>**, Eleazar **<big>[[H0499|אֶלְעָזָר]]</big>** and Ithamar **<big>[[H0385|אִיתָמָר]]</big>**.

Nadab was the eldest son of Aaron, the first High Priest of Israel, and his wife Elisheba \([[Exod.6.23|Exodus 6:23]]\). Along with his brothers Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, Nadab was consecrated as a priest to serve in the Tabernacle \([[Exod.28.1|Exodus 28:1]]\). 

Nadab, along with his brother Abihu and seventy elders of Israel, accompanied Moses partway up Mount Sinai when the Lord made His covenant with the people \([[Exod.24.1|Exodus 24:1]],9\). There, they saw a manifestation of God's presence and ate and drank in His presence. 

However, Nadab and Abihu later committed a grave offense by offering unauthorized fire \(incense\) before the Lord, which He had not commanded them to do \([[Lev.10.1|Leviticus 10:1]]\). As a result, fire came out from the presence of the Lord and consumed them, and they died before the Lord \(Leviticus 10:2; [[Num.3.4|Numbers 3:4]]; 26:61\). 

This tragic event served as a sobering reminder to the Israelites of the importance of following God's commands precisely, especially in matters related to worship and the priesthood. After their death, Eleazar and Ithamar took over their priestly duties under the direction of their father, Aaron \([[Num.3.4|Numbers 3:4]]; [[1Chr.24.2|1 Chronicles 24:2]]\). 

The story of Nadab and Abihu underscores the holiness of God and the seriousness with which He regards the proper worship and service of His people. It also highlights the importance of obedience and the consequences of disregarding God's clear instructions.
