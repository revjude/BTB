Pelatiah was one of the leaders from the tribe of Simeon who participated in an attack against the Amalekites, according to [[1Chr.4.42|1 Chronicles 4:42]]. Along with his fellow leaders Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, Pelatiah led a group of 500 Simeonites to Mount Seir. There they attacked and destroyed the remnant of the Amalekites who had escaped earlier defeats. This event likely took place after the Babylonian exile, as the Simeonites sought to reclaim their territory. Pelatiah's leadership role suggests he was a capable warrior and commander.
