- A woman living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Phlm.1.24|Act.16.14]]; 
- only referred to as Lydia **<big>[[G3070|Λυδία]]</big>**.

Lydia was a businesswoman from the city of Thyatira who sold purple goods \([[Phlm.1.24|Act.16.14]]\). She was living in Philippi, a Roman colony in Macedonia, when she encountered the apostle Paul and his companions. Lydia is described as a worshiper of God, suggesting that she was a Gentile who followed the Jewish faith. When Paul preached the gospel, the Lord opened her heart to respond to his message \([[Phlm.1.24|Act.16.14]]\). Lydia and her household were baptized, becoming the first recorded converts in Europe \(Act.16.15\). She then invited Paul and his companions to stay at her home, demonstrating her hospitality and eagerness to support the spreading of the gospel \(Act.16.15\). After Paul and Silas were released from prison, they visited Lydia's house and met with the believers before departing from Philippi \(Act.16.40\). Lydia's conversion and her role in hosting the early church in Philippi highlight the importance of women in the early Christian movement and the gospel's appeal to people from various backgrounds.
