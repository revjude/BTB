Bithiah was a daughter of Pharaoh who married Mered, a man from the tribe of Judah \(1 Ch. 4:18\). This marriage is mentioned in the genealogy of Judah, indicating that it was a significant event. The fact that Mered married a daughter of Pharaoh suggests that he may have held a prominent position or had a special connection with Egypt. Such marriages between Israelites and Egyptians were rare, and this union may have taken place during a time of peace and good relations between the two nations. Bithiah's inclusion in the genealogy also highlights the presence of foreign women in the lineage of Judah, demonstrating the complex social and cultural interactions of the Israelites with their neighbors.
