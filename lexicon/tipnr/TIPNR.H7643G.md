Sebam is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the list of towns requested by the tribes of Reuben and Gad as their inheritance east of the Jordan River \(Num. 32:3\). The town was located in the territory allotted to the tribe of Reuben, which was situated in the southern part of the region known as Gilead. The exact location of Sebam is unknown, but it was likely in the vicinity of other towns mentioned in the same list, such as Heshbon and Elealeh. No other information about the town is provided in the Bible, and its history and significance remain obscure. The request for these towns by Reuben and Gad suggests that the region was suitable for livestock and agriculture, which were the primary occupations of these tribes.
