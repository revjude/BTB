Zedekiah, the son of Hananiah, was an official during the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah. He is mentioned in the context of the scroll containing Jeremiah's prophecies, which was read before the king. When the scroll was read in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, Zedekiah was among the officials present, along with Elishama, Delaiah, Elnathan, Gemariah, and others. After hearing the words of the scroll, the officials advised Baruch, Jeremiah's scribe, to hide along with Jeremiah. They then reported the matter to the king.
