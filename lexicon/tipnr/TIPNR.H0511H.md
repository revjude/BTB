Elkanah, an Ephraimite from Ramathaim-zophim, was the father of the prophet Samuel and the husband of Hannah and Peninnah \([[1Sam.1.1|1Sa.1.1]],4\). He was a devout man who regularly went to worship and sacrifice to the Lord at Shiloh \(1Sa.1.3\). Elkanah had two wives, Hannah and Peninnah. While Peninnah had children, Hannah was barren \(1Sa.1.2\). Despite Hannah's inability to bear children, Elkanah loved her deeply and tried to comfort her \([[1Sam.1.8|1Sa.1.8]]\). Hannah prayed fervently for a child and vowed to dedicate him to the Lord's service \([[1Sam.1.1|1Sa.1.1]]1\). After the birth of Samuel, Elkanah supported Hannah in fulfilling her vow and brought the child to serve in the tabernacle under Eli the priest \([[1Sam.1.21|1Sa.1.21]]-28\). Elkanah continued to worship at Shiloh and received a blessing from Eli for his devotion \([[1Sam.2.20|1Sa.2.20]]\). He is also mentioned in the genealogies of the Levites as an ancestor of Samuel and his sons \([[1Chr.6.27|1Ch.6.27]],34\). Elkanah's story highlights his faithfulness, love for his family, and support for Hannah's dedication of Samuel to the Lord's service.
