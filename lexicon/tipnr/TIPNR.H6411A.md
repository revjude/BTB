- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Neh.8.7|Neh.8.7]]; 
- only referred to as Pelaiah<[[H6411A]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>פ</span>ְּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>אי</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>\).

Pelaiah was a Levite who played a role in the religious reforms of Ezra and Nehemiah. In [[Neh.8.7|Nehemiah 8:7]], he is listed among the Levites who helped the people understand the Law as Ezra read it. They explained the meaning of the readings, suggesting that Pelaiah had knowledge and teaching skills. Later, in [[Neh.10.10|Nehemiah 10:10]], Pelaiah is among the Levites who signed the covenant Nehemiah established. This covenant committed the people to follow God's Law and support the temple. Pelaiah's involvement in both teaching and signing the covenant indicates he was an active participant in the spiritual renewal of the post-exilic community.
