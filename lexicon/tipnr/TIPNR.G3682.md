Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Onesimus</span> was a runaway slave who became a Christian through Paul's ministry and was the subject of Paul's letter to Philemon.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Col.4.9|Col.4.9]]; 
- referred to as Onesimus or \[ \] \(KJV= Onesimus\)  **<big>[[G3682|Ὀνήσιμος]]</big>**.

Onesimus was a slave who belonged to Philemon, a Christian from Colossae \([[Col.4.9|Colossians 4:9]]\). He ran away from his master and, in some way, came into contact with the apostle Paul while Paul was in prison \([[Phlm.1.10|Philemon 1:10]]\). Through Paul's ministry, Onesimus became a Christian and proved to be a valuable companion and helper to Paul \(Philemon 1:11-13\). Paul sent Onesimus back to Philemon with a personal letter, urging Philemon to receive Onesimus back, not as a slave, but as a beloved brother in Christ \(Philemon 1:16-17\). Paul also offered to pay any debt that Onesimus might owe to Philemon \(Philemon 1:18-19\). The letter to Philemon is a powerful example of Christian love, forgiveness, and the transforming power of the gospel in human relationships. Onesimus is also mentioned as a faithful and beloved brother in Paul's letter to the Colossians \([[Col.4.9|Colossians 4:9]]\).
