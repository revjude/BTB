Shen is mentioned briefly in the account of Samuel's leadership over Israel \(1 Sam. 7:12\). After the Israelites repented of their idolatry and turned back to the Lord, Samuel led them in a decisive victory over the Philistines. To commemorate this victory and God's help, Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen, naming it Ebenezer, which means "stone of help." The exact location of Shen is not specified in the biblical text, but it was likely a place near Mizpah, in the territory of Benjamin. The setting up of the Ebenezer stone at Shen served as a reminder of God's deliverance and the importance of relying on His strength in the face of enemy threats. This event marked a significant moment in Israel's history, as it demonstrated the nation's renewed commitment to the Lord and His faithfulness in granting them victory over their oppressors.
