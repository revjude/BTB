Jamin was one of the sons of Simeon, the second son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and Leah, as recorded in [[Gen.46.10|Genesis 46:10]], [[Exod.6.15|Exodus 6:15]], and [[1Chr.4.24|1 Chronicles 4:24]]. He was born in Canaan and went down to Egypt with his father and grandfather as part of the seventy members of Jacob's household \(Genesis 46:27\). In [[Num.26.12|Numbers 26:12]], Jamin is mentioned as one of the clans of Simeon, suggesting that his descendants formed a significant subgroup within the tribe. The Bible does not provide any further details about Jamin's life or his role in the events of the Israelites' history.
