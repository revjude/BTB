Zereth-shahar was a city allotted to the tribe of Reuben as part of the distribution of land east of the Jordan River \([[Josh.13.19|Jos.13.19]]\). It is described as being on a mountain in the plain, likely referring to the tableland east of the Dead Sea. The name Zereth-shahar means "splendor of dawn," though the significance of the name is uncertain. No further details are given about the city's history or importance. Its exact location is unknown but was likely somewhere near the northeastern shore of the Dead Sea within the territory of Reuben.
