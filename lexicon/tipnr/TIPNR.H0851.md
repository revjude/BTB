Eshtemoa, also known as Eshtemoh, was a city located in the hill country of Judah \([[Josh.15.50|Joshua 15:50]]\). It was allotted to the Levites, specifically to the descendants of Aaron, as one of their cities \([[Josh.21.14|Joshua 21:14]]; [[1Chr.6.57|1 Chronicles 6:57]]\). 

Several individuals are associated with Eshtemoa in the genealogies of Judah. In [[1Chr.4.17|1 Chronicles 4:17]], Ishbah is mentioned as the father of Eshtemoa. Later, in [[1Chr.4.19|1 Chronicles 4:19]], the sons of Ezrah are listed, including Eshtemoa. 

During the time of David, when he was hiding from King Saul in the wilderness of Judah, David sent some of the spoils from his victory over the Amalekites to the elders of Eshtemoa, among other cities \([[1Sam.30.28|1 Samuel 30:28]]\). This act of sharing the spoils was likely a gesture of goodwill and a way to strengthen alliances with the cities that had supported him. 

The exact location of Eshtemoa is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the southern part of the hill country of Judah, possibly near the modern-day village of es-Semu'a, about 15 kilometers south of Hebron. As a Levitical city, Eshtemoa would have played a role in the religious life of the surrounding region, with the Levites serving as teachers, judges, and spiritual leaders.
