Hamutal was the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah and the mother of two kings of Judah: Jehoahaz and Zedekiah \([[2Kgs.23.31|2 Kings 23:31]]; 24:18\). Jehoahaz, also known as Shallum, became king after the death of his father, King Josiah \(1 Chronicles 3:15\). However, he reigned for only three months before being deposed by Pharaoh Necho of Egypt \([[2Kgs.23.31|2 Kings 23:31]]-34\). Zedekiah, Hamutal's other son, was the last king of Judah before the Babylonian exile. He was appointed as king by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, after the deportation of his nephew, King Jehoiachin \(2 Kings 24:17-18\). Zedekiah reigned for eleven years but ultimately rebelled against Babylon, leading to the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple \(2 Kings 25:1-10\). The mention of Hamutal in the genealogies of the kings of Judah highlights the importance of maternal lineage in the royal succession and provides insight into the political dynamics of the time.
