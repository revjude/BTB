Aenon is mentioned in [[John.3.23|John 3:23]] as a place where John the Baptist was baptizing people because there was plenty of water there. It is described as being near Salim, which suggests that both locations were in the same general area. The exact location of Aenon is uncertain, but scholars have proposed several possible sites in the Jordan Valley, such as Wadi Farah \(a perennial stream\) or 'Ain Farah \(a spring\) near the Jordan River. 

The name Aenon is derived from the Greek word "aenon," meaning "springs" or "fountains," indicating that the site had a plentiful water supply, which was necessary for John's baptismal ministry. The mention of Aenon in the context of John's ministry highlights the importance of baptism and the need for adequate water resources to perform this ritual. Some scholars also see the reference to Aenon as an indication of John's growing influence and the expanding scope of his ministry beyond the immediate region of the Jordan River.
