Beeroth, also known as Beer, was a city originally inhabited by the Hivites, one of the Canaanite tribes. During the Israelite conquest of Canaan, the people of Beeroth, along with those of Gibeon, Chephirah, and Kiriath-jearim, deceived Joshua and the Israelites into making a peace treaty with them by pretending to be from a distant land \([[Josh.9.17|Joshua 9:17]]\). 

After the treaty was made, Beeroth was allotted to the tribe of Benjamin as part of their inheritance in the Promised Land \([[Josh.18.25|Joshua 18:25]]\). The city was located in the region north of Jerusalem, near Gibeon and Kiriath-jearim. 

Beeroth is mentioned in connection with several events in the Bible. It was the hometown of two of David's mighty men, Naharai \([[2Sam.23.37|2 Samuel 23:37]]; [[1Chr.11.39|1 Chronicles 11:39]]\) and Rechab and Baanah, who murdered Ish-bosheth, Saul's son \([[2Sam.4.2|2 Samuel 4:2]]-3, 5, 9\). After the Babylonian exile, some of the people of Beeroth returned to Judah \([[Ezra.2.25|Ezra 2:25]]; [[Neh.7.29|Nehemiah 7:29]]\). 

In [[Judg.9.21|Judges 9:21]], Jotham, the youngest son of Gideon, fled to Beer \(possibly another name for Beeroth\) for safety after confronting the people of Shechem about their support for his half-brother Abimelech, who had killed Jotham's brothers. 

The city of Beeroth played a role in the early history of Israel, first as a Canaanite city that deceived the Israelites, then as part of the tribe of Benjamin's inheritance, and later as the hometown of some of David's mighty men and a place of refuge for Jotham.
