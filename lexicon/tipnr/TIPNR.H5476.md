Sodi is mentioned in [[Num.13.10|Numbers 13:10]] as the father of Gaddiel, who was the representative from the tribe of Zebulun among the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan. After the Israelites had left Egypt and were nearing the Promised Land, Moses selected one man from each of the twelve tribes to scout out the land and bring back a report \(Numbers 13:1-2\). Gaddiel, son of Sodi, was chosen from the tribe of Zebulun. The spies were instructed to assess the land, its people, and its cities, and to bring back some of the fruit of the land \(Numbers 13:17-20\). After forty days, the spies returned with their report, but only Joshua and Caleb gave a positive assessment, while the other ten spies, including Gaddiel, discouraged the people by emphasizing the strength of the inhabitants \(Numbers 13:25-33\). As a result, the Israelites rebelled against God and were condemned to wander in the wilderness for forty years \(Numbers 14:26-35\).
