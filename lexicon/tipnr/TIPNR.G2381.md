<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Thomas</span>, also called Didymus, was one of Jesus' twelve disciples, known for doubting Jesus' resurrection until he saw him in person.
- An apostle living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Matt.10.3|Mat.10.3]]; 
- referred to as Thomas or \[ \] \(KJV= Thomas\)  **<big>[[G2381|Θωμᾶς]]</big>**, or Twin \(KJV= Didymus\)  **<big>[[G1324|Δίδυμος]]</big>**.

Thomas, also known as Didymus \(meaning "twin"\), was one of the twelve disciples of Jesus Christ. He is mentioned in all four Gospels and the Book of Acts \([[Matt.10.3|Matthew 10:3]]; [[Mark.3.18|Mark 3:18]]; [[Luke.6.15|Luke 6:15]]; [[John.11.16|John 11:16]]; 14:5; 20:24-29; 21:2; Acts 1:13\). Thomas is best known for his doubt about Jesus' resurrection, earning him the nickname "Doubting Thomas." When Jesus appeared to the disciples after his resurrection, Thomas was absent and refused to believe unless he could see and touch Jesus' wounds \([[John.20.24|John 20:24]]-25\). A week later, Jesus appeared again, inviting Thomas to touch his wounds. Thomas then confessed, "My Lord and my God!" \([[John.20.26|John 20:26]]-28\). Jesus praised those who believe without seeing \([[John.20.29|John 20:29]]\). Thomas also showed devotion to Jesus, willing to die with him \([[John.11.16|John 11:16]]\) and asking questions during the Last Supper \([[John.14.5|John 14:5]]\). According to tradition, Thomas later preached the gospel in India, where he was martyred. His initial doubt and later confession serve as an encouragement for believers who struggle with doubts.
