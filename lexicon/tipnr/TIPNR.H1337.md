Bath-rabbim, meaning "daughter of many," is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Song of Solomon 7:4. In this verse, the Beloved's eyes are compared to the pools of Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Heshbon was the capital city of Sihon, king of the Amorites, which was later allotted to the tribe of Reuben \(Numbers 21:26; Joshua 13:17\). 

The gate of Bath-rabbim was likely one of the main gates of Heshbon, possibly named for its location near a busy area or a place where many people gathered. The pools of Heshbon mentioned in the verse were probably nearby reservoirs or water sources. 

In the Song of Solomon, the comparison of the Beloved's eyes to these pools suggests that they were clear, peaceful, and beautiful. The gate of Bath-rabbim serves as a poetic reference to emphasize the beauty and serenity of the Beloved's eyes.
