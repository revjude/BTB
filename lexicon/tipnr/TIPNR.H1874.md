- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.56|Ezr.2.56]];

Darkon is mentioned in [[Ezra.2.56|Ezra 2:56]] and [[Neh.7.58|Nehemiah 7:58]] as the ancestor of a family of temple servants \(Nethinim\) who returned to Jerusalem from the Babylonian exile. The Nethinim were a group of people assigned to assist the Levites in the maintenance and service of the Temple. 

In both passages, the descendants of Darkon are listed among the Nethinim who returned to Jerusalem under the leadership of Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, and Jeshua, the high priest. This return took place around 538 BC, after the Persian king Cyrus issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to their homeland and rebuild the Temple. 

The mention of Darkon's family in these lists highlights the importance of the Nethinim in the restoration of Temple worship after the exile. Although they were not Levites, they played a vital role in supporting the Temple's functions and were considered part of the Jewish community. 

Apart from being named as the ancestor of a family of temple servants, no other information about Darkon himself is provided in the Bible.
