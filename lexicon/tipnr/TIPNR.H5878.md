Harod, also known as the Spring of Harod or the Well of Harod, was a significant water source mentioned in the Bible, particularly in the story of Gideon. In [[Judg.7.1|Judges 7:1]], it is recorded that Gideon and his army camped beside the spring of Harod, while the Midianites were north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh. It was at this location that God instructed Gideon to reduce his army from 32,000 men to a mere 300, based on how they drank water from the spring \(Judges 7:4-7\). This event demonstrated God's power to deliver Israel from their enemies, even with a small force. The exact location of the Spring of Harod is not certain, but it is believed to be in the Jezreel Valley, near the ancient city of Jezreel. The spring is also mentioned in connection with two of David's mighty men, Shammah the Harodite \(2 Samuel 23:25\) and Elika the Harodite \([[1Chr.11.27|1 Chronicles 11:27]]\), indicating that it may have been a place of origin or residence for some of David's warriors. The Spring of Harod played a crucial role in Gideon's victory over the Midianites and serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and power to deliver His people.
