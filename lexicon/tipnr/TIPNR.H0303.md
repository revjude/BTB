Ahlab, also known as Mahalab, was a Canaanite city that was allotted to the tribe of Asher during the division of the Promised Land \([[Josh.19.29|Joshua 19:29]]\). It was located in the western part of Galilee, near the Mediterranean coast. However, the tribe of Asher failed to drive out the Canaanite inhabitants of Ahlab, and as a result, the Canaanites continued to live among them \([[Judg.1.31|Judges 1:31]]\). 

This failure to completely conquer and possess the allotted territory was a common problem for several Israelite tribes during the period of the judges. The continued presence of Canaanites in cities like Ahlab would have exposed the Israelites to the influence of pagan religions and practices, which ultimately led to spiritual decline and disobedience to God. The exact location of Ahlab is uncertain, but it is generally associated with the site of Khirbet el-Mahalib, about 4 miles \(6.4 km\) northeast of Tyre.
