- An apostle living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Matt.10.3|Mat.10.3]]; 
- only referred to as James<[[G2385H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ἰάκωβος</span>\); 
- a son of Alphaeus<[[G0256]]>.

James is mentioned in the New Testament as the father of Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve Apostles. In the lists of the apostles provided in [[Matt.10.3|Matthew 10:3]], [[Mark.3.18|Mark 3:18]], [[Luke.6.15|Luke 6:15]]-16, and Acts 1:13, Judas is consistently identified as "Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon." However, in John 6:71 and 13:26, he is called "Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot." This suggests that "Iscariot" may have been a family name or a reference to their place of origin, possibly the town of Kerioth in Judea. Apart from being the father of Judas, no other information is provided about James' life, occupation, or role in the events surrounding Jesus' ministry and his son's betrayal.
