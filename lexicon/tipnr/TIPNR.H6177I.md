Aroer is mentioned in [[1Sam.30.28|1 Samuel 30:28]] as one of the cities in Judah that received a share of the spoils from David's victory over the Amalekites. This Aroer is distinct from the cities of the same name located in the Transjordan region. 

After David and his men defeated the Amalekites, who had raided and burned Ziklag, they recovered all the captives and plunder \(1 Samuel 30:18-20\). David sent portions of the spoils to the elders of Judah and to his friends in various cities, including Aroer \(1 Samuel 30:26-31\). 

The exact location of this Aroer in Judah is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the southern part of the tribe's territory. David's act of sharing the spoils with Aroer and other cities demonstrates his desire to strengthen his relationship with the people of Judah and to show gratitude for their support. 

Apart from this single reference in the context of David's distribution of the Amalekite spoils, no other information about this specific Aroer is provided in the Bible. Its mention highlights David's strategic and diplomatic efforts to consolidate his position as the future king of Israel.
