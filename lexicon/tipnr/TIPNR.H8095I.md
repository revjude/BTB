A wife of Simeon, the son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\), is mentioned in [[Gen.46.10|Genesis 46:10]] as part of the genealogy of Jacob's family. The passage lists the descendants of Jacob who came with him to Egypt during the time of Joseph. Simeon, one of Jacob's twelve sons, is mentioned along with his sons Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul. The text also notes that Shaul was the son of a Canaanite woman, implying that Simeon had married a Canaanite wife. No further details about Simeon's wife are provided in the biblical text, and she remains unnamed. The mention of Simeon's wife in the genealogy serves to provide a complete record of Jacob's family and their descendants, highlighting the growth of the Israelite people even before their settlement in Egypt.
