Eliezer was a prophet who rebuked King Jehoshaphat of Judah for his alliance with King Ahaziah of Israel \([[2Chr.20.37|2Ch.20.37]]\). Jehoshaphat had joined forces with Ahaziah to build ships to go to Tarshish, but Eliezer prophesied against this alliance, declaring that God had destroyed Jehoshaphat's works because of his partnership with Ahaziah. As a result, the ships were wrecked and never set sail to Tarshish. The Bible does not provide any further details about Eliezer or his prophetic ministry.
