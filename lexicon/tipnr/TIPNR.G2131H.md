Father of Eunice The father of Eunice, mentioned in [[2Tim.1.5|2 Timothy 1:5]], is not named in the biblical text. He was the maternal grandfather of Timothy, Paul's young disciple and companion. Eunice, along with her mother Lois, was commended by Paul for her sincere faith, which they had passed on to Timothy. Although no further information is provided about Eunice's father, his legacy of faith appears to have had a significant impact on his daughter and grandson, who both became followers of Christ and influential members of the early church.
