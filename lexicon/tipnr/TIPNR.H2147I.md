Zichri was another Benjamite mentioned in the genealogy of Shaharaim's descendants in 1 Chronicles 8. He was the son of Jeroham and is listed among the heads of families living in Jerusalem. This suggests that some Benjamites had settled in the capital city, possibly after the establishment of the monarchy under King David. The inclusion of Zichri in this genealogical record helps to trace the lineage and geographic distribution of the tribe of Benjamin.
