Priscilla, also referred to as Prisca, was a prominent Jewish Christian woman in the early church. She is consistently mentioned alongside her husband, Aquila, suggesting that they worked together as a team in ministry. Priscilla and Aquila were originally from Rome but had been forced to leave due to the emperor Claudius' edict expelling the Jews \(Acts 18:2\). They settled in Corinth, where they met the apostle Paul and worked with him as tentmakers \(Acts 18:3\). When Paul left Corinth, Priscilla and Aquila accompanied him to Ephesus \(Acts 18:18\). In Ephesus, they encountered Apollos, a learned Jewish Christian, and instructed him more accurately in the way of God \(Acts 18:26\). This event highlights Priscilla's knowledge of the Scriptures and her active role in teaching and discipleship. Priscilla and Aquila also hosted a church in their home, both in Ephesus \([[1Cor.16.19|1 Corinthians 16:19]]\) and later in Rome \([[Rom.16.3|Romans 16:3]]-5\). Paul's warm greetings to the couple in his letters testify to their close friendship and partnership in the gospel ministry \([[Rom.16.3|Romans 16:3]]-4; [[2Tim.4.19|2 Timothy 4:19]]\). Priscilla's example demonstrates the significant contributions of women in the early spread of Christianity and their active roles in the life of the church.
