Lamech was a descendant of Cain, the son of Adam and Eve \([[Gen.4.18|Gen.4.18]]\). He was the father of Jabal, Jubal, and Tubal-cain \(Gen.4.20-22\). Lamech is notable for being the first polygamist mentioned in the Bible, having married two women, Adah and Zillah \([[Gen.4.19|Gen.4.19]]\). He is also known for his speech to his wives, in which he boasted about killing a man for wounding him and claimed that he would be avenged seventy-sevenfold, in contrast to the sevenfold vengeance promised to Cain \(Gen.4.23-24\). This speech suggests a progression of violence and a disregard for the sanctity of human life among Cain's descendants.
