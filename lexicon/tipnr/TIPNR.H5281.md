- A woman living before Israel's Monarchy, first mentioned at [[Luke.3.25|Rut.1.2]]; 
- referred to as Naomi **<big>[[H5281|נׇעֳמִי]]</big>**, or Mara **<big>[[H4755|מָרָא]]</big>**; 
- wife of Elimelech **<big>[[H0458|אֱלִימֶלֶךְ]]</big>**;

Naomi, later known as Mara, was an Israelite woman from Bethlehem who played a significant role in the Book of Ruth. She was the wife of Elimelech and the mother of Mahlon and Chilion. 

During a time of famine, Naomi and her family moved to the land of Moab. While there, her sons married Moabite women, Ruth and Orpah. Tragically, Elimelech and both of Naomi's sons died, leaving her widowed and childless \(Ruth 1:1-5\). 

Hearing that the famine in Israel had ended, Naomi decided to return to Bethlehem. She encouraged her daughters-in-law to remain in Moab, but Ruth insisted on accompanying her \(Ruth 1:6-18\). Upon their arrival in Bethlehem, Naomi expressed her bitterness, saying, "Call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me" \(Ruth 1:20\). The name "Mara" means "bitter" in Hebrew. 

Naomi played a crucial role in guiding Ruth and helping her find security and provision. She instructed Ruth to glean in the fields of Boaz, a relative of Elimelech \(Ruth 2:1-3\). Later, Naomi encouraged Ruth to seek marriage with Boaz as a kinsman-redeemer, following Israelite custom \(Ruth 3:1-4\). 

Through Boaz and Ruth's marriage, Naomi's lineage was preserved. When their son Obed was born, the women of Bethlehem declared to Naomi, "Blessed be the Lord, who has not left you this day without a redeemer" \(Ruth 4:14\). Obed became the grandfather of King David, making Naomi an ancestor of both David and, ultimately, Jesus Christ. 

Naomi's story is one of loss, faithfulness, and redemption. Her journey from bitterness to joy, through the love and loyalty of Ruth and the providence of God, has made her an enduring example of faith and resilience.
