The Forum of Appius, also known as Appii Forum, is mentioned in Acts 28:15 as one of the places where Christians from Rome came to meet the apostle Paul as he was being brought to the city as a prisoner. The Forum of Appius was a market town located along the Appian Way, the main road connecting Rome to southern Italy. 

According to the narrative in Acts, after Paul had appealed to Caesar and was sent to Rome, he was permitted to stay by himself with a soldier guarding him \(Acts 28:16\). As Paul approached the city, believers from Rome traveled to meet him at two locations: the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns \(Acts 28:15\). 

The Forum of Appius was situated about 43 miles \(69 kilometers\) southeast of Rome and was a popular stopping point for travelers. It was named after Appius Claudius Caecus, the Roman censor who initiated the construction of the Appian Way in 312 BC. The town likely served as a marketplace and resting place for those journeying along the road. 

The fact that Christians from Rome came to meet Paul at the Forum of Appius demonstrates the strong support and eagerness of the Roman believers to welcome and encourage the apostle. This meeting would have provided Paul with much-needed fellowship and reassurance as he faced the challenges of his impending trial before Caesar. 

The mention of the Forum of Appius in the biblical account of Paul's journey to Rome provides insight into the spread of Christianity and the connections between believers in different parts of the Roman Empire. It also highlights the importance of the Appian Way as a major transportation route and the role of market towns like the Forum of Appius in facilitating travel and communication in the ancient world.
