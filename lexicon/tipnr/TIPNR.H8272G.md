Sharezer, mentioned in [[2Kgs.19.37|2 Kings 19:37]] and [[Isa.37.38|Isaiah 37:38]], was one of the sons of Sennacherib, the king of Assyria. Along with his brother Adrammelech, Sharezer plotted against their father and assassinated him while he was worshiping in the temple of his god, Nisroch. After committing the murder, Sharezer and Adrammelech fled to the land of Ararat, which was located in modern-day Armenia. The assassination of Sennacherib occurred shortly after his campaign against Jerusalem during the reign of King Hezekiah. The text does not provide any further details about Sharezer's life or his motivations for the assassination. However, the incident highlights the political instability and power struggles within the Assyrian royal family. The fact that Sharezer and his brother fled to Ararat suggests that they feared retribution or lacked support within Assyria. The assassination of Sennacherib marked the end of his reign and was a significant event in the history of Assyria and its relations with the kingdom of Judah.
