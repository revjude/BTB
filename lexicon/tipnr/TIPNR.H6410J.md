- a son of Benaiah<[[H1141R]]>.

Pelatiah son of Benaiah was one of the twenty-five princes of Israel whom the prophet Ezekiel saw in a vision, according to [[Ezek.11.1|Ezekiel 11:1]]. These princes were described as wicked men who gave evil advice in the city. As Ezekiel was prophesying, he saw Pelatiah die, causing him to fall on his face and cry out to God, asking if He would destroy the remnant of Israel \([[Ezek.11.1|Ezekiel 11:1]]3\). Pelatiah's death in the vision served as a sign of the judgment that would come upon the leaders who had led the people astray. The vision emphasizes the responsibility of leaders and the consequences of their actions.
