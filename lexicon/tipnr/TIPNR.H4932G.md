The Second Quarter is mentioned in the Bible as a district or section of Jerusalem. It is first referenced in connection with the prophetess Huldah, who lived in the Second Quarter of Jerusalem during the reign of King Josiah \(2 Ki. 22:14; 2 Chr. 34:22\). When the book of the Law was found in the temple, Josiah sent messengers to consult Huldah, who then prophesied about the impending judgment on Judah and Jerusalem. 

The Second Quarter is also mentioned in the prophecy of Zephaniah, where it is listed among the places in Jerusalem that would experience distress and destruction \(Zeph. 1:10\). This suggests that the Second Quarter was a significant residential area within the city. 

The exact location and boundaries of the Second Quarter are not specified in the Bible. However, its mention in both historical and prophetic texts indicates that it was a recognized district in Jerusalem during the time of the Judean monarchy.
