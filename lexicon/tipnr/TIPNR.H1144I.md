This Benjamin was an Israelite who had married a foreign woman during the time of Ezra. As part of Ezra's reforms to purify the Jewish community and restore obedience to God's law, those who had married foreign wives were required to divorce them \(Ezr. 10:32\). Benjamin was among those who complied with this directive, demonstrating his willingness to prioritize his faith and obedience to God over his personal relationships. This act of separation from foreign influences was seen as necessary to preserve the religious and cultural identity of the Jewish people.
