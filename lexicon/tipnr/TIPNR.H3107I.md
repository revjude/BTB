- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.12.20a|1Ch.12.20a]]; 
- only referred to as Jozabad **<big>[[H3107|יוֹזָבָד]]</big>**.

Jozabad is one of two men of that name  in 1 Chronicles 12:20 who were leaders from the tribe of Manasseh who joined David at Ziklag. The context of the passage is the listing of the warriors who allied themselves with David during his time of exile and conflict with King Saul \(1 Chronicles 12:1-22\). 

When David was returning to Ziklag, after being dismissed by the Philistine commanders who were suspicious of his loyalty, several Manassite leaders deserted Saul's army and joined David \(1 Chronicles 12:19-20\). Jozabad is named among these leaders, along with Adnah, Michael, Jediael, Elihu, and Zillethai \(1 Chronicles 12:20\). 

These Manassite leaders were described as mighty men of valor and commanders in the army \(1 Chronicles 12:21\). They provided significant military support to David, helping him in his raids against the Geshurites, Girzites, and Amalekites, who had attacked and plundered Ziklag \(1 Chronicles 12:21; 1 Samuel 30:1-20\).
