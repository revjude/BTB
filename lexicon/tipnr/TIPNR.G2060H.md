- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at Rom.16.14; 
- referred to as Hermes or Hermas \(=Var, KJV\)  **<big>[[G2060|Ἑρμῆς]]</big>**.

Hermes is mentioned in the Bible as one of the Christians in Rome to whom Paul sent greetings in his letter to the Romans. He is listed along with several other believers, including Asyncritus, Phlegon, and Hermas \(Rom.16.14\). The fact that Paul specifically mentions Hermes in his greetings suggests that he was a notable member of the Roman Christian community. However, no further information is provided about Hermes' background, conversion, or role in the church. The name Hermes was common in the Greco-Roman world, and it is not clear whether this Hermes had any connection to the Greek god of the same name. \(Rom.16.14\).
