Ahikam was the son of Shaphan the scribe and an important official during the reigns of King Josiah and King Jehoiakim of Judah. He first appears in the biblical narrative when Josiah sends him, along with other officials, to consult the prophetess Huldah regarding the book of the Law discovered in the temple. \([[2Kgs.22.12|2Ki.22.12]]-14; [[2Chr.34.20|2Ch.34.20]]\) 

Later, during the reign of Jehoiakim, Ahikam uses his influence to protect the prophet Jeremiah from being put to death when Jeremiah's prophecies anger the officials and the people. \([[Jer.26.24|Jer.26.24]]\). 

After the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians, the Babylonian captain of the guard appoints Gedaliah, Ahikam's son, as governor over the cities of Judah. \([[2Kgs.25.22|2Ki.25.22]]\) Jeremiah is released from captivity and entrusted to Gedaliah's care. \([[Jer.39.14|Jer.39.14]]; 40.5-6\) 

Gedaliah establishes his headquarters at Mizpah and encourages the remaining people in Judah to serve the Babylonians. \([[Jer.40.7|Jer.40.7]]-12\) However, Ishmael, a member of the royal family, murders Gedaliah and those with him, causing the people to flee to Egypt out of fear of Babylonian reprisal. \([[Jer.41.1|Jer.41.1]]-18\) Ahikam's role in protecting Jeremiah and his son's appointment as governor highlight the family's importance during this turbulent period in Judah's history.
