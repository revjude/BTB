Jedidah's son, Josiah, became king at the age of eight and reigned for thirty-one years in Jerusalem. He is known for his religious reforms and his efforts to restore the worship of the Lord in Judah. The text does not provide any further information about Jedidah's life or her role in Josiah's upbringing. However, her mention as the mother of a significant king in Judah's history highlights the importance of maternal lineage in the royal succession.
