Immer is mentioned in the lists of people who returned to Jerusalem from the Babylonian exile \([[Ezra.2.59|Ezra 2:59]]; [[Neh.7.61|Nehemiah 7:61]]\). The context suggests that it was a place from which some of the returning exiles originated. However, these people could not prove their ancestry or that they belonged to Israel.
