The forest of Hereth was a place where David sought refuge when he was fleeing from King Saul \(1 Sam 22:5\). After leaving the cave of Adullam, David went to Mizpeh of Moab, seeking protection for his parents. The prophet Gad then instructed David to leave Mizpeh and go to the land of Judah. David obeyed and came to the forest of Hereth. The exact location of this forest is unknown, but it was likely situated in the hill country of Judah, providing a suitable hideout for David and his men as they evaded Saul's pursuit.
