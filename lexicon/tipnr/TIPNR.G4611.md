Shelah, also known as Shiloah, the King's Pool, or Siloam, was a pool located in the southeastern part of Jerusalem, near the City of David. It was fed by the waters of the Gihon Spring, which were diverted through Hezekiah's Tunnel, a remarkable engineering feat of the 8th century BC \(2 Chr. 32:30; Isa. 22:11\). 

The pool is mentioned in various contexts throughout the Bible. In the time of Nehemiah, the wall of Jerusalem was repaired near the Pool of Shelah \(Neh. 3:15\), and Nehemiah himself inspected the walls by the King's Pool \(Neh. 2:14\). The prophet Isaiah used the gently flowing waters of Shiloah as a metaphor for the calm and trust in God, in contrast to the mighty waters of the Euphrates, symbolizing the Assyrian threat \(Isa. 8:6\). 

In the New Testament, Jesus healed a man born blind by sending him to wash in the Pool of Siloam \([[John.9.7|John 9:7]], 11\). This miracle not only demonstrated Jesus' power but also served as a spiritual lesson about faith and the true identity of the Messiah. The Gospel of Luke also records an incident where eighteen people were killed when the tower of Siloam fell on them \([[Luke.13.4|Luke 13:4]]\), using this event to teach about the need for repentance. 

The Pool of Siloam has been identified with the archaeological site known as the Siloam Pool, which was discovered in 2004. Excavations have revealed a large pool from the Second Temple period, consistent with the biblical descriptions and historical accounts of the site.
