Haran was the son of Terah and the brother of Abraham and Nahor, as mentioned in [[Gen.11.26|Genesis 11:26]]-31. He was born in Ur of the Chaldeans, where his family originally lived. Haran was the father of Lot, Milcah, and Iscah \(Genesis 11:27, 29\). Milcah later married Haran's brother Nahor \([[Gen.11.29|Genesis 11:29]]\). Tragically, Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in Ur before the family's migration to Haran \([[Gen.11.28|Genesis 11:28]]\). After Haran's death, Terah took his son Abram \(later known as Abraham\), his grandson Lot, and his daughter-in-law Sarai \(later known as Sarah\) and set out from Ur to go to the land of Canaan. However, they settled in the city of Haran, which was named after Terah's deceased son \([[Gen.11.31|Genesis 11:31]]\). Haran's death in Ur was a significant event in the family's history, as it marked the beginning of their journey towards the land that God would later promise to Abraham and his descendants.
