Ahimelech, the son of Abiathar, was a priest who served during the reign of King David. He is mentioned alongside Zadok, another prominent priest, suggesting that they held important positions in the priestly hierarchy. \([[2Sam.8.17|2Sa.8.17]]; [[1Chr.18.16|1Ch.18.16]]\) 

In the context of organizing the priestly divisions, Ahimelech is listed among the descendants of Ithamar, one of Aaron's sons. The priests were divided into groups to carry out their duties in the tabernacle and later in the temple. \([[1Chr.24.3|1Ch.24.3]],6\). 

Ahimelech's father, Abiathar, had a significant role in David's life, supporting him during his flight from Saul and later serving as a priest and advisor to David. \(1Sa.22.20-23; 2Sa.15.24-29\) 

Although not much is recorded about Ahimelech's specific actions, his position as a priest during David's reign indicates that he played a role in the religious life of Israel and in serving the king.
