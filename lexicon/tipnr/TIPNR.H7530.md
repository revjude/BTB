Rezeph is mentioned in the Bible as one of the cities conquered by the Assyrians. It appears in a letter from the Assyrian king Sennacherib to Hezekiah, king of Judah, boasting about the Assyrian conquests \(2 Ki. 19:12; Isa. 37:12\). The letter implies that Rezeph was a significant city, but its gods were unable to save it from the Assyrians. The exact location of Rezeph is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the region of Syria or Mesopotamia.
