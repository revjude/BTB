Prophetess living at the time of the Patriarchs

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Deborah</span>, Rebekah's nurse, died and was buried under an oak below Bethel. \([[Gen.35.8|Gen.35.8]]\)
- A prophetess living at the time of the Patriarchs, only mentioned at [[Gen.35.8|Gen.35.8]]; 
- only referred to as Deborah **<big>[[H1683|דְּבּוֹרָה]]</big>**.

Deborah is mentioned briefly in [[Gen.35.8|Genesis 35:8]] as the nurse of Rebekah, the wife of Isaac. The context of this passage is Jacob's return to Bethel, where he had previously encountered God in a dream \(Genesis 28:10-22\). 

As Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and his household journeyed to Bethel, Deborah died and was buried under an oak tree below Bethel. The oak tree was then called Allon-bacuth, which means "Oak of Weeping," indicating the mourning that took place at her burial site. 

The mention of Deborah's death and burial at this point in the narrative suggests that she had been with Jacob's family for a long time, likely since Rebekah's marriage to Isaac.
