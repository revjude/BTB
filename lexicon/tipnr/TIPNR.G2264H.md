Herod Antipas was the son of Herod the Great and ruled as tetrarch of Galilee and Perea during the time of Jesus' ministry. He is mentioned in the Gospels in connection with the imprisonment and execution of John the Baptist \([[Matt.14.3|Mat.14.3]],6; [[Mark.6.17|Mrk.6.17]]-29; [[Luke.3.1|Luk.3.1]]9-20\). Herod Antipas had married Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, which John the Baptist condemned as unlawful. In retaliation, Herodias's daughter danced for Herod Antipas and requested the head of John the Baptist as a reward. Herod, though reluctant, fulfilled her request and had John beheaded. During Jesus' ministry, Herod Antipas heard about Jesus' miracles and teachings and was perplexed, thinking that John the Baptist had risen from the dead \([[Matt.14.1|Mat.14.1]]-2; [[Mark.6.14|Mrk.6.14]]-16; [[Luke.9.7|Luk.9.7]]-9\). Later, during Jesus' trial, Pontius Pilate sent Jesus to Herod Antipas, who was in Jerusalem at the time \(Luk.23.7-12\). Herod Antipas questioned Jesus, hoping to see a miracle, but Jesus remained silent. Herod and his soldiers mocked Jesus, dressed him in an elegant robe, and sent him back to Pilate. This encounter between Herod Antipas and Jesus is unique to the Gospel of Luke.
