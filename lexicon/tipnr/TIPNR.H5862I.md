In [[2Chr.11.6|2 Chronicles 11:6]], Etam is mentioned as one of the cities that King Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, fortified in Judah after the kingdom was divided. Rehoboam's kingdom consisted of the southern tribes of Judah and Benjamin, while the northern tribes followed Jeroboam I. 

As part of his efforts to strengthen his reign and defend his territory, Rehoboam built up the defenses of several key cities, including Etam. The fortification of Etam suggests that it was a strategically important location, possibly guarding a trade route or protecting the southern border of Judah. 

The exact location of this Etam is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the hill country of Judah, possibly near Bethlehem. Some scholars propose that it may be the same as the Etam mentioned in Judges 15, where Samson hid from the Philistines, but this is not conclusively established.
