- A woman living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.25.1|Gen.25.1]]; 
- only referred to as Keturah<[[H6989]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ק</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>טו</span>ּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>\); 
- wife of Abraham<[[H0085]]>; 
-  mother of Zimran<[[H2175]]>, Jokshan<[[H3370]]>, Medan<[[H4091]]>, Midian<[[H4080G]]>, Ishbak<[[H3435]]> and Shuah<[[H7744]]>.

Keturah is mentioned in [[Gen.25.1|Genesis 25:1]], 4 and [[1Chr.1.32|1 Chronicles 1:32]], 33 as the wife Abraham took after the death of Sarah. She is described as Abraham's concubine, which in the context of the ancient Near East, was a secondary wife with legal rights and status. 

Keturah bore Abraham six sons: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah \(Genesis 25:2; [[1Chr.1.32|1 Chronicles 1:32]]\). These sons became the ancestors of various tribes and nations, expanding Abraham's descendants beyond the primary line of Isaac and Ishmael. 

Abraham gave gifts to the sons of Keturah and sent them away to the east, separating them from his son Isaac to avoid conflict over the inheritance \(Genesis 25:6\). This action ensured that Isaac, the child of promise, would be the primary heir of Abraham's legacy and covenant blessings. 

The mention of Keturah and her sons in the genealogies of Abraham demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promise to make Abraham a father of many nations \(Genesis 17:4-6\). It also highlights the complexity of family relationships and the importance of preserving the line of Isaac as the chosen heir of the covenant promises.
