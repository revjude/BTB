- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.49|Ezr.2.49]]; 
- only referred to as Besai<[[H1153]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>ֵּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ס</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>\).

Besai was the ancestor of a group of temple servants \(Nethinim\) who returned to Jerusalem from the Babylonian captivity \(Ezr. 2:49; Neh. 7:52\). The Nethinim were a class of people assigned to assist the Levites in the maintenance and service of the temple. They were likely descendants of the Gibeonites, who had been appointed by Joshua to serve as woodcutters and water carriers for the congregation and the altar of the Lord \(Josh. 9:27\). The return of Besai's descendants, along with other Nethinim, demonstrates the restoration of temple worship and the importance of the Nethinim's role in supporting the Levites' ministry.
