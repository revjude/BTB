Hammedatha is mentioned in the book of Esther as the father of Haman, the primary antagonist who plotted to destroy the Jews in the Persian Empire. He is identified as an Agagite \([[Esth.3.1|Esther 3:1]]\), which suggests that he may have been a descendant of Agag, the Amalekite king who was defeated by King Saul \(1 Samuel 15\). Hammedatha's son, Haman, rose to a high position in the court of King Ahasuerus \(Xerxes I\) and used his influence to persuade the king to issue a decree ordering the extermination of all Jews in the empire \(Esther 3:8-15\). However, Queen Esther and her cousin Mordecai ultimately thwarted Haman's plans, leading to his downfall and execution, along with his ten sons \(Esther 7-9\). The mention of Hammedatha in the book of Esther serves to provide background information on Haman's lineage and to emphasize the long-standing enmity between the Amalekites and the Israelites.
