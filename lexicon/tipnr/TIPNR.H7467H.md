Reuel is briefly mentioned in the genealogy of the tribe of Benjamin \([[1Chr.9.8|1 Chronicles 9:8]]\). He was the son of Ibnijah, who was a descendant of Benjamin, the youngest son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\). The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 9 lists some of the prominent families and individuals who lived in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. It is possible that Reuel and his family were among those who returned to Jerusalem and settled there. However, no additional information is provided about Reuel's life or specific role within the tribe of Benjamin. His inclusion in the genealogy serves to document the family lines and descendants of Benjamin.
