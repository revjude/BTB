Osnappar is mentioned in the Bible as the king who brought people from various regions and settled them in the cities of Samaria \([[Ezra.4.10|Ezra 4:10]]\). He is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, but many scholars identify him as Ashurbanipal, one of the last great kings of the Assyrian Empire. Ashurbanipal ruled from 668 to 627 BC and was known for his military campaigns and his extensive library in Nineveh. The resettlement of people in Samaria was a common practice of the Assyrian kings to prevent rebellions and maintain control over conquered territories. The people who were brought to Samaria came from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim \(Ezra 4:9-10\). These foreign settlers intermarried with the remaining Israelites in Samaria, creating a mixed population that became known as the Samaritans \(2 Kings 17:24-41\). The Samaritans developed their own religious practices, which combined elements of Israelite and pagan traditions, and were often in conflict with the Jews who returned from the Babylonian exile \(Ezra 4:1-5; Nehemiah 4:1-3\).
