Rehabiah was the son of Eliezer and grandson of Moses \(1 Chronicles 23:17\). He was a Levite and had many descendants who were also Levites \(1 Chronicles 23:17\). The Levites were responsible for assisting the priests in the temple service and had various duties assigned to them. Rehabiah's descendants were among the Levites who served during the reign of King David \(1 Chronicles 24:21\). They were also among the Levites who were appointed as treasurers and other officials \([[1Chr.26.25|1 Chronicles 26:25]]\). The multiple mentions of Rehabiah and his descendants in the genealogies and lists of Levites highlight the importance of their role in maintaining the worship and service of God in the temple.
