Haggith was one of King David's wives and the mother of Adonijah, who was David's fourth son \([[2Sam.3.4|2 Samuel 3:4]], [[1Chr.3.2|1 Chronicles 3:2]]\). Adonijah was born in Hebron during the early years of David's reign. After the death of his older brothers Amnon and Absalom, Adonijah considered himself the heir to the throne and attempted to claim it while David was still alive \([[1Kgs.1.5|1 Kings 1:5]]\). He gained the support of Joab, the commander of the army, and Abiathar, the priest \(1 Kings 1:7\). However, David had promised Bathsheba that their son Solomon would be the next king \(1 Kings 1:17\). When David was informed of Adonijah's actions, he ordered Solomon to be anointed as king \(1 Kings 1:32-35\). Fearing for his life, Adonijah sought asylum by clinging to the horns of the altar \([[1Kgs.1.5|1 Kings 1:5]]0\). Solomon spared his life on the condition that he would show himself to be a worthy man \([[1Kgs.1.5|1 Kings 1:5]]2-53\). Later, Adonijah made a request to Solomon through Bathsheba, asking for Abishag, David's nurse, to be given to him as a wife \([[1Kgs.2.13|1 Kings 2:13]]-17\). Solomon perceived this as a threat to his throne and ordered Adonijah to be put to death \(1 Kings 2:23-25\).
