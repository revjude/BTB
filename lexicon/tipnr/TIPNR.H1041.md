Beth-azmaveth, also known as Azmaveth, was a town in the territory of Benjamin mentioned in the context of the return from the Babylonian exile. In [[Ezra.2.24|Ezra 2:24]] and [[Neh.7.28|Nehemiah 7:28]], the people of Beth-azmaveth are listed among those who returned to Judah with Zerubbabel. 

The name Beth-azmaveth means "house of Azmaveth" or "house of the strong one of death" in Hebrew. Azmaveth was also the name of one of David's mighty men \(2 Samuel 23:31; 1 Chronicles 11:33\), but it is unclear if there is any connection between the town and the individual. 

In [[Neh.12.29|Nehemiah 12:29]], Beth-azmaveth is mentioned again as one of the places where the Levites settled after returning from exile. The Levites were responsible for serving in the temple and assisting the priests in their duties. 

The exact location of Beth-azmaveth is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated within the territory of Benjamin, north of Jerusalem. The town's mention in the context of the return from exile suggests that it was resettled by the Israelites who came back to their homeland after the Babylonian captivity.
