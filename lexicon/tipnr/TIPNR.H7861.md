Shitrai is mentioned in [[1Chr.27.29|1 Chronicles 27:29]] as the Sharonite who was responsible for overseeing King David's herds that grazed in the fertile plain of Sharon. This chapter lists the various officials and administrators responsible for managing the king's assets and resources. As the overseer of the royal herds in Sharon, Shitrai would have been tasked with ensuring the well-being, growth, and productivity of the livestock in that region. The plain of Sharon, located along the Mediterranean coast of Israel, was known for its rich pastures and was well-suited for grazing cattle and other livestock. Shitrai's role suggests that he had expertise in animal husbandry and was entrusted with managing an important portion of the king's wealth.
