<small>*Male • Fellow soldier and minister in Colossae*</small>

Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Archippus</span>, addressed as a fellow soldier by Paul, was urged to complete the ministry he had received in the Lord.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Col.4.17|Col.4.17]]; 
- only referred to as Archippus **<big>[[G0751|Ἄρχιππος]]</big>**.

Archippus was a member of the early Christian church, mentioned by Paul in his letters to the Colossians and to Philemon. In the letter to the Colossians, Paul instructs the church to tell Archippus, "See to it that you complete the ministry you have received in the Lord" \(Col. 4:17\). This suggests that Archippus held a position of responsibility within the church at Colossae and that Paul wanted to encourage him to fulfill his duties faithfully. 

In the letter to Philemon, Archippus is addressed alongside Philemon and Apphia as a "fellow soldier" \(Phm. 1:2\). This military metaphor indicates that Archippus was a committed and active member of the Christian community, working alongside others to advance the gospel message. The inclusion of Archippus in the opening of this personal letter also suggests a close relationship between him and Paul, as well as with Philemon and Apphia. 

While no further details about Archippus' life or specific ministry are provided in the biblical text, these brief mentions highlight his importance within the early church and Paul's desire to encourage and support him in his Christian service.
