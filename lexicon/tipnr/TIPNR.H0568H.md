- A High Priest from the tribe of Levi living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at 1Ch.6.11; 
- only referred to as Amariah **<big>[[H0568|אֲמַרְיָה]]</big>**; 
- a son of Azariah **<big>[[H5838|עֲזַרְיָה]]</big>**; 
-  father of Ahitub **<big>[[H0285|אֲחִיטוּב]]</big>**.

Amariah is mentioned in the genealogies of the Levitical priesthood as a descendant of Aaron through his son Eleazar. He served as the high priest during the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah. \(1Ch.6.11\) 

As a high priest, Amariah would have been responsible for overseeing the temple worship, offering sacrifices, and leading the other priests in their duties. He played a significant role in the religious life of Judah during Jehoshaphat's reign. 

Jehoshaphat was known for his devotion to God and his efforts to reform and strengthen the religious and judicial systems in Judah. \(2Ch.17.1-9; 19.4-11\) As the high priest, Amariah would have supported and collaborated with the king in these endeavors. 

In the genealogy of Ezra the scribe, who led a group of exiles back to Jerusalem during the Persian period, Amariah is listed as one of his ancestors. \([[Ezra.7.3|Ezr.7.3]]\) This connection highlights the continuity of the priestly lineage and the importance of the high priestly office in the religious leadership of Israel. 

Apart from these brief mentions, no further details are provided about Amariah's life, his specific actions as high priest, or any other significant events associated with him. 

The inclusion of Amariah in the genealogies emphasizes the significance of the high priestly office, the continuity of the Aaronic priesthood, and the role of the priests in maintaining the religious life of Israel throughout its history.
