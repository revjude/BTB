Genesis 19:30-38 tells the story of Lot's two unnamed daughters following the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The younger daughter, like her elder sister, believed that they were the only survivors and that there were no men to father their children. She followed her sister's plan to sleep with their father. After getting Lot drunk, she lay with him and conceived a son named Ben-ammi, who became the ancestor of the Ammonite people. The Bible does not provide additional information about the younger daughter's life or character, but her actions, like those of her sister, reflect the desperation and moral decay of the time.
