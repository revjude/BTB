Zaccur, a priest, was one of the individuals appointed by Nehemiah to serve as a treasurer for the storehouses. These storehouses were used to collect the tithes of grain, new wine, and oil that were brought by the people for the support of the Levites and priests. Nehemiah chose Zaccur, along with Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites, because they were considered trustworthy. Their responsibility was to oversee the distribution of the offerings to their fellow Levites and priests.
