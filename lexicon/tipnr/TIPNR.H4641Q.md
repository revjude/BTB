Maaseiah was a Levite who assisted Ezra in reading the Law to the people during the time of Nehemiah \([[Neh.8.4|Neh.8.4]]\). After the completion of the wall of Jerusalem, the people gathered in the square before the Water Gate to hear Ezra read from the Book of the Law \(Neh.8.1-3\). Maaseiah is listed among the Levites who stood beside Ezra on a raised platform and helped to explain the Law to the people \([[Neh.8.4|Neh.8.4]],7\). The reading of the Law was a significant event in the spiritual renewal of the Jewish community, as they recommitted themselves to the covenant with God and the observance of His commandments. The involvement of Maaseiah and other Levites in this event highlights their role as teachers and interpreters of the Law, guiding the people in their understanding and application of God's word.
