Puah, also referred to as Puvah, was one of the sons of Issachar, who was a son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) \([[Gen.46.13|Genesis 46:13]]; [[1Chr.7.1|1 Chronicles 7:1]]\). He was born during the time when Jacob and his family were living in Canaan, before their migration to Egypt. In [[Num.26.23|Numbers 26:23]], the descendants of Puah are mentioned as part of the census of the Israelites in the wilderness, where they are referred to as the Punites. This census was taken in preparation for the allocation of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel. The inclusion of the Punites in this census indicates that Puah's descendants had grown into a significant clan within the tribe of Issachar.
