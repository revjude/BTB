Ziha was the name of a family of temple servants, also known as Nethinim, who returned to Jerusalem from Babylonian captivity. They are mentioned in the lists of returnees in both Ezra 2 and Nehemiah 7. The Nethinim were a group of people who were assigned to assist the Levites in the maintenance and service of the temple. The name "Nethinim" means "given ones" or "dedicated ones," indicating their special role in supporting the temple worship. The fact that the family of Ziha is specifically named in these lists suggests that they were a significant group among the temple servants. Their return to Jerusalem, along with the other exiles, was part of the effort to restore the temple and reestablish Jewish worship in the land.
