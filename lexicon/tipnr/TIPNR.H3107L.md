Jozabad is mentioned in [[2Chr.35.9|2 Chronicles 35:9]] as one of the Levitical leaders who contributed to the Passover celebrations during the reign of King Josiah. The context of the passage is Josiah's restoration of the Passover observance as part of his religious reforms \(2 Chronicles 35:1-19\). 

In preparation for the Passover, the Levitical leaders generously provided animals for the offerings. Jozabad, along with Conaniah, Shemaiah, Nethanel, and his brothers Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, gave 5,000 lambs and young goats and 500 oxen from their own possessions for the Passover offerings \([[2Chr.35.9|2 Chronicles 35:9]]\). 

This contribution demonstrated the Levitical leaders' support for Josiah's reforms and their commitment to the proper observance of the Passover.
