- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Neh.8.7|Neh.8.7]]; 
- only referred to as Hanan<[[H2605K]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ח</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ן</span>\).

Hanan is mentioned in [[Neh.8.7|Nehemiah 8:7]] as one of the Levites who helped Ezra, the priest and scribe, in explaining the Law to the people. After the return from Babylonian exile, Ezra read the Book of the Law to the assembled Israelites during the Feast of Tabernacles \(Nehemiah 8:1-3\). Hanan, along with several other Levites, stood beside Ezra and helped the people understand the Law, translating and explaining it clearly \([[Neh.8.7|Nehemiah 8:7]]-8\). This event marked a significant moment in the spiritual revival of the post-exilic community, as the people rediscovered and recommitted themselves to the teachings of the Law. In [[Neh.10.10|Nehemiah 10:10]], Hanan is also listed among the Levites who signed the covenant to follow the Law of God, demonstrating his commitment to the spiritual renewal of the people.
