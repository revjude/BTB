Beer, meaning "well" in Hebrew, is mentioned in [[Num.21.16|Numbers 21:16]] as a place where God instructed Moses to gather the people, and He would provide water for them. This event occurred during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness after the Exodus from Egypt. 

The Israelites had been complaining about the lack of water, and God responded by directing Moses to assemble the people at Beer. There, God provided water for them, demonstrating His provision and care for His people in the desert. 

The exact location of Beer is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely somewhere in the region of Moab, east of the Jordan River, as the Israelites were traveling through that area at the time.
