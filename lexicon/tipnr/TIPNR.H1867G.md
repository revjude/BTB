- Emperor living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.12.22|Neh.12.22]]; 
- only referred to as Darius<[[H1867G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ָּֽ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ָ֫<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ו</span>ֶ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ש</span>ׁ\).

Darius, mentioned in [[Neh.12.22|Nehemiah 12:22]], was a Persian king who reigned during the time of the Levites Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua. This passage is part of a list of priests and Levites who served in the Temple after the Babylonian exile. 

The mention of Darius in this context serves as a historical marker, indicating that these Levites served during his reign. This Darius is likely Darius II Nothus, who ruled the Persian Empire from 423 to 404 BC. 

The inclusion of Darius' name in this list demonstrates the continuity of the priestly and Levitical service in the Temple, even under Persian rule. It also shows that the Jewish community in Jerusalem maintained their religious practices and recorded their history during this period.
