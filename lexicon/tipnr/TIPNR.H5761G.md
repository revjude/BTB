People who lived in modern Gaza

The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Avvim</span> were an ancient people who inhabited the Gaza area before being destroyed by the Caphtorim \(Deut 2:23; Josh 13:3\).
- People who lived in modern Gaza, first mentioned at [[Luke.3.1|Deu.2.23]]; 
- only referred to as Avvim **<big>[[H5761|עַוִּים]]</big>**.

The Avvim were an ancient people mentioned in the Old Testament as early inhabitants of the Gaza region. In Deuteronomy 2:23, it is stated that the Avvim lived in villages as far as Gaza until the Caphtorim \(Philistines\) came from Caphtor and destroyed them, settling in their place. [[Josh.13.3|Joshua 13:3]] also mentions the Avvim as one of the groups living in the land that remained to be conquered by the Israelites. The Avvim are not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, and little is known about their culture or history outside of these brief references. Their destruction by the Caphtorim \(Philistines\) suggests that they were one of the many people groups displaced or assimilated during the Bronze Age and early Iron Age in the region.
