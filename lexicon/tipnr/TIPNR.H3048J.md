Jedaiah is mentioned in [[Zech.6.10|Zechariah 6:10]] and 6:14 as one of the returned exiles who provided silver and gold for the crowns that were to be placed on the head of Joshua, the high priest. In a symbolic act, Zechariah was instructed to take silver and gold from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, who had recently arrived from Babylon. The prophet was to make crowns from the precious metals and set them on Joshua's head, signifying the coming of the Branch \(the Messiah\) who would build the temple of the Lord and rule as both priest and king. The crowns were to be kept in the temple as a memorial to Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah. This prophetic act emphasizes the importance of the priesthood and the anticipation of the Messiah's coming, who would fulfill the roles of both priest and king.
