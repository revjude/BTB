Moses' sister living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Miriam</span>, the sister of Moses and Aaron, was a prophetess who played a significant role in the Exodus and the Israelites' journey through the wilderness.
- Moses' sister from the tribe of Levi living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Exod.15.20|Exo.15.20]]; 
- only referred to as Miriam<[[H4813G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>מ</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ם</span>\); 
-  daughter of Amram<[[H6019G]]> and Jochebed<[[H3115]]>; 
- a sister of Moses<[[H4872]]> and Aaron<[[H0175]]>.

Miriam was the sister of Moses and Aaron, and a prominent figure in the Exodus narrative. She first appears in [[Exod.15.20|Exodus 15:20]]-21, where she is described as a prophetess who led the women of Israel in worship and dance after the crossing of the Red Sea. This event highlights her leadership role among the women and her musical abilities. 

However, Miriam's life was not without controversy. In [[Num.12.1|Numbers 12:1]]-15, she and Aaron criticized Moses for marrying a Cushite woman and challenged his authority as God's chosen leader. As a result, God punished Miriam with leprosy, but she was healed after Moses interceded on her behalf. This incident serves as a warning against questioning God's appointed leaders. 

Miriam's death is recorded in [[Num.20.1|Numbers 20:1]], which takes place near the end of the Israelites' forty years of wandering in the wilderness. Her significance in Israel's history is further emphasized in [[Mic.6.4|Micah 6:4]], where she is mentioned alongside Moses and Aaron as one of the leaders God sent to guide the people out of Egypt.
