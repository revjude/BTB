The King's Valley, also known as the Valley of Shaveh, was a valley located near the ancient city of Salem, which is believed to be Jerusalem. It is mentioned twice in the Bible in connection with significant events. In Genesis 14:17, the King's Valley is the place where Melchizedek, the king of Salem and priest of God Most High, met Abraham after his victory over Chedorlaomer and the kings allied with him. Melchizedek blessed Abraham and received a tithe from him. Later, in [[2Sam.18.18|2 Samuel 18:18]], it is mentioned that Absalom, King David's rebellious son, had erected a pillar for himself in the King's Valley during his lifetime, as he had no son to preserve his name. The exact location of the King's Valley is uncertain, but it was likely situated near Jerusalem, possibly in the Kidron Valley or the Hinnom Valley.
