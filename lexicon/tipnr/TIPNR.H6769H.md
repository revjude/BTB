In 1 Chronicles 12, Zillethai is mentioned as one of the Manassite leaders who joined David at Ziklag when he was seeking refuge from King Saul. The chapter lists the warriors from various tribes who allied themselves with David during this time, recognizing him as the future king of Israel. Zillethai is named along with several other Manassite leaders, including Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, and Elihu. These men are described as brave warriors and commanders, indicating that they held positions of leadership within their tribe. The support of these Manassite leaders would have been valuable to David as he gathered allies and built his army in preparation for his eventual reign as king. The fact that Zillethai and the others joined David at Ziklag demonstrates their loyalty and belief in his divine appointment as Israel's future ruler.
