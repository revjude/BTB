Shuthelah is mentioned in [[1Chr.7.21|1 Chronicles 7:21]] as a descendant of Ephraim, specifically the son of Zabad. This genealogy traces the lineage of the tribe of Ephraim, focusing on the descendants of Ephraim's sons Shuthelah, Bered, Tahath, and Eladah. In this particular verse, Shuthelah is listed as the son of Zabad, who was likely a later descendant of the earlier Shuthelah mentioned in the same genealogy \(1 Chronicles 7:20\). The passage goes on to describe a conflict between the Ephraimites and the men of Gath, resulting in the death of some of Ephraim's descendants. However, no further details about this specific Shuthelah's life or role are provided in the text.
