People from Horon\(?\)

The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Horonites</span> were a people group who opposed Nehemiah's efforts to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
- People from Horon\(?\), first mentioned at [[Neh.2.10|Neh.2.10]]; 
- only referred to as Horonites<[[H2772]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ח</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>\).

The Horonites were a people group mentioned in the book of Nehemiah who opposed the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem. They are named after their place of origin, Horonaim, a city in Moab. 

Sanballat the Horonite is mentioned as one of the main adversaries of Nehemiah \([[Neh.2.10|Nehemiah 2:10]], 19\). Along with Tobiah the Ammonite and Geshem the Arab, Sanballat mocked and ridiculed the Jews' efforts to rebuild the city walls \([[Neh.2.19|Nehemiah 2:19]]\). They also conspired to attack Jerusalem and create confusion among the builders \(Nehemiah 4:7-8\). 

In [[Neh.13.28|Nehemiah 13:28]], it is mentioned that one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. This marriage alliance was a cause of concern for Nehemiah, as it compromised the purity and integrity of the priesthood. Nehemiah took action by driving the man away from his presence. 

The opposition of the Horonites and their allies reflects the political and social tensions that existed during the time of Nehemiah. The rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls was not only a physical task but also a symbolic act of restoring the Jewish identity and autonomy in the face of foreign opposition.
