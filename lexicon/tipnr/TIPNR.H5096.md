Nahalol, also known as Nahalal, was a Levitical city in the territory allotted to the tribe of Zebulun \(Josh. 19:15; 21:35\). It was one of the cities given to the Levites from the tribe of Zebulun, along with Kartah, Dimnah, and Rimmon. Nahalol was located in the Galilean hills, but its exact location is uncertain. According to [[Judg.1.30|Judges 1:30]], the Zebulunites failed to drive out the Canaanite inhabitants of Nahalol, who remained and were put to forced labor.
