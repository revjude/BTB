- A man from the tribe of Judah living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, only mentioned at [[1Chr.4.3|1Ch.4.3]]; 
- only referred to as Idbash<[[H3031]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>ָּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ש</span>ׁ\); 
-  son of Hur<[[H2354G]]>; 
- a brother of Uri<[[H0221G]]>, Shobal<[[H7732H]]>, Salma<[[H8007H]]>, Hareph<[[H2780]]>, Jezreel<[[H3157J]]>, Ishma<[[H3457]]>, Hazzelelponi<[[H6753]]>, Penuel<[[H6439H]]> and Ezer<[[H5829G]]>.

Idbash is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.4.3|1 Chronicles 4:3]] as one of the sons of Etam, a descendant of Judah. He is listed along with his brothers Jezreel and Ishma. 

The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 4 records the descendants of Judah, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. This chapter provides a detailed account of the families and clans within the tribe of Judah, tracing their lineage from the patriarch Judah himself. 

Idbash's mention in this genealogy suggests that he was a significant figure within his family and clan. The inclusion of his name, along with his brothers, indicates that they were recognized as important members of the tribe of Judah. 

However, apart from this brief mention, no other details are provided about Idbash's life, accomplishments, or role within the tribe. The genealogical record serves primarily to establish the family lines and to highlight the importance of tribal identity and heritage in ancient Israelite society. 

The name Idbash is unique and does not appear elsewhere in the Bible. Its meaning is uncertain, although some scholars suggest it may be related to the Hebrew word for "honey" or "sweetness."
