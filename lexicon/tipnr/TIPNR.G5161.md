- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Judg.10.1|Act.20.4]]; 
- only referred to as Trophimus **<big>[[G5161|Τρόφιμος]]</big>**.

Trophimus was a Gentile Christian from Ephesus who accompanied the Apostle Paul on his missionary journeys \(Acts 20:4\). He was one of several individuals who traveled with Paul from Greece to Asia Minor, carrying the collection for the poor in Jerusalem. In Jerusalem, some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul in the temple and falsely accused him of bringing Trophimus, a Gentile, into the restricted areas of the temple \(Acts 21:29\). This incident led to Paul's arrest and eventual imprisonment. Later, in his second letter to Timothy, Paul mentions that he had left Trophimus sick in Miletus \([[2Tim.4.20|2 Timothy 4:20]]\). Trophimus' presence with Paul highlights the inclusion of Gentiles in the early church and the challenges faced by Paul and his companions as they ministered in various cultural contexts.
