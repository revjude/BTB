Ahimaaz was the son of Zadok, the high priest during the reign of King David. He played a significant role as a messenger and loyal supporter of David during the rebellion of David's son Absalom. Along with Jonathan, son of Abiathar, Ahimaaz stayed outside Jerusalem to relay information about Absalom's plans to David. \([[2Sam.15.27|2Sa.15.27]],36; 17.17\) 

When David's forces defeated Absalom's army, Ahimaaz wanted to bring the news to David, but Joab initially sent a Cushite messenger instead. Ahimaaz persisted and was allowed to run, overtaking the Cushite. He reported the victory to David but withheld the news of Absalom's death, which the Cushite messenger revealed. \([[2Sam.18.19|2Sa.18.19]]-29\) 

In the genealogy of the Levites, Ahimaaz is listed as the son of Zadok and the father of Azariah, who served as priests in the temple built by Solomon. \([[1Chr.6.8|1Ch.6.8]],9,53\) Ahimaaz's loyalty to David and his role in supporting the rightful king showcase his importance during this tumultuous period in Israel's history.
