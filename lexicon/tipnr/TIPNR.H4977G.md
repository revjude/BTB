Mattan was a priest of Baal during the reign of Athaliah, the queen mother of Judah. When Jehoiada the priest led a revolt to overthrow Athaliah and restore the rightful king, Joash, to the throne, the temple of Baal was destroyed. Mattan, as a priest of Baal, was killed in front of the altars of his pagan temple \([[2Kgs.11.18|2 Kings 11:18]]; [[2Chr.23.17|2 Chronicles 23:17]]\). This event marked a significant moment in Jehoiada's religious reforms, which aimed to restore the worship of the Lord and eliminate idolatry in Judah.
