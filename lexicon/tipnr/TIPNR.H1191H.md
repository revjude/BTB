Baalath is mentioned in [[1Kgs.9.18|1 Kings 9:18]] and [[2Chr.8.6|2 Chronicles 8:6]] as one of the towns that King Solomon built and fortified during his reign. The passages state that Solomon built Baalath along with Tadmor in the wilderness and other store cities in Hamath. The exact location of this Baalath is not specified, but based on its association with Tadmor \(Palmyra\) and Hamath, it was likely situated in the region of Lebanon or Syria. These fortified cities were probably constructed to secure trade routes and establish Solomon's control over the region.
