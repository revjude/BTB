Berechiah was a Levite who served as a gatekeeper in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. He was the son of Asa and a descendant of Elkanah \(1 Ch. 9:16\). As a gatekeeper, Berechiah was responsible for guarding the entrances to the temple and maintaining order within the sacred precincts. He lived in the villages of the Netophathites, a group of people who resided in the vicinity of Jerusalem. Berechiah's role as a gatekeeper highlights the importance of the Levites in preserving the sanctity and security of the temple during the post-exilic period.
