Elizur, the son of Shedeur, was a prominent leader from the tribe of Reuben during the Israelites' wilderness journey after the Exodus from Egypt. He was appointed as the leader of the Reubenites and was responsible for organizing and leading the tribe in various aspects of the journey \([[Num.1.5|Num.1.5]]\). Elizur's duties included assisting in the census of the Israelites \([[Num.1.5|Num.1.5]]\), overseeing the encampment of the Reubenites on the south side of the tabernacle \([[Num.2.10|Num.2.10]]\), presenting the tribe's offerings at the dedication of the tabernacle \([[Num.7.30|Num.7.30]],35\), and leading the Reubenites in the order of march \([[Num.10.18|Num.10.18]]\). As a tribal leader, Elizur played a significant role in the administrative and military organization of the Israelites during their time in the wilderness. The Bible does not provide any further details about Elizur's life or leadership beyond these specific responsibilities.
