Eliada is briefly mentioned in [[1Kgs.11.23|1 Kings 11:23]] as the father of Rezon, who became an adversary to King Solomon. Rezon was an Aramean commander who fled from his master, Hadadezer, the king of Zobah, after David had defeated Hadadezer's army. Rezon gathered a band of men and became the leader of a raiding party. He later established himself as king in Damascus and posed a threat to Israel during Solomon's reign.
