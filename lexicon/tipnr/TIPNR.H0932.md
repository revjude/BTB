- A man living before Israel's Monarchy, first mentioned at [[Josh.15.6|Jos.15.6]]; 
- only referred to as Bohan<[[H0932]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>ֹּ֫<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ן</span>\).

Bohan was the son of Reuben, the eldest son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) \(Josh. 15:6; 18:17\). He is mentioned in connection with a boundary stone that marked the border between the territories of Judah and Benjamin. The stone was named "the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben," suggesting that it was a well-known landmark during the time of the Israelite conquest and settlement of Canaan. The stone is referenced in the descriptions of the allotment of land to the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, emphasizing the importance of clear boundaries and the fair distribution of the Promised Land among the Israelite tribes. The fact that the stone bore Bohan's name indicates that he may have played a significant role in establishing or recognizing this boundary marker. However, no further details about Bohan's life or achievements are provided in the biblical text.
