Elhanan is mentioned in [[2Sam.21.19|2 Samuel 21:19]] and [[1Chr.20.5|1 Chronicles 20:5]] as a warrior from Bethlehem who fought against the Philistines. In 2 Samuel, he is described as the son of Jaare-oregim, while in 1 Chronicles, he is called the son of Jair. Elhanan is noted for killing Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite. This event is similar to David's famous battle with Goliath, but Elhanan's victory highlights the ongoing conflicts between Israel and the Philistines. The passages suggest that Elhanan was a skilled warrior who played a significant role in Israel's military successes.
