Jozabad is mentioned in [[2Chr.31.13|2 Chronicles 31:13]] as one of the Levites appointed by King Hezekiah to oversee the distribution of contributions to the priests and Levites. The context of the passage is Hezekiah's religious reforms and the restoration of proper worship in Judah \(2 Chronicles 31:1-21\). 

After the people brought in abundant contributions, tithes, and dedicated gifts \(2 Chronicles 31:5-6\), Hezekiah appointed officers to oversee the distribution of these offerings. Jozabad, along with Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah, was appointed as an overseer under the direction of Conaniah and his brother Shimei, the chief officers \(2 Chronicles 31:12-13\). 

These overseers were entrusted with the task of ensuring that the contributions were faithfully distributed to the priests and Levites according to their divisions and duties \(2 Chronicles 31:14-19\).
