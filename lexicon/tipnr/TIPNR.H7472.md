- A man living at the time of United Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Kgs.1.8|1Ki.1.8]]; 
- only referred to as Rei **<big>[[H7472|רֵעִי]]</big>**.

Rei is mentioned briefly in the book of 1 Kings as one of the people who did not join Adonijah in his attempt to become king \([[1Kgs.1.8|1 Kings 1:8]]\). Adonijah was one of King David's sons who tried to seize the throne near the end of David's life, even though David had promised the succession to his son Solomon \(1 Kings 1:5-10\). Rei, along with Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and others, remained loyal to Solomon \([[1Kgs.1.8|1 Kings 1:8]]\). They did not attend the feast where Adonijah declared himself king \(1 Kings 1:9-10\). When David was informed of Adonijah's actions, he ordered Solomon to be anointed as king, with the support of those who had remained loyal \(1 Kings 1:32-40\). Rei's loyalty to Solomon during this critical time helped ensure a smooth transition of power and the fulfillment of David's choice of successor.
