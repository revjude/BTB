Hashmonah was a desert campsite mentioned in the book of Numbers as one of the places where the Israelites stopped during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. It is listed in [[Num.33.29|Numbers 33:29]]-30, which records the stages of Israel's journey in the wilderness. 

According to the text, the Israelites set out from Mithkah and camped at Hashmonah. The next stop mentioned after Hashmonah is Moseroth. 

Some Bible scholars attempt to identify Hashmonah with Azmon, a place mentioned in Numbers 34:4 as part of the southern border of the Promised Land. However, this identification is uncertain and not universally accepted. 

The mention of Hashmonah in the itinerary of Israel's wilderness journey serves to emphasize God's guidance and provision for His people during their 40-year sojourn in the desert. It also highlights the importance of remembering and recording the various stages of their journey as a testimony to future generations of God's faithfulness and leadership. 

As with many of the places mentioned in the wilderness itinerary, Hashmonah's significance lies primarily in its role as a marker in Israel's divinely-led journey from slavery in Egypt to the Promised Land. Its inclusion in the biblical record underscores the historical and theological importance of this formative period in Israel's history.
