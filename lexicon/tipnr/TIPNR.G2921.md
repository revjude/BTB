- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[2Tim.4.10|Act.18.8]]; 
- only referred to as Crispus **<big>[[G2921|Κρίσπος]]</big>**.

Crispus was the ruler of the synagogue in Corinth during Paul's ministry there. According to Acts 18:8, Crispus believed in the Lord, along with his entire household, after hearing Paul's preaching. This conversion was significant, as Crispus held a prominent position in the Jewish community. 

Following his conversion, Crispus was baptized by Paul, as mentioned in [[1Cor.1.14|1 Corinthians 1:14]]. Paul specifically notes that he personally baptized Crispus, along with Gaius, emphasizing the importance of their conversions. The fact that Paul baptized Crispus himself underscores the significance of this synagogue leader coming to faith in Christ. 

Crispus' conversion likely had a considerable impact on the Jewish community in Corinth and may have encouraged other Jews and Gentiles to consider Paul's message more closely. His story demonstrates the power of the gospel to transform lives, even among those in positions of religious authority.
