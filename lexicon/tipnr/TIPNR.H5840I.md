Azrikam was a Levite who lived in Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah, after the return from Babylonian exile. He is mentioned in two parallel lists of the inhabitants of Jerusalem found in [[1Chr.9.14|1 Chronicles 9:14]] and [[Neh.11.15|Nehemiah 11:15]]. In both passages, Azrikam is identified as a Levite and a descendant of Hashabiah. The Levites were responsible for assisting the priests in the temple services. Azrikam's presence in Jerusalem suggests he may have had duties related to the temple worship that was being reestablished at that time.
