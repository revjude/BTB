Arpad was an ancient city located in northern Syria, near the modern city of Aleppo. It is mentioned in the Bible as one of the cities conquered by the Assyrian Empire \([[2Kgs.18.34|2 Kings 18:34]], 19:13; [[Isa.10.9|Isaiah 10:9]], 36:19, 37:13; [[Jer.49.23|Jeremiah 49:23]]\). The Assyrian kings Tiglath-pileser III and Sargon II both record capturing Arpad in their inscriptions. Arpad's fall was used as an example to threaten Judah and other nations, showing the power of Assyria and the inability of the gods of the conquered peoples to save them. The Bible does not provide any details about Arpad's history, culture, or religious practices apart from its subjugation by Assyria.
