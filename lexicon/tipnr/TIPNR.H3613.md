<small>*Place associated with Hezron's death*</small>

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Caleb Ephrathah</span> was the place where Hezron, the son of Perez, died.
- A location only mentioned at [[1Chr.2.24|1Ch.2.24]]; 
- only referred to as Caleb\_Ephrathah<[[H3613]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>כ</span>ָּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>ֵ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span> <span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>ֶ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>פ</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ת</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>\).

Caleb Ephrathah is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.2.24|1 Chronicles 2:24]] as the place where Hezron, the son of Perez and grandson of Judah, died. The verse states that after Hezron's death in Caleb Ephrathah, his wife Abijah bore him a son named Ashhur, who became the father of Tekoa. 

The exact location and significance of Caleb Ephrathah are unclear from this single reference. Some scholars suggest that it may refer to a region or a town associated with the descendants of Caleb, the faithful spy who was rewarded with a portion of the Promised Land \(Numbers 14:24; Joshua 14:13-14\). The name Ephrathah is also associated with Bethlehem, the birthplace of David \(Ruth 4:11; Micah 5:2\). 

However, the meaning of the verse may be different, so that Caleb and Ephrathah are names of people.
