Barak was an Israelite commander from the tribe of Naphtali who played a significant role in the victory over the Canaanite forces led by Sisera \(Judges 4\). Deborah, a prophetess and judge of Israel, summoned Barak and instructed him to gather troops from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun to fight against Sisera's army. Barak agreed to go only if Deborah accompanied him, to which she consented but prophesied that the honor of the victory would go to a woman. Barak led the Israelite forces to Mount Tabor, where they decisively defeated Sisera's army. The victory was celebrated in the Song of Deborah and Barak \(Judges 5\), which praises their leadership and God's deliverance. Barak is later mentioned in [[1Sam.12.11|1 Samuel 12:11]] as one of the deliverers sent by God to save Israel from their enemies. The New Testament also commends Barak's faith in [[Heb.11.32|Hebrews 11:32]], listing him among the examples of those who through faith conquered kingdoms and administered justice.
