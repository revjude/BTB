- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.6.18|Neh.6.18]]; 
- only referred to as Shecaniah **<big>[[H7935|שְׁכַנְיָה]]</big>**; 
- a son of Arah **<big>[[H0733|אָרַח]]</big>**.

Shecaniah is mentioned in [[Neh.6.18|Nehemiah 6:18]] as the father-in-law of Tobiah the Ammonite, who opposed Nehemiah's efforts to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. Shecaniah's daughter was married to Tobiah, giving Tobiah a connection to some of the nobles of Judah. This family tie may have helped Tobiah gain influence to undermine Nehemiah's work.
