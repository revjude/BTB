- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.48|Ezr.2.48]]; 
- only referred to as Nekoda **<big>[[H5353|נְקוֹדָא]]</big>**.

Nekoda is mentioned in [[Ezra.2.48|Ezra 2:48]] and [[Neh.7.50|Nehemiah 7:50]] as one of the families of temple servants \(also known as Nethinim\) who returned to Jerusalem from Babylonian exile. The temple servants were a group of individuals who assisted the Levites in the maintenance and operation of the temple. 

According to the lists of returnees in both Ezra and Nehemiah, the descendants of Nekoda were among those who journeyed back to Jerusalem under the leadership of Zerubbabel, following the decree of King Cyrus of Persia, which allowed the Jews to return to their homeland and rebuild the temple \(Ezra 1:1-4\).
