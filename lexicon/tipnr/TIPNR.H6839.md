Zophim, meaning "watchmen" or "lookout," was a field on the top of Pisgah in Moab \([[Num.23.14|Num.23.14]]\). It was one of the locations where Balak took Balaam to view the Israelites and curse them. However, instead of cursing Israel, Balaam blessed them according to the word of the Lord. The exact location of Zophim is uncertain, but it was likely a high point or lookout spot on the Pisgah range, east of the Dead Sea, from which one could view the Israelite camp.
