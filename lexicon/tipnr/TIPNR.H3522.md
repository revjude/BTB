Cabbon was a town located in the Shephelah, or lowlands, of Judah \([[Josh.15.40|Joshua 15:40]]\). It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the list of towns allotted to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land under Joshua. No other details are provided about Cabbon's history, size, or significance. Its exact location is unknown, but it was likely situated in the western foothills of Judah, near the border with the coastal plain.
