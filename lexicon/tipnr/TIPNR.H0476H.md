Elishama was one of the sons of King David born to him in Jerusalem \([[2Sam.5.16|2Sa.5.16]]; [[1Chr.3.8|1Ch.3.8]]; 14.7\). He was born after David had established himself as king over Israel and had conquered the city of Jerusalem. Elishama is consistently listed among David's sons born in Jerusalem, confirming his place in the royal family. However, the Bible does not provide any additional information about Elishama's life, role, or significance in the kingdom of Israel.
