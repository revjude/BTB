Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Judas</span>, also known as Barsabbas, was a prophet and respected leader in the Jerusalem church who accompanied Paul and Barnabas to Antioch.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Gal.2.14|Act.15.22]]; 
- referred to as Judas<[[G2455M]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ἰούδας</span>\), or Barsabbas \(KJV= Barsabas\) <[[G0923H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Βαρσαβᾶς</span>\).

Judas, also known as Barsabbas, is mentioned in Acts 15:22, 27, 32 as a prophet and leader in the Jerusalem church. The context of the passage is the Jerusalem Council, where the early church leaders discussed and resolved the issue of Gentile believers and the Mosaic law \(Acts 15:1-35\). 

After the council reached a decision, they chose Judas Barsabbas and Silas, both described as leading men among the believers, to accompany Paul and Barnabas back to Antioch \(Acts 15:22\). They carried a letter from the Jerusalem church, confirming the council's decision and encouraging the Gentile believers \(Acts 15:23-29\). 

In Antioch, Judas and Silas, being prophets, exhorted and strengthened the believers with many words \(Acts 15:32\). This indicates that they had a recognized ministry of prophecy and encouragement within the early church. 

After spending some time in Antioch, Judas and Silas were sent back to Jerusalem with the blessing of peace from the church \(Acts 15:33\). No further details are provided about Judas Barsabbas' life or ministry beyond this event. 

The inclusion of Judas Barsabbas in this narrative highlights the unity and cooperation among the early church leaders, as well as the importance of prophecy and encouragement in the growth and strengthening of the believers.
