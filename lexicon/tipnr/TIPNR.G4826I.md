- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Luke.3.30|Act.13.1]]; 
- referred to as Simeon **<big>[[G4826|Συμεών]]</big>**, or Niger **<big>[[G3526|Νίγερ]]</big>**.

Simeon, also known as Niger, is mentioned in Acts 13:1 as one of the prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch. He is listed alongside Barnabas, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen \(who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch\), and Saul \(later known as Paul\). The fact that Simeon was called Niger suggests that he may have had a dark complexion or come from a region in Africa. As a prophet and teacher, Simeon would have been involved in proclaiming God's word and instructing the believers in Antioch. It was during a time of worship and fasting that the Holy Spirit called Barnabas and Saul to be set apart for the work of spreading the gospel to the Gentiles. Simeon, along with the other leaders, laid their hands on Barnabas and Saul and sent them off on their first missionary journey, which marked a significant expansion of the early Christian church.
