- A king of Bashan living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Num.21.33|Num.21.33]]; 
- only referred to as Og **<big>[[H5747|עוֹג]]</big>**.

Og was the Amorite king of Bashan during the time of the Israelites' journey from Egypt to the Promised Land \([[Num.21.33|Numbers 21:33]]; Deuteronomy 3:1\). He ruled over the region of Bashan, which was known for its fertile land and fortified cities \(Deuteronomy 3:4-5\). Og and his army confronted the Israelites, but God delivered him into the hands of Moses and the Israelites \(Numbers 21:34; Deuteronomy 3:3\). The Israelites defeated Og, conquered his territory, and allocated it to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half of Manasseh \([[Num.32.33|Numbers 32:33]]; Deuteronomy 3:12-13; [[Josh.13.30|Joshua 13:30]]-31\). Og was renowned for his great size, and his iron bedstead was mentioned as a symbol of his stature \(Deuteronomy 3:11\). The defeat of Og was remembered as a significant victory for the Israelites and a testament to God's power and faithfulness \(Deuteronomy 31:4; [[Josh.2.10|Joshua 2:10]]; 9:10; Psalm 135:11; 136:20\).
