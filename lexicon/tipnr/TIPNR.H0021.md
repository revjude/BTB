Abi, also called Abijah, was the mother of King Hezekiah of Judah. She is mentioned in [[2Kgs.18.2|2 Kings 18:2]] and [[2Chr.29.1|2 Chronicles 29:1]] as the daughter of Zechariah. Hezekiah, who reigned from approximately 715-686 BC, was known for his religious reforms and his trust in God \(2 Kings 18:5-6\). The fact that Abi is mentioned by name suggests that she may have had a positive influence on her son Hezekiah. However, no further details about her life or character are provided in the Bible.
