- A man from the tribe of Judah living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.3.24|1Ch.3.24]]; 
- only referred to as Delaiah **<big>[[H1806|דְּלָיָה]]</big>**; 
-  son of Elioenai **<big>[[H0454|אֶלְיְהוֹעֵינַי]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Hodaviah **<big>[[H1938|הוֹדַוְיָה]]</big>**, Eliashib **<big>[[H0475|אֶלְיָשִׁיב]]</big>**, Pelaiah **<big>[[H6411|פְּלָיָה]]</big>**, Akkub **<big>[[H6126|עַקּוּב]]</big>**, Johanan **<big>[[H3110|יוֹחָנָן]]</big>** and Anani **<big>[[H6054|עֲנָנִי]]</big>**.

Delaiah is mentioned in [[1Chr.3.24|1 Chronicles 3:24]] as part of the genealogy of David's descendants, particularly those who came after Jeconiah \(also known as Jehoiachin\), the king of Judah who was exiled to Babylon. Delaiah is listed as one of the sons of Elioenai, who was a descendant of Jeconiah through Shealtiel and Zerubbabel. 

The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 3 traces the royal line of David, focusing on the kings of Judah and their descendants. The inclusion of Delaiah and his family members in this genealogy indicates that they were part of the royal lineage, even after the exile to Babylon. 

The mention of Delaiah and his brothers \(Hizkiah, Akkub, Johanan, Dalaiah, and Anani\) several generations after Zerubbabel suggests that the descendants of David continued to be recognized and recorded even after the return from exile and the end of the monarchy. 

Apart from this genealogical reference, no other details are provided about Delaiah's life or specific role. His inclusion in the genealogy serves to demonstrate the continuation of David's lineage and the fulfillment of God's promise to establish David's throne forever \(2 Samuel 7:16\).
