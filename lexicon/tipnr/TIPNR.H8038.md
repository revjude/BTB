- A Canaanite king living at the time of the Patriarchs, only mentioned at [[Gen.14.2|Gen.14.2]]; 
- only referred to as Shemeber **<big>[[H8038|שֶׁמְאֵבֶר]]</big>**.

Shemeber was the king of Zeboiim, one of the five cities of the plain, during the time of Abraham. According to [[Gen.14.2|Genesis 14:2]], Shemeber allied himself with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and the king of Bela \(Zoar\) to engage in battle against Chedorlaomer king of Elam and his confederate kings. The battle, known as the Battle of the Valley of Siddim, resulted in the defeat of the kings of the plain and the capture of Lot, Abraham's nephew. This event prompted Abraham to mount a rescue mission, ultimately leading to the recovery of Lot and his possessions.
