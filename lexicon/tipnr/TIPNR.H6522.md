The Perizzites were one of the Canaanite people groups that inhabited the land of Canaan before the Israelite conquest. They are first mentioned in [[Gen.13.7|Genesis 13:7]] as living in the land alongside the Canaanites during the time of Abraham. God promised to give the land of the Perizzites to Abraham's descendants \([[Gen.15.20|Genesis 15:20]]\). The Perizzites are often listed among the Canaanite nations that the Israelites were to dispossess and drive out \([[Exod.3.8|Exodus 3:8]],17; 23:23; 33:2; 34:11; Deuteronomy 7:1; 20:17; [[Josh.3.10|Joshua 3:10]]; 9:1; 11:3; 12:8\). During the conquest of Canaan, the Perizzites were among the groups defeated by the Israelites \([[Josh.24.11|Joshua 24:11]]; [[Judg.1.4|Judges 1:4]]-5\). However, some Perizzites remained in the land, and the Israelites intermarried with them \([[Judg.3.5|Judges 3:5]]-6\). The Perizzites, along with other Canaanite groups, were subjected to forced labor during the reigns of Solomon and later kings \([[1Kgs.9.20|1 Kings 9:20]]-21; [[2Chr.8.7|2 Chronicles 8:7]]-8\). Remnants of the Perizzites were still present in the land after the Babylonian exile \([[Ezra.9.1|Ezra 9:1]]; [[Neh.9.8|Nehemiah 9:8]]\).
