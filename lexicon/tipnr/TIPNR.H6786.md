The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Zemarites</span> were a Canaanite people group mentioned in the Table of Nations \([[Gen.10.18|Gen.10.18]]; [[1Chr.1.16|1Ch.1.16]]\).
- People from Zemar\(?\) of the Canaanites, first mentioned at [[Gen.10.18|Gen.10.18]]; 
- only referred to as Zemarites<[[H6786]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>צ</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>מ</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>\); 
- descended from Canaan<[[H3667G]]> along with Sidon<[[H6721G]]>, Heth<[[H2845]]>, Jebusites<[[H2983G]]>, Amorites<[[H0567]]>, Girgashites<[[H1622]]>, Hivites<[[H2340]]>, Arkites<[[H6208]]>, Sinites<[[H5513]]>, Arvadites<[[H0721]]> and Hamathites<[[H2577]]>.

The Zemarites were a Canaanite people group mentioned in the Table of Nations in Genesis 10 and 1 Chronicles 1. They are listed between the Arvadites and Hamathites, suggesting they lived in the northern region of Phoenicia. The name may be associated with the town of Sumra, located on the coast between Tripolis and Arvad, about 1.5 miles north of the Nahr el-Kebir River. This town is likely the same as Cumur, which is mentioned in the Tell el-Amarna Letters along with Arvad. The exact extent and history of the Zemarites is unknown, as they are only mentioned in these genealogical passages.
