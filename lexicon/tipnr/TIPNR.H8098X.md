Shemaiah was a prophet from Kiriath-jearim who lived during the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah. According to [[Jer.26.20|Jeremiah 26:20]], Shemaiah prophesied against Jerusalem and the land of Judah, speaking words similar to those of Jeremiah. However, when King Jehoiakim and the officials heard his words, they sought to put him to death. Fearing for his life, Shemaiah fled to Egypt. This incident is mentioned in the context of Jeremiah's own persecution for his prophetic messages, highlighting the dangers faced by prophets who spoke out against the prevailing powers and attitudes of their time.
