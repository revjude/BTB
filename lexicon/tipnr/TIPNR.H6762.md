Zela was a city located in the territory allotted to the tribe of Benjamin \([[Josh.18.28|Jos.18.28]]\). It is mentioned as part of a group of fourteen cities north of Jerusalem, though its exact location is uncertain. Some suggest it may be identified with Khirbet Salah between Jerusalem and Gibeon. Notably, Zela contained the ancestral tomb of Kish, the father of King Saul. After Saul and his sons were killed by the Philistines, David had their bones buried in this tomb at Zela \([[2Sam.21.14|2Sa.21.14]]\). The name Zela in Hebrew may mean "rib" or "side" as of a hill. Zela is possibly the same as Zilu mentioned in the Tell el-Amarna Letters.
