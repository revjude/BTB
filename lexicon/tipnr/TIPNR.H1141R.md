Benaiah is mentioned in [[Ezek.11.1|Ezekiel 11:1]] and 13 as the father of Pelatiah, one of the twenty-five wicked princes of Israel who opposed the prophet Ezekiel's message. The context of the passage is Ezekiel's vision of the idolatry and wickedness in Jerusalem, which prompted God's judgment on the city. Pelatiah and the other princes are described as giving evil advice and plotting violence, disregarding the warnings of the prophets. As Ezekiel prophesied against them, Pelatiah suddenly died, serving as a sign of the impending judgment on the city and its leaders. Benaiah's mention as Pelatiah's father highlights the family connection and the fact that wickedness and opposition to God's message were present even among the leadership of Israel.
