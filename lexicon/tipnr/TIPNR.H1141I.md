- A man from the tribe of Simeon\(?\) living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.4.36|1Ch.4.36]]; 
- only referred to as Benaiah **<big>[[H1141|בְּנָיָה]]</big>**.

Benaiah is mentioned in [[1Chr.4.36|1 Chronicles 4:36]] as one of the leaders of the tribe of Simeon during the reign of King Hezekiah. The context of the passage is the genealogy of the Simeonites and their territorial expansion. Benaiah, along with other Simeonite leaders, led an attack against the Hamites and Meunites who were dwelling in the region. They successfully destroyed their settlements and took possession of their lands, as the Hamites and Meunites had been divinely punished for their wickedness. This event demonstrates the Simeonites' military prowess and their obedience to God's will in cleansing the land of evil influences.
