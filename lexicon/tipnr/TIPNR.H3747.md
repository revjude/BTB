The Brook Cherith is mentioned in the story of the prophet Elijah during the reign of King Ahab of Israel \([[1Kgs.17.3|1 Kings 17:3]]-5\). After Elijah declared a drought in the land as a judgment from God, the Lord instructed him to hide by the Brook Cherith, east of the Jordan River. God promised to provide for Elijah there, using ravens to bring him bread and meat in the morning and evening, and the brook as his source of water. 

Elijah obeyed and stayed by the Brook Cherith until it dried up due to the prolonged drought. The exact location of the brook is uncertain, but it was likely one of the many wadis or seasonal streams that flowed into the Jordan River from the mountains of Gilead. 

This event demonstrates God's faithfulness in providing for His servant during a time of hardship and judgment. It also highlights Elijah's obedience and trust in God's direction and provision. The Brook Cherith served as a place of refuge and sustenance for Elijah, preparing him for his subsequent confrontations with Ahab and the prophets of Baal.
