Baruch, son of Neriah, was the faithful scribe and companion of the prophet Jeremiah. He played a significant role in recording and delivering Jeremiah's prophecies to the people of Judah. In Jeremiah 36, Baruch wrote down Jeremiah's words on a scroll and read them in the temple, as the prophet was restricted from going there himself. When King Jehoiakim destroyed the scroll, Baruch rewrote the prophecies with additional messages from Jeremiah. Baruch also served as a witness to Jeremiah's purchase of a field, symbolizing God's promise of future restoration \([[Jer.32.12|Jeremiah 32:12]]-16\). He accompanied Jeremiah to Egypt after the fall of Jerusalem, despite the prophet's warnings \([[Jer.43.3|Jeremiah 43:3]]-6\). In Jeremiah 45, God spoke directly to Baruch, reassuring him of divine protection amidst the impending judgment on Judah. Baruch's unwavering support for Jeremiah, even in the face of opposition and personal risk, demonstrates his commitment to God's message and his loyalty to the prophet.
