Man living at the time of the Patriarchs

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Shelah</span>, son of Arpachshad and ancestor of Abraham in Luke's genealogy.
- A man living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at Gen.10.24; 
- referred to as Shelah<[[H7974]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ש</span>ֶׁ֫<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ח</span>\), or Shelah \(KJV= Sala\) <[[G4527H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Σαλά</span>\); 
- a son of Cainan<[[G2536G]]>; 
-  father of Eber<[[H5677G]]>.

Shelah was the son of Arpachshad \(or Arphaxad\) and the grandson of Shem, according to Genesis 10:24 and 11:12. He was born when Arpachshad was 35 years old and lived for 433 years \([[Gen.11.12|Genesis 11:12]]-15\). Shelah was an ancestor of Abraham and is included in the genealogies of Genesis 10, 11, and 1 Chronicles 1. 

In Luke's genealogy of Jesus, Shelah is mentioned as the son of Cainan, who was the son of Arpachshad \([[Luke.3.35|Luke 3:35]]-36\). This differs from the Old Testament genealogies, which list Shelah as the son of Arpachshad. The reason for this discrepancy is uncertain, but it may reflect variant traditions or textual issues.
