The Garmites are mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.4.19|1 Chronicles 4:19]] as living in Keilah, possibly descendants of Gerem, who was from the tribe of Judah. The passage lists several families and clans within the tribe of Judah, including the sons of Hodiah's wife, the sister of Naham. One of these sons is identified as the father of Keilah the Garmite. This suggests that the Garmites were a family or clan within the tribe of Judah, associated with the city of Keilah. However, no further information is provided about the Garmites, their history, or their role within the tribe. The brief mention of the Garmites in the genealogical record of Judah highlights the complexity and diversity of the Israelite tribal system and the importance of family and clan affiliations in ancient Israelite society.
