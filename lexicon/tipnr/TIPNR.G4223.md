Puteoli, modern-day Pozzuoli, was an important port city located on the Bay of Naples in Italy. It is mentioned in the New Testament in connection with Paul's journey to Rome as a prisoner \(Acts 28:13\). After sailing from Malta, where they had been shipwrecked, Paul and his companions arrived at Syracuse and then proceeded to Rhegium. From there, they sailed to Puteoli, where they found some Christian brothers and stayed with them for seven days \(Acts 28:13-14\). Puteoli was a significant harbor and commercial center, serving as a gateway to Rome. It was also a major hub for the grain trade from Egypt, which was vital for supplying food to the populous city of Rome. The presence of a Christian community in Puteoli indicates the spread of the gospel in Italy, even before Paul's arrival in Rome. Paul's stay in Puteoli for a week suggests that he had the opportunity to fellowship with and encourage the local believers before continuing his journey to Rome, where he would await trial before Caesar.
