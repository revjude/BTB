Abihail is mentioned in the book of Esther as the father of Esther, also known as Hadassah \([[Esth.2.15|Esther 2:15]]\). Esther was a young Jewish woman living in Persia during the reign of King Ahasuerus \(Xerxes I\). After Queen Vashti was deposed, Esther was chosen to become the new queen. 

When Haman, a high-ranking official in the Persian court, plotted to destroy the Jewish people, Esther courageously intervened and saved her people. She revealed her Jewish identity to the king and exposed Haman's evil plan. As a result, Haman was executed, and the Jewish people were allowed to defend themselves against their enemies. 

Esther, along with her cousin and guardian Mordecai, wrote a letter to confirm the practices of Purim, a Jewish holiday commemorating the deliverance of the Jews from Haman's plot \([[Esth.9.29|Esther 9:29]]\). In this letter, Esther is referred to as "Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail."
