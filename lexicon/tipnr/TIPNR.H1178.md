Baal-hazor is mentioned in [[2Sam.13.23|2 Samuel 13:23]] as the location where Absalom, King David's son, had his sheepshearers. Absalom invited all the king's sons to join him at Baal-hazor for a feast. It was during this gathering that Absalom orchestrated the murder of his half-brother Amnon in revenge for Amnon's rape of Absalom's sister Tamar. The exact location of Baal-hazor is not specified, but it was likely situated near Ephraim, as the verse mentions that it was "beside Ephraim."
