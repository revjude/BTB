The Besor is a brook mentioned in 1 Samuel 30 in connection with David's pursuit of the Amalekites. After the Amalekites had raided Ziklag and taken captive the families of David and his men, David sought the Lord's guidance and was directed to pursue the raiders. As they came to the Brook Besor, two hundred of David's men were too exhausted to continue the pursuit and remained behind \([[1Sam.30.9|1 Samuel 30:9]]-10\). David and the remaining four hundred men crossed the brook and eventually overtook the Amalekites, defeating them and recovering all that had been taken, including their families. On their return, they met the two hundred men who had stayed at the Brook Besor, and David insisted that they share equally in the spoils of victory \([[1Sam.30.21|1 Samuel 30:21]]-25\). The exact location of the Brook Besor is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in the Negev region, south of Ziklag. The brook played a significant role in David's successful pursuit and defeat of the Amalekites.
