Elnathan is mentioned as the father of Nehushta, who was the mother of King Jehoiachin of Judah \([[2Kgs.24.8|2Ki.24.8]]\). Jehoiachin, also known as Jeconiah, was a king of Judah who reigned for a brief period of three months before being deposed by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II. Elnathan's mention in this context provides insight into the family background of Jehoiachin and his mother. As the father of a queen mother, Elnathan likely held a position of influence and prominence in the royal court. However, the Bible does not provide any additional information about Elnathan's life, his role in the kingdom, or his relationship with his daughter and grandson. His inclusion in the text serves primarily to establish the genealogical connection between Jehoiachin and his mother, Nehushta.
