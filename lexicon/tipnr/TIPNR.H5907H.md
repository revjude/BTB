Achbor, also referred to as Abdon, was an official who served during the reign of King Josiah of Judah \(640-609 BC\). He was the son of Micaiah and the father of Elnathan \([[2Kgs.22.12|2 Kings 22:12]]; [[Jer.36.12|Jeremiah 36:12]]\). 

During the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign, when the Book of the Law was discovered in the temple, Achbor was one of the officials sent by the king to inquire of the Lord concerning the words of the book \([[2Kgs.22.12|2 Kings 22:12]]-14; [[2Chr.34.20|2 Chronicles 34:20]]\). Along with other officials, Achbor went to the prophetess Huldah, who delivered a message from God confirming the authenticity of the book and the impending judgment on Judah for their disobedience \(2 Kings 22:15-20; 2 Chronicles 34:22-28\). 

Achbor's son Elnathan is mentioned as one of the officials who urged King Jehoiakim not to burn the scroll containing the prophecies of Jeremiah \([[Jer.36.12|Jeremiah 36:12]],25\). Elnathan was also involved in bringing the prophet Uriah back from Egypt to face Jehoiakim's judgment \([[Jer.26.22|Jeremiah 26:22]]\). 

Achbor's involvement in the discovery of the Book of the Law and his consultation with the prophetess Huldah highlight his role in the religious reforms initiated by King Josiah, which sought to restore proper worship and obedience to God's commandments in Judah.
