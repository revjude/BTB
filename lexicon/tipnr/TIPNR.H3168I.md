God revealed to Ezekiel that his wife would die suddenly, and he was commanded not to mourn for her openly. Ezekiel's wife died that evening, and the next morning, Ezekiel did as the Lord had commanded him. God used this event as a sign to the people of Israel, indicating that they should not mourn when the Lord's judgment came upon Jerusalem and the temple. The death of Ezekiel's wife served as a powerful object lesson, demonstrating the severity of God's impending judgment and the importance of submitting to His will.
