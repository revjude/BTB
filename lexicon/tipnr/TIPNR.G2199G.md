Zebedee was a fisherman from Galilee and the father of two of Jesus' disciples, James and John. He worked alongside his sons in the fishing business and was present when Jesus called them to follow Him. Zebedee's wife, the mother of James and John, is mentioned as one of the women who followed Jesus and supported His ministry. She also made a bold request for her sons to sit at Jesus' right and left hand in His kingdom, revealing her high aspirations for them. Zebedee is not mentioned as a follower of Jesus himself, but he did not hinder his sons from leaving their fishing trade to become disciples. The fact that Zebedee had hired servants suggests that he ran a successful fishing operation. His sons, James and John, along with Peter, formed Jesus' inner circle of disciples and were present at significant events such as the Transfiguration and Jesus' prayers in Gethsemane.
