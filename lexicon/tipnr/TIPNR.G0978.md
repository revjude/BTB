Bithynia was a region located in the northern part of Asia Minor, bordering the Black Sea. In Acts 16:7, Paul and his companions attempted to enter Bithynia during his second missionary journey, but the Holy Spirit prevented them from doing so. The region is also mentioned in [[1Pet.1.1|1 Peter 1:1]] as one of the areas where the recipients of Peter's letter, the "elect exiles," were scattered. Bithynia was known for its fertile land and was a significant province in the Roman Empire.
