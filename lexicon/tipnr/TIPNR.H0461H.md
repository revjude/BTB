Eliezer was the second son of Moses and Zipporah \([[Exod.18.4|Exo.18.4]]\). His name, which means "my God is help," was given by Moses because God had delivered him from Pharaoh's sword \([[Exod.18.4|Exo.18.4]]\). Eliezer and his brother Gershom were born during Moses' exile in Midian. In the genealogies of the Levites, Eliezer is listed as a son of Moses \([[1Chr.23.15|1Ch.23.15]],17\). He had a son named Rehabiah, who had many descendants \(1Ch.23.17; 26.25\). The Bible does not provide any further details about Eliezer's life or role.
