Ephraim was one of the two sons of Joseph, who received a double portion of inheritance among the tribes of Israel. No further details about Bered's life or role are provided in the biblical text. His inclusion in the genealogy highlights the importance of family lineage and the preservation of ancestral records among the Israelites, particularly within the tribe of Ephraim, which would later play a significant role in the northern kingdom of Israel.
