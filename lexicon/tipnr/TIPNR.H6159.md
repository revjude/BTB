Oreb was a prince of Midian who, along with another prince named Zeeb, led the Midianite army against Israel during the time of Gideon \(Judges 7:25\). After Gideon and his 300 men defeated the Midianites, the Ephraimites captured and killed Oreb and Zeeb \(Judges 7:25; 8:3\). The Ephraimites brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon as a trophy of their victory \(Judges 7:25\). The rock where Oreb was killed became known as the "rock of Oreb" \(Judges 7:25\). The defeat of Oreb and Zeeb was a significant victory for Israel and a testament to God's power and deliverance \(Psalm 83:11\). The prophet Isaiah later used the "rock of Oreb" as a symbol of God's judgment against the Assyrians \([[Isa.10.26|Isaiah 10:26]]\).
