Eliab, a member of the tribe of Reuben, is mentioned in [[Num.16.1|Numbers 16:1]],12; 26:8,9; and Deuteronomy 11:6 as the father of Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram, along with Korah, led a rebellion against the leadership of Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. They challenged the authority of Moses and Aaron, claiming that all the congregation was holy \([[Num.16.1|Numbers 16:1]]-3\). Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, but they refused to appear before him \([[Num.16.1|Numbers 16:1]]2-14\). As a result, God caused the earth to open up and swallow the rebels and their households \(Numbers 16:31-33\). Eliab's sons, Dathan and Abiram, perished in this divine judgment \([[Num.26.9|Numbers 26:9]]; Deuteronomy 11:6\). The rebellion of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram serves as a warning against challenging God's appointed leaders.
