Hur is mentioned in [[1Kgs.4.8|1 Kings 4:8]] as one of the twelve district governors appointed by King Solomon during his reign over Israel. Each governor was responsible for providing food for the royal household for one month out of the year. 

The twelve districts were strategically located throughout the kingdom of Israel, ensuring a steady supply of provisions for the king's court. Hur's specific district is not mentioned in the text. 

The appointment of district governors was part of Solomon's administrative strategy to organize and manage the resources of his kingdom effectively. By dividing the land into twelve districts and appointing governors over each one, Solomon was able to ensure that the needs of his royal household were met and that the resources of the land were efficiently utilized. 

The fact that Hur is mentioned by name suggests that he was a person of some importance or influence, as he was entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing a district and providing for the king's needs. 

Apart from this brief mention in [[1Kgs.4.8|1 Kings 4:8]], no other information is provided about Hur in the Bible. His role as a district governor under Solomon highlights the king's organizational skills and the structure of the Israelite kingdom during this period of peace and prosperity.
