Jonathan, the son of Kareah, is mentioned in [[Jer.40.8|Jeremiah 40:8]] as one of the army officers who came to Gedaliah at Mizpah after the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in 586 BC. Gedaliah had been appointed by the Babylonians as governor over the towns of Judah \(Jeremiah 40:5\). After the Babylonians departed, Gedaliah encouraged the remaining people in the land to serve the king of Babylon and settle in the land \(Jeremiah 40:9-10\). Jonathan, along with other officers and their men, came to Gedaliah at Mizpah and were assured by him of safety as long as they remained submitted to Babylonian rule.
