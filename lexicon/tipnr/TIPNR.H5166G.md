Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Nehemiah</span> was among the leaders who returned with Zerubbabel from Babylonian exile to Jerusalem.
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.2|Ezr.2.2]]; 
- only referred to as Nehemiah **<big>[[H5166|נְחֶמְיָה]]</big>**.

Nehemiah is mentioned in [[Ezra.2.2|Ezra 2:2]] and [[Neh.7.7|Nehemiah 7:7]] as one of the leaders who returned to Jerusalem from Babylonian captivity along with Zerubbabel. This event took place around 538 BC, when the Persian king Cyrus issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to their homeland and rebuild the temple in Jerusalem \(Ezra 1:1-4\). 

The list of returnees in both Ezra and Nehemiah highlights the importance of these leaders in the resettlement of Jerusalem and the restoration of Jewish religious and social life. As a prominent figure among the returnees, Nehemiah would have played a significant role in the challenges and efforts of reestablishing the Jewish community in their ancestral land. 

However, it is important to note that this Nehemiah is not the same person as the Nehemiah who later served as the governor of Judah and rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem, whose story is recounted in the book bearing his name. The Nehemiah mentioned in [[Ezra.2.2|Ezra 2:2]] and [[Neh.7.7|Nehemiah 7:7]] was a contemporary of Zerubbabel, while the Nehemiah of the book of Nehemiah lived several decades later, during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia.
