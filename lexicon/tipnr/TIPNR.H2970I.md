- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezek.11.1|Ezk.11.1]]; 
- only referred to as Jaazaniah **<big>[[H2970|יַאֲזַנְיָה]]</big>**; 
- a son of Azzur **<big>[[H5809|עַזּוּר]]</big>**.

Jaazaniah, the son of Azzur, is mentioned in [[Ezek.11.1|Ezekiel 11:1]] as one of the twenty-five men who appeared in Ezekiel's vision at the entrance of the east gate of the Lord's house. Along with Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, Jaazaniah is described as a leader among these men. 

In the vision, God identifies these men as those who were devising iniquity and giving wicked counsel in the city \(Ezk.11.2\). They were encouraging the people to build houses and promising them safety, despite the impending judgment that God had revealed to Ezekiel \(Ezk.11.3\). 

As a leader, Jaazaniah would have had significant influence over the people, but he used his position to lead them astray and promote false security. God condemns their actions and declares that He will bring judgment upon them and the city \(Ezk.11.7-12\). 

Jaazaniah's presence in this vision highlights the corruption and wickedness of Jerusalem's leaders, who were leading the people away from God and toward destruction. It also demonstrates the severity of God's judgment against those who persist in sin and reject His warnings.
