Zerahiah, also known as Ahitub, was a priest mentioned in the genealogies of the priestly families in 1 Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah. He was an ancestor of Ezra the scribe, who played a significant role in the spiritual reformation of the Jews after their return from Babylonian exile. In the genealogies, Zerahiah is listed as the son of Uzzi and the father of Meraioth. He was part of the line of priests descending from Eleazar, the son of Aaron. As a priest, Zerahiah would have served in the temple and carried out the religious duties prescribed for the Levitical priesthood. His inclusion in the genealogies of Ezra emphasizes the scribe's priestly lineage and authority.
