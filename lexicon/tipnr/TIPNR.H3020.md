Jogli, the son of Bukki, is mentioned in [[Num.34.22|Numbers 34:22]] as one of the leaders appointed to help divide the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel. He was chosen as the representative from the tribe of Dan. This appointment took place near the end of the Israelites' wilderness wanderings, as they prepared to enter and possess the land of Canaan. Jogli's selection as a leader indicates his importance and respect within his tribe. Along with leaders from the other tribes, he was entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing the fair distribution of the land, ensuring that each tribe received its allotted portion as decreed by God. This division of the land was a significant moment in Israel's history, marking the fulfillment of God's promise to give them a homeland.
