The Girgashites were a Canaanite people group mentioned several times in the Old Testament. They are first listed in [[Gen.10.16|Genesis 10:16]] and [[1Chr.1.14|1 Chronicles 1:14]] as descendants of Canaan, the son of Ham. In God's covenant with Abraham, the Girgashites are named as one of the groups inhabiting the land that would be given to Abraham's descendants \([[Gen.15.21|Genesis 15:21]]\). When the Israelites entered the Promised Land, the Girgashites were among the peoples they were instructed to dispossess \(Deuteronomy 7:1; [[Josh.3.10|Joshua 3:10]]\). The Girgashites are mentioned again in [[Josh.24.11|Joshua 24:11]] and [[Neh.9.8|Nehemiah 9:8]], recounting God's faithfulness in giving the land to Israel as promised. The Bible does not provide any details about their culture, religion, or exact location within Canaan.
