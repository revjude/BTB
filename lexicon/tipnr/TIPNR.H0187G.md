Uzal was one of the sons of Joktan, a descendant of Shem. He is mentioned in the genealogy of Shem's descendants, which traces the lineage of the Semitic peoples. Uzal and his brothers were said to have settled in the region "from Mesha toward Sephar, in the eastern hill country." Uzal likely settled and gave his name to an area in ancient Yemen, as the ancient name for the Yemeni city of Sanaa was also Uzal.
