Gallim is mentioned in the Bible as a town located in the tribal territory of Benjamin. It is referenced in two separate contexts in the Old Testament. 

In [[1Sam.25.44|1 Samuel 25:44]], Gallim is identified as the hometown of Paltiel, the man to whom King Saul gave his daughter Michal in marriage after she had previously been married to David. This event occurred during the time when David was fleeing from Saul's pursuit and Saul had given Michal to Paltiel as a political move to strengthen his own position. 

Later, in [[Isa.10.30|Isaiah 10:30]], Gallim is mentioned in a prophetic passage describing the advance of the Assyrian army toward Jerusalem. In this context, the town is personified as a daughter who is called to cry out, along with other nearby towns, in the face of the impending invasion. 

The exact location of Gallim is not specified in the Bible, but it is believed to have been situated north of Jerusalem, possibly near the town of Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. The name "Gallim" is derived from the Hebrew word meaning "springs" or "heaps," possibly indicating the presence of water sources or mounds in the area.
