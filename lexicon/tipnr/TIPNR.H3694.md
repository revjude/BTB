Chesulloth, also referred to as Chisloth-tabor or Tabor, was a town located on the border between the territories of Issachar and Zebulun \([[Josh.19.12|Joshua 19:12]], 18\). It is mentioned in the description of the boundaries of these two tribes during the division of the Promised Land. 

The town's association with Tabor suggests that it was situated near Mount Tabor, a prominent landmark in the region. Mount Tabor is known for its strategic location and its role in various biblical events, such as Deborah and Barak's victory over Sisera \(Judges 4-5\). 

In [[1Chr.6.77|1 Chronicles 6:77]], Tabor is mentioned as one of the cities given to the Levites from the tribe of Zebulun, along with its common-land. This indicates that Chesulloth, or a portion of it, was allocated to the Levites for their use and sustenance. 

The exact location of Chesulloth is uncertain, but its proximity to Mount Tabor and its position on the border between Issachar and Zebulun suggest that it was a significant settlement in the region during the time of Joshua and the early Israelite period.
