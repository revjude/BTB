Heman was a prominent Levite and musician during the reign of King David. He was a descendant of Kohath, one of the sons of Levi \([[1Chr.6.33|1Ch.6.33]]\). Heman, along with Asaph and Ethan, was appointed by David to lead the music and worship in the tabernacle \([[1Chr.15.17|1Ch.15.17]],19; 16.41,42\). He was known for his skill in playing the cymbal \([[1Chr.16.42|1Ch.16.42]]\). Heman had fourteen sons and three daughters, all of whom were under his direction in providing music for the house of the Lord \([[1Chr.25.1|1Ch.25.1]],4-6\). During the reign of Solomon, Heman and his fellow musicians participated in the dedication of the temple \([[2Chr.5.12|2Ch.5.12]]\). Later, during the reigns of Hezekiah and Josiah, Heman's descendants continued to serve as musicians in the temple \([[2Chr.29.14|2Ch.29.14]]; 35.15\). Heman's significant role in the tabernacle and temple worship highlights the importance of music in Israelite worship. \([[1Chr.6.33|1Ch.6.33]]; 15.17,19; 16.41,42; 25.1,4-6; [[2Chr.5.12|2Ch.5.12]]; 29.14; 35.15\).
