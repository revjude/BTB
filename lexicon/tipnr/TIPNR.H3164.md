Jahdiel is mentioned in [[1Chr.5.24|1 Chronicles 5:24]] as one of the mighty warriors and heads of a father's house in the half-tribe of Manasseh, east of the Jordan. This passage is part of a genealogical record of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, who settled in the region of Gilead \(1Ch.5.1-26\). 

The half-tribe of Manasseh, along with the tribes of Reuben and Gad, had requested to settle in the land east of the Jordan, as it was suitable for their abundant livestock \(Num.32.1-5\). Moses granted their request on the condition that they would help their fellow Israelites.
