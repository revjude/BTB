Japhia is mentioned in [[2Sam.5.15|2 Samuel 5:15]] and [[1Chr.3.7|1 Chronicles 3:7]] and 14:6 as one of the sons born to King David in Jerusalem. He was born after David had conquered the city and established it as his capital. Japhia's mother is not named, but he was one of several children born to David through his various wives. The Bible does not provide any further information about Japhia's life, his relationship with his father or siblings, or any roles he may have played in the royal court. His inclusion in the lists of David's sons emphasizes the importance of family lineage and the growth of David's household during his reign in Jerusalem.
