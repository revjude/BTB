- his mother was Zeruiah<[[H6870G]]>;

Abishai was the son of Zeruiah, King David's sister, making him David's nephew \([[1Chr.2.16|1 Chronicles 2:16]]\). He was the brother of Joab and Asahel, two other prominent figures in David's military ranks \([[2Sam.2.18|2 Samuel 2:18]]\). Abishai was one of David's mighty men and a trusted commander in his army. 

During David's flight from King Saul, Abishai accompanied him and showed his loyalty by offering to kill Saul when they found him sleeping in the camp \(1 Samuel 26:6-9\). However, David refused to allow Abishai to harm the Lord's anointed \([[1Sam.26.9|1 Samuel 26:9]]-11\). 

Abishai played a significant role in many of David's military campaigns. He fought alongside Joab against Abner and the forces of Ish-bosheth \([[2Sam.2.24|2 Samuel 2:24]]\). After Abner killed Asahel, Joab and Abishai pursued him but were convinced to halt their pursuit \([[2Sam.2.24|2 Samuel 2:24]]-28\). Later, Abishai supported Joab in avenging Asahel's death by killing Abner \([[2Sam.3.30|2 Samuel 3:30]]\). 

In the battle against the Ammonites, Abishai led a division of the army and helped secure victory for Israel \([[2Sam.10.10|2 Samuel 10:10]]-14; [[1Chr.19.11|1 Chronicles 19:11]]-15\). He also accompanied David during the rebellion of Absalom and was one of the three commanders of David's forces \([[2Sam.18.2|2 Samuel 18:2]],5,12\). 

Abishai intervened to save David's life when a giant named Ishbi-benob threatened to kill the king \([[2Sam.21.17|2 Samuel 21:17]]\). He was also known for his bravery and military exploits, being credited with killing three hundred men with his spear \([[2Sam.23.18|2 Samuel 23:18]]; [[1Chr.11.20|1 Chronicles 11:20]]\). 

Throughout David's reign, Abishai remained a loyal and trusted commander, playing a crucial role in maintaining David's kingdom and defending Israel against its enemies.
