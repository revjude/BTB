Man living at the time of Divided Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Jabesh</span>, the son of Shallum, conspired against and assassinated Zechariah, becoming king of Israel, but reigned for only one month before being killed by Menahem \([[2Kgs.15.10|2Ki.15.10]],13-14\).
- A man of the Kingdom of Israel, living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Kgs.15.10|2Ki.15.10]]; 
- only referred to as Jabesh **<big>[[H3003|יָבֵשׁ]]</big>**; 
-  father of Shallum **<big>[[H7967|שַׁלּוּם]]</big>**.

Jabesh, the son of Shallum, appears in [[2Kgs.15.10|2 Kings 15:10]], 13-14 as a short-lived king of Israel during a period of political instability. He conspired against Zechariah, the son of Jeroboam II, and assassinated him in front of the people, thereby ending the dynasty of Jehu \([[2Kgs.15.10|2Ki.15.10]]\). 

After killing Zechariah, Jabesh became king of Israel, but his reign lasted only one month \([[2Kgs.15.13|2Ki.15.13]]\). He was then killed by Menahem, the son of Gadi, who attacked Jabesh from Tirzah and succeeded him as king \([[2Kgs.15.14|2Ki.15.14]]\). 

The brief account of Jabesh's reign highlights the turbulent political climate in Israel during this period, characterized by frequent coups, assassinations, and short-lived kings. The northern kingdom of Israel was in a state of decline, facing internal strife and external threats from the growing power of Assyria. 

Jabesh's actions in assassinating Zechariah and seizing the throne demonstrate the lack of stability and the disregard for the Davidic covenant, which had promised an enduring dynasty for David's descendants \(2Sa.7.12-16\). The rapid succession of kings and the violence associated with their rise and fall were indicative of the spiritual and moral decay in Israel, which would ultimately lead to the nation's downfall and exile.
