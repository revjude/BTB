Raddai is mentioned in the genealogy of David as one of his brothers, a son of Jesse from Bethlehem \([[1Chr.2.14|1 Chronicles 2:14]]\). He is listed among David's seven brothers, including Eliab, Abinadab, Shimea, Nethaneel, Ozem, and the unnamed seventh brother. Raddai was likely born and raised in Bethlehem, where Jesse's family lived. However, no further information is provided about Raddai in the Bible, and he is not mentioned in the narrative of David's life or reign. His inclusion in the genealogy serves to establish David's family background and lineage.
