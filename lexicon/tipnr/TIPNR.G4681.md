Spain is mentioned in the New Testament only in Paul's letter to the Romans. In [[Rom.15.24|Romans 15:24]] and 28, Paul expresses his intention to visit Spain to preach the gospel after he has gone to Jerusalem to deliver the collection for the poor among the saints. It is unclear whether Paul ever fulfilled this intention, as there is no biblical record of him reaching Spain. However, some traditions suggest that Paul may have traveled to Spain after his first Roman imprisonment \(1 Clement 5:7\). At the time, Spain \(Latin: Hispania\) was a Roman province covering most of the Iberian Peninsula.
