Man living at the time of the New Testament

Paul sends greetings to those who belong to the household of <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Aristobulus</span>, suggesting that Aristobulus was a prominent believer in Rome.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Rom.16.10|Rom.16.10]]; 
- only referred to as Aristobulus **<big>[[G0711|Ἀριστόβουλος]]</big>**.

Aristobulus is mentioned briefly in Paul's letter to the Romans, where the apostle sends greetings to "those who belong to the household of Aristobulus" \(Rom. 16:10\). This greeting suggests that Aristobulus was a prominent member of the Christian community in Rome, and that his household, which likely included family members, servants, and slaves, had also embraced the Christian faith. 

The fact that Paul specifically mentions Aristobulus' household implies that Aristobulus himself was a well-known figure, either within the church or in Roman society. However, beyond this brief greeting, no further information is provided about Aristobulus' background, conversion, or role in the early church. 

Some scholars speculate that Aristobulus may have been a member of Herod's family or a prominent Jewish figure in Rome, but there is no conclusive evidence to support these theories. The mention of his name in Paul's letter serves as a reminder of the diversity within the early church and the spread of the gospel message across various social and cultural boundaries.
