Obadiah was a prophet who delivered a message of judgment against the nation of Edom \(Obadiah 1:1\). The book of Obadiah, the shortest book in the Old Testament, contains his prophecy. Obadiah's message focused on the pride and cruelty of Edom, a nation descended from Esau, who had mistreated the people of Judah. He foretold the destruction of Edom and the restoration of Israel. The prophecy emphasizes God's justice and sovereignty over the nations. The exact date of Obadiah's ministry is uncertain, but it likely took place sometime after the Babylonian conquest of Judah.
