Shemiramoth was a Levite who served as a musician during the reign of King David. He is mentioned in [[1Chr.15.18|1 Chronicles 15:18]], 20, and 16:5 in the context of the transportation of the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem. In [[1Chr.15.18|1 Chronicles 15:18]], Shemiramoth is listed among the Levites appointed by David to play the lyres and harps in the procession of the ark. He is specifically named among those who were to play the harps \([[1Chr.15.20|1 Chronicles 15:20]]\). Later, in [[1Chr.16.5|1 Chronicles 16:5]], Shemiramoth is mentioned as one of the Levites who ministered before the ark of the Lord with musical instruments after it had been brought to Jerusalem. These references highlight Shemiramoth's role as a skilled musician and his participation in the significant event of bringing the ark to its new resting place in the capital city.
