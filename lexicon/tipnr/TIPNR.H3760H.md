Mount Carmel is a mountain range stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the southeast, located in northern Israel. It is most famously associated with the prophet Elijah and his confrontation with the prophets of Baal \([[1Kgs.18.19|1 Kings 18:19]]-40\). On Mount Carmel, Elijah challenged the people of Israel to choose between the Lord and Baal, and he demonstrated the power of the true God by calling down fire from heaven. 

After the contest, Elijah slaughtered the prophets of Baal at the Brook Kishon \(1 Kings 18:40\) and then went to the top of Mount Carmel to pray for rain, ending a three-year drought \([[1Kgs.18.42|1 Kings 18:42]]-45\). The mountain is also mentioned in [[2Kgs.2.25|2 Kings 2:25]] and 4:25, in connection with the prophet Elisha, who was Elijah's successor. 

Mount Carmel's lush vegetation and beauty made it a symbol of fertility and God's blessing in the Bible \(Isaiah 35:2; Jeremiah 50:19; Amos 9:3\). The mountain's strategic location and natural resources also made it a place of military and political significance throughout history.
