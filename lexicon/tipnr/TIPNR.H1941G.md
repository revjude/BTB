Hodiah, also referred to as Judah, is mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as a Levite who played a significant role in the religious life of the Israelites after their return from Babylonian exile. He is listed among the Levites who helped Ezra teach the Law to the people \([[Neh.8.7|Nehemiah 8:7]]\) and was one of those who led the people in worship and confession \([[Neh.9.5|Nehemiah 9:5]]\). 

In [[Neh.10.10|Nehemiah 10:10]], Hodiah is among the Levites who signed the covenant to follow the Law of God, demonstrating his commitment to the spiritual renewal of the nation. He is also mentioned in [[Neh.12.8|Nehemiah 12:8]] as one of the Levites who participated in the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, a significant event marking the completion of the city's restoration. 

As a Levite, Hodiah would have had responsibilities related to the temple service, teaching, and worship. His involvement in key religious events and his signature on the covenant highlight his leadership role within the Levitical community and his dedication to the spiritual well-being of the Israelites during this crucial period of rebuilding and renewal.
