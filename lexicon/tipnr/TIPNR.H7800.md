Susa, also known as Shushan, was the capital city of the Persian Empire during the reigns of Darius I, Xerxes I \(Ahasuerus\), and Artaxerxes I. It is mentioned in the books of Nehemiah, Esther, Daniel, and Ezra. Nehemiah served as cupbearer to King Artaxerxes in Susa \(Neh. 1:1\). The events of the Book of Esther took place primarily in Susa, where Esther became queen and saved her people from Haman's plot \(Esth. 1-9\). Daniel's vision of the ram and the goat took place while he was in Susa \(Dan. 8:2\). Susa is also mentioned in [[Ezra.4.9|Ezra 4:9]] among the places from which people were sent to hinder the rebuilding of Jerusalem. The city was located in modern-day southwestern Iran and served as a royal residence and administrative center for the Persian kings.
