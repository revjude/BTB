- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.2|Ezr.2.2]]; 
- only referred to as Baanah<[[H1196I]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>ַּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ֲ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>\).

Baanah is listed among the leaders who returned to Jerusalem from Babylonian exile, as recorded in [[Ezra.2.2|Ezra 2:2]] and [[Neh.7.7|Nehemiah 7:7]]. He was part of the group that accompanied Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, in the first wave of returnees. The lists in Ezra and Nehemiah provide a record of the individuals and families who made the journey back to their homeland to rebuild the temple and the city of Jerusalem. Baanah's presence among the leaders suggests he held a position of responsibility and influence within the community of exiles. The text does not provide any further information about his specific role or contributions to the resettlement process.
