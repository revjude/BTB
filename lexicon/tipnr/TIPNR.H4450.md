Milalai is mentioned briefly in the book of Nehemiah as a priest who participated in the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem \([[Neh.12.36|Neh.12.36]]\). After the completion of the wall's reconstruction under Nehemiah's leadership, a great celebration was held to dedicate the wall. Two large choirs were appointed to give thanks and walk on top of the wall in opposite directions \(Neh.12.31,38\). Milalai is listed among the priests who went with one of the choirs, along with other priests and Levites \([[Neh.12.36|Neh.12.36]]\). These priests played trumpets and other musical instruments as part of the celebration and thanksgiving to God. No additional information about Milalai's background, family, or specific priestly duties is provided in the biblical text. His mention serves to highlight the involvement of priests and musicians in the joyous dedication ceremony of Jerusalem's wall.
