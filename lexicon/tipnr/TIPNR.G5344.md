Felix was a Roman procurator \(governor\) of Judea who served from approximately 52 to 60 AD. He is mentioned in the book of Acts in connection with the apostle Paul's imprisonment and trial. Paul was brought before Felix in Caesarea after being accused by the Jewish leaders of being a troublemaker and inciting riots \(Acts 23:24, 26\). During the hearing, Paul defended himself against the charges and spoke about his faith in Christ \(Acts 24:10-21\). Felix, who was well-informed about Christianity, postponed making a decision and kept Paul in custody, hoping to receive a bribe from him \(Acts 24:22-26\). Felix also heard Paul speak about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, which caused him to be afraid \(Acts 24:25\). However, Felix left Paul in prison for two years until his successor, Porcius Festus, took office \(Acts 24:27\). The account of Paul's interaction with Felix highlights the challenges faced by early Christians in the face of Roman authority and the corruption within the judicial system.
