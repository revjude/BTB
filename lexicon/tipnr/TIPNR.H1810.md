Dilean was a city situated in the lowlands, or Shephelah, of Judah \([[Josh.15.38|Joshua 15:38]]\). It was part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land under Joshua. The city is mentioned only once in the Bible, along with other cities in the Shephelah region. The exact location of Dilean is unknown, but it was likely located in the western foothills of Judah, between the coastal plain and the Judean hills. As one of the cities in the Shephelah, Dilean would have been strategically important for the defense and agricultural production of the region.
