Troas, also known as Alexandria Troas, was a city located on the western coast of Asia Minor \(modern-day Turkey\), near the site of ancient Troy. The city was an important seaport and a significant center for trade and commerce. In the New Testament, Troas is mentioned several times in connection with the apostle Paul's missionary journeys. During his second missionary journey, Paul received a vision of a man from Macedonia pleading with him to come and help them while he was in Troas \(Acts 16:8-10\). This vision prompted Paul and his companions to sail from Troas to Macedonia, marking a significant expansion of the gospel into Europe. Later, during his third missionary journey, Paul spent a week in Troas, where he preached late into the night \(Acts 20:5-12\). During this visit, a young man named Eutychus fell asleep and fell from a window, but Paul raised him back to life. Paul also visited Troas on other occasions \(2 Cor. 2:12; 2 Tim. 4:13\), indicating the city's importance as a strategic location for his ministry.
