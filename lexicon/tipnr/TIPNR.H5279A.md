- A woman of the Ammonites living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Kgs.14.21|1Ki.14.21]]; 
- only referred to as Naamah **<big>[[H5279|נַעֲמָה]]</big>**; 
- wife of Solomon **<big>[[H8010|שְׁלֹמֹה]]</big>**; 
-  mother of Rehoboam **<big>[[H7346|רְחַבְעָם]]</big>**.

Naamah was an Ammonite woman who became the wife of King Solomon of Israel and the mother of his successor, King Rehoboam of Judah \([[1Kgs.14.21|1 Kings 14:21]],31; [[2Chr.12.13|2 Chronicles 12:13]]\). The Ammonites were a neighboring people of the Israelites, often in conflict with them throughout their history. 

Naamah's marriage to Solomon was likely a political alliance, as it was common for kings to marry foreign princesses to strengthen diplomatic ties and maintain peace with neighboring kingdoms. However, Solomon's many foreign wives, including Naamah, are cited as a reason for his eventual downfall, as they led him to worship other gods \(1 Kings 11:1-8\). 

As the mother of Rehoboam, Naamah played a significant role in the history of the Davidic dynasty. Rehoboam became king after Solomon's death, but his harsh treatment of the people led to the division of the kingdom into two separate realms: Israel in the north and Judah in the south \(1 Kings 12\). 

The mention of Naamah's Ammonite heritage in both 1 Kings and 2 Chronicles suggests that her foreign origins were significant to the biblical authors. It serves as a reminder of the influence that foreign alliances and marriages had on the religious and political life of ancient Israel, sometimes leading to the erosion of the nation's faithfulness to God.
