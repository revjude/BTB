Beth-eden, meaning "house of pleasure" or "house of delight" in Hebrew, is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Amos 1:5. The prophet Amos, in his prophecy against Damascus \(the capital of Aram or Syria\), declares that the Lord will break the gate bars of Damascus and cut off the inhabitants from the Valley of Aven and the one who holds the scepter from Beth-eden. 

The exact location of Beth-eden is not specified in the Bible, but it is associated with the rulers of Aram. The context suggests that it may have been a royal residence or a place of importance for the Aramean kings. 

The reference to the "one who holds the scepter" indicates that Beth-eden was a seat of power or authority. The scepter is a symbol of kingship and rule, so the phrase implies that Beth-eden was a place from which the kings of Aram exercised their dominion. 

Amos's prophecy against Aram was delivered during a time when the Arameans were a significant threat to Israel and Judah. The prophecy foretells the destruction of Damascus and the downfall of the Aramean rulers, including those associated with Beth-eden.
