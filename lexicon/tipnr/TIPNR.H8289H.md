Sharon is mentioned in [[1Chr.5.16|1 Chronicles 5:16]] as a region east of the Jordan River where the descendants of Gad pastured their flocks. This reference occurs in the context of the genealogy and territorial allotment of the tribe of Gad. The Gadites, known for their skill in warfare and their large numbers of livestock, settled in the region of Gilead and Bashan, which included the area of Sharon. This Sharon is distinct from the well-known coastal plain of Sharon west of the Jordan. The exact location and extent of this eastern Sharon are not specified in the biblical text. It likely refers to a fertile grazing area within the territory of Gad, suitable for the tribe's extensive herds and flocks. The mention of Sharon in this context highlights the importance of livestock and pastureland in the economy and lifestyle of the Gadites.
