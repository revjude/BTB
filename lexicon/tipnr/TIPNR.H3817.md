People from Leumm\(?\)

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Leummim</span>, a son of Dedan and descendant of Abraham and Keturah \([[Gen.25.3|Gen.25.3]]\).
- People from Leumm\(?\) of the Patriarchs, only mentioned at [[Gen.25.3|Gen.25.3]]; 
- only referred to as Leummim<[[H3817]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>ֻ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>מ</span>ִּ֑<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ים</span>\); 
- descended from Dedan<[[H1719C]]> along with Asshurim<[[H0805A]]> and Letushim<[[H3912]]>.

Leummim was one of the sons of Dedan, who was a son of Jokshan, born to Abraham and his wife Keturah \([[Gen.25.3|Gen.25.3]]\). He is mentioned in the genealogy of Abraham's descendants through Keturah, which is recorded after the death of Sarah. The Leummim are listed among the descendants of Jokshan, along with the Asshurim and Letushim. No further information is provided about Leummim or his descendants in the biblical record. It is likely that they became a tribe or clan that settled in the region of Arabia, as many of Abraham's descendants through Keturah are associated with Arab tribes.
