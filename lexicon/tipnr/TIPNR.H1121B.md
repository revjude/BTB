Beno was a Levite who belonged to the family of Merari, one of the three main divisions of the Levites \(1 Ch. 24:26-27\). He was a son of Jaaziah, who was a descendant of Merari. The Merarites were responsible for the tabernacle's structural components, such as its frames, crossbars, posts, and bases \(Num. 3:36\). Although no further details about Beno's specific role are provided, his mention in the genealogy underscores the importance of the Levitical families in maintaining the tabernacle and later the temple services.
