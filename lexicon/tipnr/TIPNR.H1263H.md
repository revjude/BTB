- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.10.6|Neh.10.6]]; 
- only referred to as Baruch<[[H1263H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>ָּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>רו</span>ּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ך</span>ְ\).

Baruch is mentioned in [[Neh.10.6|Nehemiah 10:6]] as one of the priests who sealed the covenant made during the time of Nehemiah. After the Israelites had returned from Babylonian exile and rebuilt the wall of Jerusalem, they gathered to confess their sins and commit to obeying God's law. Nehemiah 10 records the names of those who signed this agreement, including leaders, priests, and Levites. Baruch's presence on this list indicates that he was a member of the priestly family and held a position of authority within the religious community. By sealing the covenant, Baruch publicly declared his commitment to follow God's commandments and to support the spiritual and social reforms initiated by Nehemiah.
