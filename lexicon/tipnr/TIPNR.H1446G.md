Gedor, also known as Geder, is mentioned in the Bible as a town located in the hill country of Judah. It is listed among the towns allotted to the tribe of Judah in [[Josh.15.58|Joshua 15:58]], along with other nearby settlements such as Halhul, Beth-zur, and Maarath. 

In [[1Chr.4.4|1 Chronicles 4:4]], Penuel, the father of Gedor, is mentioned as a descendant of Judah through Hur, suggesting that the town may have been founded or settled by members of this Judahite clan. Additionally, in [[1Chr.4.18|1 Chronicles 4:18]], Jered, the father of Gedor, is listed among the descendants of Ezrah, another member of the tribe of Judah. 

Gedor is also associated with some of the mighty men who joined David at Ziklag when he was fleeing from Saul. In [[1Chr.12.7|1 Chronicles 12:7]], Joelah and Zebadiah, sons of Jeroham of Gedor, are mentioned among the Benjamite warriors who came to David's aid. 

In [[Josh.12.13|Joshua 12:13]], Geder is mentioned in the context of the kings defeated by Joshua during the conquest of Canaan. The king of Geder is listed among the thirty-one kings who were conquered by the Israelites under Joshua's leadership. 

The exact location of Gedor is not specified in the Bible, but based on its association with the hill country of Judah and its proximity to other known towns, it is believed to have been situated southwest of Jerusalem, possibly near the modern-day village of Khirbet Jedur.
