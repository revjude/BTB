Solomon's Portico was a colonnade or covered walkway located on the east side of the temple complex in Jerusalem \(Josephus, Antiquities 15.11.3\). It was a place where people gathered, and where the apostles often met to teach and preach the gospel message after Pentecost. Notable events that occurred here include the healing of the lame man by Peter and John \(Acts 3:11\) and the gathering of the early believers \(Acts 5:12\).
