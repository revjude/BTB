Rome, the capital city of the Roman Empire, plays a significant role in the New Testament. It was the seat of power for the vast empire that ruled over much of the known world during the time of Jesus and the early church. Rome is mentioned in various contexts throughout the book of Acts and the epistles. Paul, as a Roman citizen, appealed to Caesar and was brought to Rome to stand trial \(Acts 25:11-12; 28:16\). He spent at least two years under house arrest in Rome, during which time he wrote several epistles \(Acts 28:30-31; Eph. 6:20; Phil. 1:13; Col. 4:18; Philem. 1:1\). Paul also expressed his desire to visit the church in Rome \(Acts 19:21; Rom. 1:10-15; 15:23-24\). The church in Rome, though not founded by Paul, was well-established and included both Jewish and Gentile believers \(Acts 28:17-28; Rom. 1:7; 16:3-16\). Rome was also the place where Emperor Claudius had expelled the Jews, including Aquila and Priscilla, leading them to settle in Corinth \(Acts 18:2\). Tradition holds that both Paul and Peter were martyred in Rome during the reign of Emperor Nero. The city of Rome, with its political and cultural significance, served as a strategic center for the spread of the gospel and the growth of the early church.
