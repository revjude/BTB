Woman living at the time of Divided Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Hushim</span> was one of the sons of Shaharaim, a Benjamite, born to him in the country of Moab.
- A woman from the tribe of Benjamin  living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Chr.8.8|1Ch.8.8]]; 
- only referred to as Hushim **<big>[[H2366|חוּשִׁים]]</big>**; 
- wife of Shaharaim **<big>[[H7842|שַׁחֲרַיִם]]</big>**; 
-  mother of Abitub **<big>[[H0036|אֲבִיטוּב]]</big>** and Elpaal **<big>[[H0508|אֶלְפַּעַל]]</big>**.

Hushim is mentioned in [[1Chr.8.8|1 Chronicles 8:8]] and 11 as one of the sons of Shaharaim, a descendant of Benjamin. Shaharaim had two wives, Hushim and Baara, and he sent them away. 

After Shaharaim divorced his wives, he had children in the country of Moab. Among these children was Hushim, along with his brothers Abitub and Elpaal. 

The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 8 traces the descendants of Benjamin, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The inclusion of Hushim in this genealogy indicates that he was part of the Benjamite clan, even though he was born in Moab. 

The mention of Shaharaim's wives and his children born in Moab suggests that there may have been a period of Benjamite migration or exile to Moab at some point in their history. However, the exact circumstances and timing of this event are not specified in the text. 

The genealogical records in Chronicles serve to establish the lineage and family connections of the Israelites, particularly in the post-exilic period when many of them were returning to their homeland and seeking to reestablish their identity as God's people.
