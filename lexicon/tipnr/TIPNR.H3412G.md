Jarmuth was a Canaanite city mentioned in the book of Joshua. Its king, Piram, joined an alliance against Joshua and the Israelites \([[Josh.10.3|Joshua 10:3]],5\). However, the Israelites defeated the alliance, and the king of Jarmuth was captured and put to death \([[Josh.10.23|Joshua 10:23]]\). The city was later allotted to the tribe of Judah \([[Josh.12.11|Joshua 12:11]]; 15:35\) and was inhabited by the people of Judah after the Babylonian exile \([[Neh.11.29|Nehemiah 11:29]]\). Jarmuth was located in the Shephelah, the lowland region of Judah, but its exact location is uncertain.
