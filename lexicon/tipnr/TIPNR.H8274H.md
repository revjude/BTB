In [[Neh.10.12|Nehemiah 10:12]], he is listed among the Levites who sealed the covenant, pledging to follow the Law of God. This covenant was a solemn commitment made by the people to obey God's commandments and maintain their identity as a holy nation. 

In [[Neh.12.8|Nehemiah 12:8]], Sherebiah is mentioned as one of the Levites who led the thanksgiving psalms during the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem. He, along with other Levites, was involved in the joyous celebration and worship that accompanied this significant event in the restoration of Jerusalem. 

Furthermore, in [[Neh.12.24|Nehemiah 12:24]], Sherebiah is named as one of the heads of the Levites, along with Hashabiah, who was responsible for leading the songs of thanksgiving and praise. This leadership role indicates Sherebiah's importance in the Levitical order and his contribution to the worship practices of the community.
