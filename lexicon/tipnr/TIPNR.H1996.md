The Valley of Hamon-gog is a prophetic location mentioned in the book of Ezekiel. In Ezekiel's vision, Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, leads a great army against Israel in the latter days. However, God intervenes and defeats Gog and his army, causing them to fall upon the mountains of Israel \(Ezekiel 38-39\). 

After this decisive battle, the Valley of Hamon-gog is designated as the burial place for Gog and his hordes \(Ezekiel 39:11\). The name "Hamon-gog" means "the multitude of Gog," reflecting the vast number of soldiers in Gog's army. The valley is described as being east of the sea, likely referring to the Dead Sea, and it will be a place of renown, known for the mass burial of Gog's defeated forces. 

The prophecy also mentions that the people of Israel will be burying the remains of Gog's army for seven months to cleanse the land \(Ezekiel 39:12-16\). The valley will be renamed the "Valley of Hamon-gog" as a reminder of God's judgment upon Gog and his forces. 

The exact location of the Valley of Hamon-gog is not specified in the Bible, as it is a prophetic place associated with future events. The prophecy of Gog and Magog's defeat and the subsequent burial in the Valley of Hamon-gog serves as a powerful message of God's sovereignty and protection over His people, Israel, in the face of overwhelming adversity.
