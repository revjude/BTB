Azaliah is mentioned in the Old Testament as the father of Shaphan the scribe. Shaphan played a significant role during the reign of King Josiah of Judah, who initiated religious reforms and the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem. In [[2Kgs.22.3|2 Kings 22:3]] and [[2Chr.34.8|2 Chronicles 34:8]], Shaphan is introduced as "the son of Azaliah" when he is sent by King Josiah to oversee the repairs of the temple. As the father of a prominent scribe and official in the royal court, Azaliah was likely a respected figure himself. His son Shaphan's involvement in the discovery of the Book of the Law during the temple repairs was a pivotal moment in Josiah's reforms and the spiritual revival of Judah.
