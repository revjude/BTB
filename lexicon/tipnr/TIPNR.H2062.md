- only referred to as Zeeb **<big>[[H2062|זְאֵב]]</big>**.

Zeeb was a prince of Midian during the time of the judges in Israel. When Gideon and his 300 men defeated the Midianite army, the Ephraimites captured Zeeb and another prince named Oreb at the winepress of Zeeb. They killed both princes and brought their heads to Gideon on the other side of the Jordan. The victory over Oreb and Zeeb was celebrated as a significant part of Gideon's triumph over the Midianites, who had been oppressing Israel. The Psalmist later refers to their defeat, asking God to make the enemies of Israel like Oreb and Zeeb.
