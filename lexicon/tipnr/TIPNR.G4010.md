Pergamum, also known as Pergamon, was an ancient city located in the region of Mysia in Asia Minor \(modern-day Turkey\). It is one of the seven churches mentioned in the Book of Revelation \(Rev. 1:11; 2:12\). In the letter to the church in Pergamum, the risen Christ commends the believers for holding fast to His name and not denying their faith, even in the face of martyrdom \(Rev. 2:13\). However, Christ also rebukes them for tolerating some who held to the teachings of Balaam and the Nicolaitans, which involved idolatry and sexual immorality \(Rev. 2:14-15\). Pergamum is described as the place where "Satan's throne" is located \(Rev. 2:13\), possibly referring to the city's numerous pagan temples and its status as a center of emperor worship. Despite the challenges and temptations they faced, the Christians in Pergamum are encouraged to repent and remain faithful, with the promise of receiving hidden manna and a new name \(Rev. 2:16-17\).
