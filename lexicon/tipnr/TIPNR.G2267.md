Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Herodion</span> was a relative of Paul in Rome to whom Paul sent greetings. \([[Rom.16.11|Rom.16.11]]\)
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Rom.16.11|Rom.16.11]]; 
- only referred to as Herodion **<big>[[G2267|Ἡρωδίων]]</big>**.

Herodion is mentioned briefly in Paul's letter to the Romans as one of Paul's fellow Jews and relatives in Rome. In his closing greetings, Paul sends a personal greeting to Herodion, along with a few others \([[Rom.16.11|Rom.16.11]]\). The fact that Paul specifically mentions Herodion as his relative suggests that they were kinsmen, possibly from the same tribe or family lineage. However, no further details about Herodion's background, conversion, or role in the Roman church are provided in the Bible. The name Herodion may indicate that he was a freedman or descendant of someone from the Herodian household, but this is not certain. \([[Rom.16.11|Rom.16.11]]\).
