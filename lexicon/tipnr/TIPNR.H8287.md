Sharuhen, also known as Shaaraim or Shilhim, was a town allotted to the tribe of Simeon within the territory of Judah \(Josh. 19:6; 1 Chr. 4:31; Josh. 15:32\). The different names may refer to the same place or to closely related settlements in the same area. Sharuhen is listed among the towns in the southern part of Judah's territory, in the Negev region. It was one of the towns given to Simeon when the tribe received an inheritance within Judah's allotment \(Josh. 19:1-9\). The exact location of Sharuhen is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the semi-arid region south of Hebron. Some scholars propose identifying it with Tell el-Far'ah, a site about 12 miles south of Gaza, where excavations have revealed remains from the Middle Bronze Age and later periods. However, this identification remains tentative due to limited archaeological evidence. The mention of Sharuhen in the lists of towns allotted to Simeon and Judah highlights the close relationship between the two tribes and the integration of Simeon's territory within Judah's borders.
