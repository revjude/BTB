Ananiah is mentioned in [[Neh.11.32|Nehemiah 11:32]] as one of the towns inhabited by the Benjamites after their return from the Babylonian exile. It is listed along with other towns such as Anathoth, Nob, and Hazor, indicating its location in the territory of Benjamin, north of Jerusalem. 

The exact site of Ananiah is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the vicinity of Anathoth, which is approximately 3 miles \(5 km\) northeast of Jerusalem. Some scholars propose identifying Ananiah with the modern village of al-Eizariya, also known as Bethany, located on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives. 

Apart from its mention in the list of towns resettled by the Benjamites, no other information about Ananiah is provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in the post-exilic record in Nehemiah suggests that it was a significant settlement during the period of Jewish restoration in the land of Judah.
