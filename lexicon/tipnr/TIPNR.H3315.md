Japheth was one of the three sons of Noah, along with Shem and Ham, as recorded in [[Gen.5.32|Genesis 5:32]] and 6:10. He and his brothers were born before the Great Flood. Japheth, his wife, and his brothers and their wives entered the ark with Noah and survived the Flood \([[Gen.7.13|Genesis 7:13]]\). After the Flood, Noah blessed Japheth, saying, "May God extend Japheth's territory; may Japheth live in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be the slave of Japheth" \([[Gen.9.27|Genesis 9:27]]\). Japheth's descendants are listed in [[Gen.10.2|Genesis 10:2]]-5 and [[1Chr.1.5|1 Chronicles 1:5]]-7, and they are generally associated with the Indo-European peoples, including the Greeks, Medes, and Thracians. The name Japheth means "enlargement" or "expansion," which is fitting given the widespread distribution of his descendants. Japheth's offspring played a significant role in the repopulation of the earth after the Flood and the development of various nations and cultures.
