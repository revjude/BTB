<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Galal</span>, a Levite musician and descendant of Jeduthun, lived in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile and assisted in the temple service.
- A man from the tribe of Levi  living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[1Chr.9.16|1Ch.9.16]]; 
- only referred to as Galal<[[H1559H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ג</span>ָּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>\); 
- a son of Jeduthun<[[H3038H]]>; 
-  father of Shemaiah<[[H8098F]]>.

Galal is mentioned in [[1Chr.9.16|1 Chronicles 9:16]] and [[Neh.11.17|Nehemiah 11:17]] as one of the Levites who lived in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. He was a descendant of Jeduthun, one of the three chief musicians appointed by David to lead worship in the temple \(1 Chronicles 25:1, 6\). Galal's inclusion in these lists suggests that he, like his ancestor Jeduthun, was a skilled musician who served in the temple. In [[Neh.11.17|Nehemiah 11:17]], Galal is described as assisting in the temple service, likely in a musical capacity. The Levites were responsible for various duties in the temple, including music, singing, and assisting the priests \(1 Chronicles 23:28-32\). The mention of Galal and other Levites living in Jerusalem after the exile demonstrates the importance of restoring worship and maintaining the temple services as the Jewish community rebuilt their lives in the land.
