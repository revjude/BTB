Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Keros</span> was the name of a family of temple servants \(Nethinim\) who returned to Jerusalem from Babylonian exile.
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.44|Ezr.2.44]]; 
- only referred to as Keros **<big>[[H7026|קֵירֹס]]</big>**.

Keros is mentioned in [[Ezra.2.44|Ezra 2:44]] and [[Neh.7.47|Nehemiah 7:47]] as the name of a family of temple servants, also known as Nethinim, who returned to Jerusalem from Babylonian exile. The Nethinim were a group of people assigned to assist the Levites in the maintenance and service of the temple. 

In both Ezra and Nehemiah, the list of returning exiles includes the Nethinim, among whom the family of Keros is mentioned. This indicates that the Keros family was part of the group of temple servants who returned to Jerusalem to help rebuild the temple and restore the worship of God. 

The inclusion of the Keros family in the list of returning exiles highlights the importance of the Nethinim in the restoration of the temple and the religious life of the Jewish community after the Babylonian exile. It also demonstrates the continuity of service and dedication among the families who had been assigned to assist in the temple, even through the difficult period of exile. 

Apart from these two mentions in the lists of returning exiles, no further information is provided about the specific roles, size, or history of the Keros family within the Nethinim.
