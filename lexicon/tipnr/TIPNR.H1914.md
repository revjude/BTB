- A man living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Sam.23.30|2Sa.23.30]]; 
- referred to as Hiddai<[[H1914]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ַּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>\), or Hurai<[[H2360]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>חו</span>ּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>\).

Hiddai \(also known as Hurai\) is mentioned in [[2Sam.23.30|2 Samuel 23:30]] and [[1Chr.11.32|1 Chronicles 11:32]] as one of David's mighty men. He is described as being from the brooks of Gaash, which is likely a reference to his place of origin. The brooks of Gaash were probably located in the hill country of Ephraim, near the burial place of Joshua \(Joshua 24:30\). 

As one of David's mighty men, Hiddai would have been known for his exceptional bravery, military skills, and loyalty to the king. The mighty men were an elite group of warriors who played a crucial role in David's military campaigns and in the establishment and defense of his kingdom. 

Although no specific details are provided about Hiddai's exploits or achievements, his inclusion in the list of David's mighty men suggests that he was a valiant and distinguished soldier who contributed significantly to David's success as a military leader and king.
