The Valley of Zephathah is mentioned in the Bible as the location where King Asa of Judah confronted Zerah the Cushite and his vast army \([[2Chr.14.10|2Ch.14.10]]\). Zerah had invaded Judah with an army of one million men and 300 chariots, but Asa called upon the Lord for help and went out to meet them in this valley. Despite being outnumbered, Asa and his army defeated the Cushites, pursuing them as far as Gerar. The exact location of the Valley of Zephathah is uncertain, but it was likely somewhere in the Negev region, south of Judah, on the route from Egypt to Jerusalem.
