Dumah is mentioned in the genealogies of [[Gen.25.14|Genesis 25:14]] and [[1Chr.1.30|1 Chronicles 1:30]] as one of the twelve sons of Ishmael, the son of Abraham and Hagar. Ishmael's descendants became twelve princes according to their nations \(Genesis 25:16\), fulfilling the promise God made to Abraham regarding Ishmael \(Genesis 17:20\). 

The name Dumah means "silence" or "stillness" in Hebrew. Some scholars suggest that the name may be associated with the oasis of Dumah \(modern-day Dumat Al-Jandal\) in northwestern Arabia, which was an important stop on the caravan trade routes. 

Apart from being listed among Ishmael's sons, no further information is provided about Dumah in the Bible. His inclusion in the genealogies serves to highlight the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham concerning Ishmael and to trace the origins of the Arab peoples who descended from him. 

Dumah's descendants, along with those of his brothers, likely became nomadic tribes that inhabited the regions of the Arabian Peninsula. These tribes played a significant role in the early history and development of the Arab world.
