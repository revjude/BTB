Mikloth is mentioned in the book of 1 Chronicles as one of the military commanders who served during the reign of King David \([[1Chr.27.4|1Ch.27.4]]\). He was the leader of the second division of David's army, which was responsible for serving during the second month of each year. The army was divided into twelve divisions, each serving for one month, to ensure a well-organized and efficient military structure. Mikloth's division consisted of 24,000 men, and he served under the command of Dodai the Ahohite \([[1Chr.27.4|1Ch.27.4]]\). This arrangement allowed for a rotation of troops and provided a consistent military presence throughout the year. No further details about Mikloth's background, family, or specific military exploits are provided in the biblical text. His mention serves to document the organization of David's army and the individuals who held leadership positions within each division.
