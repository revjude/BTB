Jael was the wife of Heber the Kenite, an ally of the Israelites during the time of the judges. She is best known for her role in the defeat of Sisera, the commander of the Canaanite army under King Jabin of Hazor \(Jdg.4.2\). 

After the Israelite victory over the Canaanites led by Deborah and Barak, Sisera fled on foot and sought refuge in Jael's tent \([[Judg.4.17|Jdg.4.17]]\). Jael welcomed him, offering him milk and a place to rest. Sisera, exhausted from the battle, fell asleep in her tent \([[Judg.4.18|Jdg.4.18]]-19\). 

While Sisera slept, Jael took a tent peg and a hammer, and drove the peg through his temple, killing him \([[Judg.4.21|Jdg.4.21]]\). When Barak came in pursuit of Sisera, Jael showed him the dead commander, thus confirming the Israelite victory \([[Judg.4.22|Jdg.4.22]]\). 

Jael's actions are also celebrated in the Song of Deborah \(Jdg.5\), where she is praised as "most blessed of women" for her bravery and decisive role in the defeat of the Canaanites \([[Judg.5.24|Jdg.5.24]]-27\). 

Jael's story highlights the significant role that women played in the history of Israel, as well as the importance of cunning and courage in the face of enemy threats. Her actions, though violent, are portrayed as an act of loyalty to the Israelites and a means of bringing about God's deliverance for His people.
