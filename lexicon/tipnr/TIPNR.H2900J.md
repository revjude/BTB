- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Zech.6.10|Zec.6.10]]; 
- only referred to as Tobijah **<big>[[H2900|טוֹבִיָּה]]</big>**.

Tobijah is mentioned in [[Zech.6.10|Zechariah 6:10]] and 6:14 as one of the postexilic Jews who provided silver and gold to make crowns for Joshua the high priest. He is described as one of the exiles, along with Heldai and Jedaiah, who came from Babylon to Jerusalem. The crowns were to be placed in the temple as a memorial and a symbol of God's blessing upon Joshua and the future Messiah, the Branch. Tobijah's contribution to this prophetic act demonstrates the participation and support of the returned exiles in the restoration of the temple and the spiritual life of the Jewish community.
