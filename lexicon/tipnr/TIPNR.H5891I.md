The genealogy lists several descendants of Caleb, including Jahdai and his sons. Ephah is named alongside his brothers, but no further details are provided about his life, his role within the family, or any descendants he may have had. The inclusion of Ephah in the genealogy serves to provide a comprehensive record of Caleb's lineage and to highlight the various branches of his family tree. The mention of Jahdai and his sons, including Ephah, demonstrates the importance of documenting even the minor figures within the genealogies, as they contribute to the overall understanding of the family structure and the relationships between individuals within the tribe of Judah.
