Athaliah was the queen of Judah and the only woman to rule as a monarch in the kingdom's history. She was the daughter of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel of Israel and married Jehoram, king of Judah. After the death of her son Ahaziah, Athaliah seized power and ordered the execution of all potential heirs to the throne, except for the infant Joash, who was hidden away by his aunt Jehosheba. Athaliah ruled Judah for six years, promoting the worship of Baal. In the seventh year, the priest Jehoiada orchestrated a coup, crowned Joash as king, and had Athaliah put to death. During her reign, Athaliah had used resources from the temple of the Lord to support the temple of Baal. Her story illustrates the negative influence of the house of Ahab on the kingdom of Judah and the consequences of forsaking the worship of the true God.
