Uzza was a Benjamite man who was born in the land of Moab. He is mentioned in the genealogy of the descendants of Benjamin, which includes those who were born during the time when many Israelites were living in Moab. The context suggests this was likely during the Babylonian exile. Uzza and his brothers Naaman, Ahijah, and Gera were all born in Moab before Gera moved the family away from there.
