Halhul was a town mentioned in the list of cities and towns allotted to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land. It was located in the hill country of Judah, along with other towns such as Beth-zur, Gedor, and Beth-anoth \([[Josh.15.58|Joshua 15:58]]\). The hill country of Judah was a region characterized by its rugged terrain and elevated landscape, situated between the Shephelah \(lowlands\) to the west and the Wilderness of Judah to the east. Apart from this single reference in the book of Joshua, no further information about Halhul is provided in the Bible. Its exact location and history remain uncertain, as the town is not mentioned in any other biblical accounts or in known extra-biblical sources. However, the inclusion of Halhul in the list of Judah's towns suggests that it was a settlement of some importance during the time of Joshua and the initial allocation of the land to the Israelite tribes.
