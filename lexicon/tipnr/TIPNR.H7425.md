Remaliah is mentioned in the Bible as the father of Pekah, who became king of Israel \([[2Kgs.15.25|2 Kings 15:25]], 27, 30, 32, 37; 16:1, 5; [[2Chr.28.6|2 Chronicles 28:6]]; [[Isa.7.1|Isaiah 7:1]], 4, 5, 9; 8:6\). Pekah, son of Remaliah, was a captain in the army of King Pekahiah of Israel. He conspired against Pekahiah, killed him, and seized the throne \([[2Kgs.15.25|2 Kings 15:25]]\). Pekah reigned as king of Israel for 20 years \([[2Kgs.15.27|2 Kings 15:27]]\). During his reign, Pekah formed an alliance with King Rezin of Aram \(Syria\) and attacked Judah \([[2Kgs.15.37|2 Kings 15:37]]; 16:5; [[Isa.7.1|Isaiah 7:1]]\). However, their attack was unsuccessful, and the prophet Isaiah foretold the downfall of both Pekah and Rezin \([[Isa.7.4|Isaiah 7:4]]-9; 8:6\). Pekah was eventually assassinated by Hoshea, who became the next king of Israel \([[2Kgs.15.30|2 Kings 15:30]]\). The frequent mention of Pekah as "son of Remaliah" in the biblical text suggests that Remaliah was not a prominent figure himself, but rather was known primarily as the father of King Pekah.
