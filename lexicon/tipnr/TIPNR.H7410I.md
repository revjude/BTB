Ram is mentioned in the book of Job as an ancestor of Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram \([[Job.32.2|Job 32:2]]\). Elihu was one of the men who came to comfort Job during his affliction and ended up speaking to him about God's justice and sovereignty. The mention of Ram in Elihu's lineage suggests that he was from a respected family. However, no further details are provided about Ram himself in the Bible.
