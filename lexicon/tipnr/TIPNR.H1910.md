Hadad-rimmon is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Zech.12.11|Zechariah 12:11]], as a place of mourning. The prophet compares the future mourning of Jerusalem to the weeping at Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo. This is likely a reference to the lamentation over King Josiah, who was fatally wounded by Pharaoh Neco's archers at Megiddo \(2 Chronicles 35:22-25\). 

The name Hadad-rimmon combines the names of two Semitic deities: Hadad, the storm god, and Rimmon, a god of thunder, suggesting the location may have had cultic significance. Its exact location is uncertain, but it has been tentatively identified with Rummaneh, a village in the Jezreel Valley about 6 miles south of Megiddo. 

Zechariah's prophecy uses this historic event as a metaphor for the intense mourning that will take place when God pours out a spirit of grace and supplication on Jerusalem, causing them to look on the one they have pierced and mourn bitterly \(Zechariah 12:10\). The comparison emphasizes the depth and sincerity of the people's repentance.
