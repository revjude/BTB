- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.8.7|Neh.8.7]]; 
- only referred to as Maaseiah **<big>[[H4641|מַעֲשֵׂיָה]]</big>**.

Maaseiah was a Levite who helped explain the Law to the people during the time of Nehemiah \([[Neh.8.7|Neh.8.7]]\). After the reading of the Law by Ezra, Maaseiah was among the Levites who instructed the people and helped them understand the meaning of the words \([[Neh.8.7|Neh.8.7]]-8\). The Levites' role in teaching and interpreting the Law was crucial for the spiritual renewal of the Jewish community, as they sought to reestablish their covenant relationship with God. Maaseiah's involvement in this event demonstrates the importance of the Levites as teachers and spiritual guides for the people.
