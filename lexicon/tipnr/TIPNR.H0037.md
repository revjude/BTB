Abital was one of the wives of King David, the second king of Israel. She is mentioned in the lists of David's wives and children in both [[2Sam.3.4|2 Samuel 3:4]] and [[1Chr.3.3|1 Chronicles 3:3]]. Abital gave birth to one of David's sons, named Shephatiah. 

The biblical text does not provide any further information about Abital's background, her relationship with David, or her role in the royal household. She is one of several wives mentioned in the genealogies, highlighting David's practice of polygamy, which was common among kings in the ancient Near East. 

Abital's son Shephatiah is listed among David's sons born in Hebron, where David reigned over Judah for seven years before becoming king over all Israel \(2 Samuel 2:11; 5:5\).
