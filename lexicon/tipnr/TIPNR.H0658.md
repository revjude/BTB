Ephes-dammim, also known as Pas-dammim, was a place located between Socoh and Azekah in Judah where the Philistines and the Israelites faced each other in battle \([[1Sam.17.1|1 Samuel 17:1]]; [[1Chr.11.13|1 Chronicles 11:13]]\). It was the site of the famous confrontation between David and the Philistine giant Goliath. 

The Philistines had gathered their forces at Ephes-dammim, while Saul and the men of Israel were encamped in the Valley of Elah. Goliath, a champion from Gath, emerged from the Philistine camp and challenged the Israelites to send out a warrior to face him in single combat \(1 Samuel 17:4-10\). 

David, who had come to the Israelite camp to bring supplies to his brothers, accepted Goliath's challenge. With a sling and a stone, David defeated Goliath, leading to a great victory for the Israelites over the Philistines \(1 Samuel 17:48-53\). 

The alternate name Pas-dammim, used in [[1Chr.11.13|1 Chronicles 11:13]], may be a variant spelling or a scribal error. The exact location of Ephes-dammim is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the Shephelah, the foothills between the coastal plain and the Judean mountains, where many battles between the Israelites and Philistines took place.
