Ishbak is mentioned in two genealogical lists in the Bible \([[Gen.25.2|Gen.25.2]], [[1Chr.1.32|1Ch.1.32]]\) as one of the sons of Abraham by his concubine Keturah, whom he married after Sarah's death. Ishbak is listed along with his brothers Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, and Shuah. As a son of Abraham, Ishbak would have been sent away with gifts to the east country during Abraham's lifetime \(Gen.25.6\), preventing any rivalry with Isaac. The descendants of Ishbak are not mentioned further in the biblical narrative, and no additional details about his life are provided.
