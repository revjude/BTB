The Eznites are mentioned in [[2Sam.23.8|2 Samuel 23:8]] in reference to Adino, one of David's mighty men. The verse states that "Josheb-Basshebeth, a Tahkemonite, was chief of the Three; he raised his spear against eight hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter." Some translations render "Josheb-Basshebeth" as "Adino the Eznite," suggesting that he was from a place or clan called Eznite. The exact location or meaning of Eznite is not clear from the biblical text. Adino's feat of killing eight hundred men with his spear in a single battle highlights his exceptional skill and bravery as one of David's elite warriors.
