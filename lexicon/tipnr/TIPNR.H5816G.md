Uzziel was a Levite, the son of Kohath and grandson of Levi. He was the brother of Amram, making him the uncle of Moses and Aaron. Uzziel had three sons: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri. His descendants, the Uzzielites, were one of the Levite clans responsible for the care and transportation of the tabernacle. Uzziel's son Elzaphan and his brother Mishael were called by Moses to carry away the bodies of Nadab and Abihu after they offered unauthorized fire before the Lord. The descendants of Uzziel were also counted in the census of the Levites and given specific duties in the service of the tabernacle.
