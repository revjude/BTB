Jehallelel is mentioned in [[2Chr.29.12|2 Chronicles 29:12]] as one of the Levites who participated in the purification of the temple during the reign of King Hezekiah. He is identified as a member of the Merari clan, one of the three main divisions of the Levites. When Hezekiah became king, he initiated a series of religious reforms aimed at restoring the worship of the Lord and cleansing the temple, which had been neglected and defiled during the reign of his father, Ahaz. Jehallelel, along with other Levites from the clans of Kohath and Gershon, responded to the king's command and took part in the purification process. They cleansed the temple, removed the unclean items, and prepared it for proper worship. The text does not provide any further details about Jehallelel's specific role or contributions during this event. However, his participation in the temple purification highlights the importance of the Levites in maintaining the sanctity of the temple and assisting in the religious reforms initiated by the king.
