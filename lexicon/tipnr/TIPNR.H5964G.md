Alemeth, also referred to as Almon, is mentioned in [[1Chr.6.60|1 Chronicles 6:60]] as one of the cities given to the Levites from the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. It was assigned to the descendants of Aaron, the priestly family within the Levites. The city's exact location is not specified in the Bible, but it was situated within the tribal lands of Benjamin. The allocation of cities to the Levites, including Alemeth, ensured that they had places to live and carry out their religious duties among the other Israelite tribes.
