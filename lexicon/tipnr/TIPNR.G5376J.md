Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Philip</span>, one of the seven deacons chosen by the early church in Jerusalem, who preached the gospel in Samaria and baptized an Ethiopian eunuch.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[2Tim.2.17|Act.6.5]]; 
- referred to as Philip or \[ \] \(KJV= Philip\) <[[G5376J]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Φίλιππος</span>\).

Philip was one of the seven men chosen by the early church in Jerusalem to serve as deacons, responsible for the daily distribution of food to widows \(Acts 6:5\). After the martyrdom of Stephen, a great persecution arose against the church, and the believers were scattered. Philip went to Samaria and preached the gospel, performing miracles and casting out unclean spirits \(Acts 8:4-8\). Many Samaritans believed and were baptized, including Simon the sorcerer \(Acts 8:9-13\). 

Philip was then directed by an angel to go south on the road from Jerusalem to Gaza, where he encountered an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians \(Acts 8:26-28\). The eunuch was reading from the book of Isaiah, and Philip explained to him the good news about Jesus \(Acts 8:29-35\). The eunuch believed and was baptized by Philip \(Acts 8:36-38\). After this, Philip was miraculously transported by the Spirit to Azotus, and he continued preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea \(Acts 8:39-40\). 

Later, Philip is mentioned as one of the "seven" and referred to as "Philip the evangelist" \(Acts 21:8\). He had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy \(Acts 21:9\). Paul and his companions stayed with Philip in Caesarea during Paul's final journey to Jerusalem \(Acts 21:8-16\).
