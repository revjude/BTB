Meshullam is mentioned in the book of 2 Kings as the grandfather of Shaphan the scribe \([[2Kgs.22.3|2Ki.22.3]]\). Shaphan played a significant role during the reign of King Josiah of Judah. He was sent by the king to the temple to oversee the temple repairs and the collection of funds. During this process, Hilkiah the high priest discovered the Book of the Law, which Shaphan then brought and read to King Josiah. This event led to Josiah's religious reforms.
