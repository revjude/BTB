- A man living at the time before the Flood, first mentioned at [[Gen.4.26|Gen.4.26]]; 
- referred to as Enosh **<big>[[H0583|אֱנוֹשׁ]]</big>**, or Enos \(KJV= Enosh\)  **<big>[[G1800|Ἐνώς]]</big>**;

Enosh, the son of Seth and grandson of Adam, is mentioned in the genealogy of the righteous line \([[Gen.5.6|Gen.5.6]],7\). He was born when Seth was 105 years old and lived a total of 905 years \([[Gen.5.6|Gen.5.6]],11\). Enosh's birth is significant because it marks a turning point in human history. The text states that during his time, people began to call upon the name of the Lord \([[Gen.4.26|Gen.4.26]]\). This suggests a shift towards the public worship and invocation of God's name, possibly in response to the increasing wickedness and violence in the world. The beginning of this religious practice is attributed to the time of Enosh, highlighting his influence and the importance of his generation in the development of faith. Enosh's long life is consistent with the extended lifespans of the pre-flood patriarchs, and his descendants continued the righteous lineage \([[Gen.5.9|Gen.5.9]],10\). He is also mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus Christ, connecting him to the Messianic line \([[Luke.3.38|Luk.3.38]]\). Enosh's legacy lies in the establishment of public worship and the recognition of the need for a relationship with God in the face of a fallen world.
