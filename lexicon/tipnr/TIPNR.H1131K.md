Binnui, the son of Henadad, was a Levite who participated in repairing a section of Jerusalem's wall during the time of Nehemiah \(Neh. 3:24\). He worked on the wall near his house, following the repairs made by Azariah, son of Maaseiah. The repair of Jerusalem's walls was a significant project undertaken by Nehemiah to restore the city's security and strength after the Babylonian exile. Binnui's involvement in this project demonstrates the collective effort and dedication of the Jewish community, including the Levites, in rebuilding their homeland.
