- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.1.8|Ezr.1.8]]; 
- only referred to as Mithredath **<big>[[H4990|מִתְרְדָת]]</big>**.

Mithredath is mentioned in [[Ezra.1.8|Ezra 1:8]] as the treasurer of King Cyrus of Persia. He played a significant role in the return of the Jewish exiles to Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the Temple. 

According to the text, King Cyrus issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to their homeland and rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. As part of this decree, Cyrus ordered Mithredath, his treasurer, to oversee the return of the gold and silver articles that had been taken from the Temple by the Babylonians when they destroyed Jerusalem and exiled the Jews. 

Mithredath carried out the king's command and carefully counted the Temple articles before handing them over to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah, who was responsible for leading the first group of exiles back to Jerusalem. This act of returning the Temple articles demonstrated Cyrus' support for the Jewish people and their religious practices, as well as his respect for their God. 

As the treasurer, Mithredath held a position of great trust and responsibility in the Persian court. His involvement in the return of the Temple articles highlights the administrative role played by Persian officials in facilitating the restoration of Jewish life and worship in their homeland. 

Although no further details are provided about Mithredath's life or career, his brief mention in the book of Ezra serves to underscore the significant political and logistical support provided by the Persian Empire in the early stages of the Jewish return from exile.
