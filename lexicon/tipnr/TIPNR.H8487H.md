Teman was a region and town in the land of Edom, named after Teman, the grandson of Esau \(Gen. 36:11; 1 Chr. 1:36\). It was located in the northern part of Edom, possibly near modern-day Tawilan, east of Petra \(Ezek. 25:13\). Teman was known for its wisdom, and the Temanites were famous for their wise men \(Jer. 49:7; Obad. 1:8-9\). Eliphaz, one of Job's comforters, was from Teman \(Job 2:11\). The region is mentioned in prophecies of judgment against Edom \(Jer. 49:20; Amos 1:12; Hab. 3:3\). Teman was an important Edomite tribe, and its name was sometimes used as a synonym for Edom itself \(Amos 1:12; Obad. 1:9\).
