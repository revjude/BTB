The Kidron Valley, also referred to as the Valley of Jehoshaphat, is a deep ravine located east of Jerusalem, separating the city from the Mount of Olives. The valley is mentioned several times in the Bible as the location of important events. King David crossed the Kidron Valley when fleeing from his son Absalom \([[2Sam.15.23|2 Samuel 15:23]]\). King Asa burned the idol of his mother, Maacah, in the Kidron Valley \([[1Kgs.15.13|1 Kings 15:13]]; [[2Chr.15.16|2 Chronicles 15:16]]\). During the religious reforms of King Josiah, the objects used for idol worship were burned and their ashes thrown into the Kidron Valley \([[2Kgs.23.4|2 Kings 23:4]], 6, 12\). The valley is also associated with the prophetic visions of Joel, who referred to it as the Valley of Jehoshaphat, where God would gather the nations for judgment \(Joel 3:2, 12\). In the New Testament, Jesus crossed the Kidron Valley with his disciples to enter the Garden of Gethsemane on the night of his betrayal \([[John.18.1|John 18:1]]\). The Kidron Valley has been used as a burial place for thousands of years, and it holds great significance for Jews, Christians, and Muslims.
