Beth-emek, meaning "house of the valley" in Hebrew, is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Josh.19.27|Joshua 19:27]], as part of the description of the border of the tribe of Asher. The town is listed along with other cities and landmarks, such as Cabul, Ebron, Rehob, and Hammon, which helped to delineate the extent of Asher's territory. 

The exact location of Beth-emek is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in the northwestern part of Canaan, within the allotted territory of Asher. The name "Beth-emek" suggests that the town was located in or near a valley. 

Asher's territory was located along the Mediterranean coast, north of the tribe of Manasseh and south of the Phoenician city of Tyre. The region was known for its fertile land and abundant resources, as mentioned in the blessing of Moses \(Deuteronomy 33:24-25\). 

No other details about Beth-emek are provided in the Bible, and the town is not mentioned in any other historical or archaeological context. Its inclusion in the description of Asher's border serves primarily to help define the extent of the tribe's territory in the Promised Land.
