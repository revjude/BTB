Amad is mentioned in [[Josh.19.26|Joshua 19:26]] as one of the towns on the border of the territory allotted to the tribe of Asher. It is listed along with other towns such as Allammelech, Misheal, and Shihor-libnath, indicating its location in the western part of Galilee, near the Mediterranean coast. The exact site of Amad is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the vicinity of the modern-day village of Umm el-Amad, approximately 10 miles \(16 km\) southeast of Acre. As a border town, Amad would have marked the extent of Asher's territory and may have served as a defensive outpost.
