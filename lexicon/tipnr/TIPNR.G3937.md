- only referred to as Parmenas **<big>[[G3937|Παρμενᾶς]]</big>**.

Parmenas was one of the seven men chosen by the apostles to serve as deacons in the early church in Jerusalem \(Acts 6:5\). As the number of believers grew, the apostles recognized the need for assistance in the daily distribution of food and care for the widows in the community. They instructed the believers to select seven men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and wisdom, to take on this responsibility. Parmenas was among those chosen, along with Stephen, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, and Nicolas. The selection of these seven men, including Parmenas, marked an important step in the organization and growth of the early church, as it allowed the apostles to focus on prayer and the ministry of the word while ensuring that the practical needs of the community were met.
