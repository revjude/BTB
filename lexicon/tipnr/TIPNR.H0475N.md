Eliashib is mentioned in Nehemiah 12:10, 22, 23 as a high priest in the lineage of the high priesthood. He was the father of Joiada and the ancestor of Jaddua, who served as high priest during the time of Alexander the Great \([[Neh.12.22|Nehemiah 12:22]]\). The text provides a genealogy of the high priests, tracing the line from Jeshua to Jaddua, with Eliashib being a key figure in this lineage. Eliashib's mention in this context highlights the importance of the high priesthood and its succession throughout the generations. The text also notes that one of Eliashib's grandsons married a daughter of Sanballat the Horonite, a prominent opponent of Nehemiah \([[Neh.13.28|Nehemiah 13:28]]\).
