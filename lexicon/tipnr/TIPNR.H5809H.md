Azzur was the father of Hananiah, a false prophet who prophesied against Jeremiah. In [[Jer.28.1|Jeremiah 28:1]], Hananiah is introduced as "the son of Azzur." Hananiah contradicted Jeremiah's prophecies about submitting to Babylon, claiming that God would break Babylon's yoke and restore the temple treasures within two years. Jeremiah denounced Hananiah's message as false, warning that he would die that year for promoting rebellion against the Lord. Hananiah died two months later, confirming he was not a true prophet. Identifying Hananiah as Azzur's son implies his family was known, though Azzur is not mentioned again.
