- A man living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Num.1.14|Num.1.14]];

Deuel, also known as Reuel, is mentioned in the book of Numbers as the father of Eliasaph, who was the leader of the tribe of Gad during Israel's wilderness journey. In [[Num.1.14|Numbers 1:14]], Eliasaph is identified as the son of Deuel when Moses and Aaron take a census of the Israelites. 

Later, in [[Num.2.14|Numbers 2:14]], Eliasaph is again mentioned as the leader of the tribe of Gad, and his father's name is given as Reuel. This variation in names has led some scholars to conclude that Deuel and Reuel refer to the same person, with the names being used interchangeably. 

Eliasaph's leadership role is further highlighted in [[Num.7.42|Numbers 7:42]],47, where he presents the offering for the tribe of Gad during the dedication of the tabernacle. In [[Num.10.20|Numbers 10:20]], Eliasaph is once again mentioned as the leader of the Gadites when the Israelites set out from Mount Sinai. 

The mention of Deuel/Reuel in these passages serves to identify Eliasaph and emphasize his role as a tribal leader during a significant period in Israel's history. As the father of Eliasaph, Deuel/Reuel would have been a respected figure within the tribe of Gad.
