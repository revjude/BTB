Pashhur son of Malchiah was a priest during the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah, according to [[Jer.21.1|Jeremiah 21:1]] and 38:1. When Jerusalem was under attack by the Babylonians, Zedekiah sent Pashhur and Zephaniah the priest to ask Jeremiah to inquire of the Lord for them, hoping for a miraculous deliverance. Later, Pashhur was among the officials who heard Jeremiah's message that the people should surrender to the Babylonians and urged the king to put Jeremiah to death for demoralizing the people. Pashhur's actions show him to be opposed to Jeremiah's prophetic message.
