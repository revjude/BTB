<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Theudas</span> was a Jewish rebel leader who was killed, and his followers scattered, by the Roman authorities.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Luke.1.3|Act.5.36]]; 
- only referred to as Theudas<[[G2333]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Θευδᾶς</span>\).

Theudas is mentioned in Acts 5:36 as an example of a failed messianic pretender. According to Gamaliel, a respected Pharisee, Theudas rose up claiming to be somebody important and gathered about four hundred men to follow him. However, he was killed, and his followers were dispersed, resulting in the failure of his movement. Gamaliel used Theudas and another rebel named Judas the Galilean as cautionary examples to dissuade the Jewish council from persecuting the apostles. He argued that if the apostles' movement was of human origin, it would fail like those of Theudas and Judas.
