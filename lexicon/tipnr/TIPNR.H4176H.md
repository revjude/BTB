Moreh is the name of two locations mentioned in the Bible. The first is a place near Shechem, where Abraham built an altar to the Lord after arriving in Canaan \(Gen 12:6\). It is described as being near the great tree \(or terebinth\) of Moreh, which served as a landmark and possibly a Canaanite sanctuary. The second location is a hill where Gideon camped before attacking the Midianites \(Judg 7:1\). This hill, also known as the "Little Hermon," is identified with modern-day Jebel ed-Duhy, located north of Mount Gilboa. The spring of Harod, where Gideon selected his 300 men, is believed to be Ain-Jalood, situated at the foot of the hill.
