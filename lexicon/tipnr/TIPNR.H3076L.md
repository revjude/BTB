Johanan, the son of Jehohanan, is mentioned in [[2Chr.28.12|2 Chronicles 28:12]] as one of the leaders of Ephraim during the reign of King Ahaz of Judah. When the army of Israel, led by King Pekah, defeated Judah and took captives to Samaria, Johanan and other leaders of Ephraim stood against this action. They rebuked the army, reminding them of their own sins and warning them not to add to their guilt by enslaving their fellow Israelites. Johanan and the other leaders insisted that the captives be released and provided for, demonstrating compassion and a desire to obey God's law. Their intervention led to the captives being clothed, fed, and anointed before being sent back to Judah \(2Ch.28.15\). Johanan's actions showcase his leadership, courage, and commitment to upholding God's commands, even in the face of opposition from his own people.
