Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, was a commander in the army of Israel during the reign of Joram. He was anointed king by a servant of Elisha the prophet, who instructed him to destroy the house of Ahab. Jehu carried out this mission zealously, killing Joram, Ahaziah \(king of Judah\), Jezebel, and all the descendants of Ahab. He also eradicated the worship of Baal in Israel. However, Jehu did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, continuing the worship of the golden calves. His dynasty lasted for four generations, as promised by God, but Israel suffered losses to the Arameans during his reign. Jehu's story is recorded in the books of 1 and 2 Kings, 2 Chronicles, and Hosea.
