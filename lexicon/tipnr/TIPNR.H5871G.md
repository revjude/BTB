Ain or Rimmon is mentioned in [[Num.34.11|Numbers 34:11]] as a place on the eastern boundary of the Promised Land, as described in the instructions for dividing the land among the Israelite tribes. It is listed between Shepham and the Sea of Chinnereth \(Galilee\), indicating its location in the northern part of the territory. 

The name Ain means "spring" or "fountain," while Rimmon means "pomegranate." It is unclear whether these refer to two separate places or a single location with a compound name. In [[Zech.14.10|Zechariah 14:10]], Rimmon is mentioned as a southern point in a prophetic description of the future transformation of Jerusalem and its surroundings. However, this Rimmon is likely a different location, as it is described as being south of Jerusalem. 

The exact location of the Ain or Rimmon mentioned in [[Num.34.11|Numbers 34:11]] is uncertain, but it was probably situated somewhere in the region east of the Sea of Galilee, in what later became the territory of the tribe of Naphtali.
