Tarsus was a prominent city in the Roman province of Cilicia, located in modern-day southern Turkey. It is best known as the birthplace and early residence of the apostle Paul \(Acts 22:3\). Paul described himself as "a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city" \(Acts 21:39\), indicating Tarsus' significance and his own status as a citizen. After his conversion on the road to Damascus, Paul spent time in Tarsus \(Acts 9:30\) before being brought to Antioch by Barnabas \(Acts 11:25\). Tarsus was a center of Greek culture and learning, with a renowned university. It was also an important commercial hub, situated on major trade routes. The city's strategic location and cultural influence shaped Paul's background and prepared him for his future ministry as an apostle to the Gentiles.
