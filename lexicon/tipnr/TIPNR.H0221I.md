- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.24|Ezr.10.24]]; 
- only referred to as Uri<[[H0221I]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>או</span>ּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>\).

Uri is mentioned briefly in [[Ezra.10.24|Ezra 10:24]] as one of the Israelites who had married foreign women during the Babylonian exile. During the time of Ezra's reforms, when the Israelites were called to repent and return to obedience to God's law, Uri was among those who agreed to put away their foreign wives. This action was part of a larger effort to restore the spiritual purity of the Jewish community and prevent the influence of pagan practices. No other details are provided about Uri's background or his specific family situation. His inclusion in this list highlights the widespread nature of the issue of intermarriage and the collective response of the people to Ezra's call for repentance.
