Suphah is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Num.21.14|Numbers 21:14]], as part of a quotation from the Book of the Wars of the Lord. The context suggests that Suphah was a place or region associated with the Israelites' journey through the wilderness. The exact location of Suphah is unknown, and there is little information provided about its geographical or historical significance. Some scholars propose a connection between Suphah and the Red Sea \(Yam Suph\) based on the similarity of the names, but this remains speculative. The Book of the Wars of the Lord, which is not found in the current biblical canon, appears to have been an ancient source recording Israel's military campaigns during the wilderness wanderings.
