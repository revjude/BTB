Rhodes is an island in the Aegean Sea, located off the southwestern coast of Asia Minor \(modern-day Turkey\). It is mentioned in the Bible as one of the stops on Paul's journey to Jerusalem. After leaving Cos, Paul and his companions sailed to Rhodes and then on to Patara \(Act. 21:1\). Rhodes was known for its strategic location, its strong naval fleet, and the Colossus of Rhodes, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The island had a significant Jewish population in the first century AD.
