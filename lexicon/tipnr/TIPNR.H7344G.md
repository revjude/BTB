Rehoboth was the name Isaac gave to a well he dug in the Valley of Gerar. After facing opposition from local herdsmen over two previous wells, Isaac moved on and dug this well, saying, "Now the Lord has given us room and we will flourish in the land" \(Gen. 26:22\). The name Rehoboth means "open spaces" or "room".
