King living at the time of United Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Hanun</span>, the Ammonite king, mistreated David's envoys, leading to a war between the Ammonites and Israel.
- An Ammonite king living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Sam.10.1|2Sa.10.1]]; 
- only referred to as Hanun **<big>[[H2586|חָנוּן]]</big>**; 
- a son of Nahash **<big>[[H5176|נָחָשׁ]]</big>**.

Hanun was the king of the Ammonites during the reign of King David of Israel. He is mentioned in 2 Samuel 10 and 1 Chronicles 19. After the death of Hanun's father, Nahash, who had shown kindness to David, David sent envoys to express his sympathy to Hanun \([[2Sam.10.1|2 Samuel 10:1]]-2; 1 Chronicles 19:1-2\). However, Hanun's advisors convinced him that David's envoys were spies, so Hanun humiliated them by shaving off half of their beards and cutting their garments short \([[2Sam.10.3|2 Samuel 10:3]]-4; [[1Chr.19.3|1 Chronicles 19:3]]-4\). This act was a grave insult and a violation of diplomatic protocol. When David heard about this, he was outraged and prepared for war against the Ammonites \(2 Samuel 10:5-7; [[1Chr.19.6|1 Chronicles 19:6]]-7\). Hanun, realizing his mistake, hired Syrian mercenaries to help him fight against Israel \(2 Samuel 10:6; [[1Chr.19.6|1 Chronicles 19:6]]-7\). However, the Israelite army, led by Joab and Abishai, defeated the Ammonites and their Syrian allies \(2 Samuel 10:8-14; 1 Chronicles 19:8-15\). The conflict continued, and David himself later joined the battle, capturing the Ammonite capital, Rabbah \(2 Samuel 12:26-31; 1 Chronicles 20:1-3\). Hanun's mistreatment of David's envoys and the resulting war highlight the importance of diplomatic relations and the consequences of disrespecting allies in the ancient Near East.
