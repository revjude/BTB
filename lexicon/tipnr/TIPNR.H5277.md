Man living before Israel's Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Naam</span> was a son of Caleb, mentioned in the genealogy of the tribe of Judah in 1 Chronicles.
- A man from the tribe of Judah  living before Israel's Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.4.15|1Ch.4.15]]; 
- only referred to as Naam **<big>[[H5277|נַעַם]]</big>**; 
-  son of Caleb **<big>[[H3612|כָּלֵב]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Achsah **<big>[[H5915|עַכְסָה]]</big>**, Iru **<big>[[H5900|עִירוּ]]</big>** and Elah **<big>[[H0425|אֵלָה]]</big>**.

Naam is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.4.15|1 Chronicles 4:15]] as one of the sons of Caleb, who was a prominent figure from the tribe of Judah. This reference appears in a genealogical record that traces the descendants of Judah, providing insight into the family lines within the tribe. 

Caleb, Naam's father, is known for his faithfulness to God during the Israelites' wilderness wanderings. He, along with Joshua, was one of the twelve spies sent to explore the land of Canaan \(Numbers 13-14\). Caleb and Joshua were the only two spies who encouraged the Israelites to trust God and enter the Promised Land. 

Apart from being listed as a son of Caleb, no additional information is provided about Naam's life, character, or role within the tribe of Judah. His mention in the genealogy serves primarily to highlight his lineage and his connection to Caleb, a significant figure in Israel's history. 

The inclusion of Naam in the genealogical record demonstrates the importance of family heritage and tribal identity in ancient Israelite society. These records helped establish the legitimacy of land claims and leadership roles within the community, as well as preserving the history of God's chosen people.
