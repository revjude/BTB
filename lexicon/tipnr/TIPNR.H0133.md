- A prince of Persia living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Esth.1.14|Est.1.14]]; 
- only referred to as Admatha **<big>[[H0133|אַדְמָתָא]]</big>**.

Admatha is mentioned in [[Esth.1.14|Esther 1:14]] as one of the seven princes of Persia and Media who served as advisors to King Ahasuerus \(also known as Xerxes I\). These seven princes had special access to the king's presence and were the most prominent officials in the Persian Empire. 

The context of Esther 1 describes a grand feast held by King Ahasuerus in the third year of his reign. During this feast, the king summoned his wife, Queen Vashti, to appear before him and his guests, but she refused. Angered by her refusal, the king consulted his wise men, including Admatha, to determine the appropriate course of action according to the law. 

Admatha, along with the other princes, advised the king to issue a royal decree proclaiming that Vashti would never again enter the king's presence and that her royal position would be given to another woman. This decree was intended to discourage other women in the kingdom from defying their husbands' authority. 

Apart from his role as one of the seven princes and his involvement in advising the king regarding Vashti's disobedience, no other information is provided about Admatha's personal life, background, or subsequent actions in the book of Esther.
