Joses, also known as Joseph, was one of the brothers of Jesus Christ and a son of Mary. He is mentioned by name in the Gospels of Mark and Matthew. In [[Mark.6.3|Mark 6:3]] and [[Matt.13.55|Matthew 13:55]], Joses/Joseph is listed along with James, Judas \(or Jude\), and Simon as Jesus' brothers. He was likely born after Jesus, as Jesus is referred to as Mary's firstborn \(Luke 2:7\). Joses/Joseph is also mentioned in the context of Jesus' crucifixion, where he is identified as the son of Mary, who was one of the women present at the crucifixion and burial of Jesus \([[Mark.15.40|Mark 15:40]], 47; [[Matt.27.56|Matthew 27:56]]\).
