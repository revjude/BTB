Raamah is mentioned in the Bible as one of the trading partners of the city of Tyre, along with Sheba \(Ezek. 27:22\). The merchants of Sheba and Raamah traded with Tyre, supplying them with the best of all kinds of spices, precious stones, and gold \(Ezek. 27:22\). The exact location of Raamah is uncertain, but it is generally believed to have been situated in the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula, possibly in the region of modern-day Yemen. This identification is based on the association of Raamah with Sheba, a kingdom known for its wealth and located in the southern Arabian Peninsula. The reference to Raamah in Ezekiel's prophecy highlights the extensive trade network of Tyre, which included distant lands such as Arabia. The precious commodities mentioned—spices, gems, and gold—were highly valued in the ancient world and contributed to Tyre's prosperity and reputation as a major commercial center.
