Gadi is mentioned in [[2Kgs.15.14|2 Kings 15:14]], 17 as the father of Menahem, who became king of Israel during a time of political instability. Menahem, the son of Gadi, assassinated Shallum, who had previously overthrown Zechariah to become king \(2 Kings 15:10, 14\). Menahem then reigned as king of Israel for ten years \([[2Kgs.15.17|2 Kings 15:17]]\). During his reign, Menahem faced the threat of the Assyrian king Pul \(Tiglath-Pileser III\) and paid him a large tribute to gain his support and strengthen his hold on the kingdom \(2 Kings 15:19-20\). Menahem's reign was marked by violence and oppression, as he brutally suppressed any opposition to his rule \(2 Kings 15:16\).
