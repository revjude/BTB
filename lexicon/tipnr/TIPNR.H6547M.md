Pharaoh living at the time of Divided Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Pharaoh</span>, the Egyptian ruler whose daughter Bithiah married Mered, a descendant of Judah.
- An Egyptian Pharaoh living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.4.18|1Ch.4.18]]; 
- only referred to as Pharaoh **<big>[[H6547|פַּרְעֹה]]</big>**; 
-  father of Bithiah **<big>[[H1332|בִּתְיָה]]</big>**.

This Pharaoh is mentioned briefly in the genealogy of Judah \([[1Chr.4.18|1 Chronicles 4:18]]\) as the father of Bithiah, who married Mered, a descendant of Judah through Ezrah. The genealogy states that Mered had two wives, one of whom was "Bithiah the daughter of Pharaoh." 

No further information is provided about this Pharaoh or his daughter Bithiah. The marriage of a Judahite to an Egyptian princess is unusual, and some scholars suggest that this may be a symbolic or metaphorical reference rather than a historical event. Others propose that Bithiah may have been the daughter of an Egyptian official or a lesser royal rather than the ruler himself. 

Given the lack of historical details and the context of the passage, it is difficult to determine the specific identity of this Pharaoh or the time period in which this marriage might have taken place.
