Hesed is mentioned in the Bible as one of the twelve district overseers appointed by King Solomon to provide supplies for the king and his household. Each overseer was responsible for provisioning the royal court for one month out of the year \(1Ki.4.7\). Hesed was in charge of the district of Arubboth \([[1Kgs.4.10|1Ki.4.10]]\). These district overseers were responsible for collecting and delivering the necessary provisions, such as food, drink, and other supplies, to support the king's vast household and administration. The appointment of these overseers reflects Solomon's wise governance and the organization of his kingdom. No other information about Hesed's personal life or background is provided in the Bible. \([[1Kgs.4.10|1Ki.4.10]]\).
