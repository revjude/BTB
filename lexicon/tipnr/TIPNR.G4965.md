Sychar is mentioned in [[John.4.5|John 4:5]] as a Samaritan city near the plot of ground that Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) had given to his son Joseph. It was located close to Jacob's well, where Jesus, tired from his journey, sat down and engaged in a conversation with a Samaritan woman \(John 4:6-26\). This encounter led to many Samaritans from the city believing in Jesus as the Christ \(John 4:39-42\). The exact location of Sychar is debated, but it is often identified with the modern village of Askar, situated about half a mile northeast of Jacob's well.
