Zechariah was a Levite who lived during the time of Ezra and Nehemiah, after the return from the Babylonian exile. When Ezra read the Book of the Law to the assembled people, Zechariah was one of the Levites who stood beside him on the platform. This public reading of the Law was a significant event in the spiritual reformation of the Jewish community. Zechariah's presence on the platform with Ezra indicates his status as a respected Levite and his involvement in the religious life of the community.
