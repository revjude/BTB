Chitlish is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Josh.15.40|Joshua 15:40]], as one of the towns allotted to the tribe of Judah in the Shephelah region. The Shephelah was a lowland area between the coastal plain and the Judean hills, known for its fertile soil and strategic importance. 

The exact location of Chitlish is unknown, and there is no further information about the town in the Bible. Its inclusion in the list of Judah's towns suggests that it was a recognized settlement during the time of Joshua and the division of the Promised Land. 

The name Chitlish may be derived from the Hebrew root "chatal," which means "to take away" or "to snatch." However, without additional context, the meaning and significance of the town's name remain uncertain. 

Given the limited biblical information, Chitlish appears to have been a small town in the Shephelah region of Judah, but its precise location, history, and role in the life of the Israelites are not elaborated upon in the text.
