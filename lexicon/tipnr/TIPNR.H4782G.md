- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.2|Ezr.2.2]]; 
- only referred to as Mordecai<[[H4782G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>מ</span>ׇ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ֳּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>כ</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>\).

Mordecai is mentioned in [[Ezra.2.2|Ezra 2:2]] and [[Neh.7.7|Nehemiah 7:7]] as one of the leaders who returned to Jerusalem from Babylonian captivity along with Zerubbabel. He is listed among the men who led the first group of exiles back to their homeland after the decree of King Cyrus of Persia, which allowed the Jews to return and rebuild the temple in Jerusalem. 

Apart from being named as a leader in this context, no additional information is provided about this particular Mordecai's background, family, or role in the community. His presence among the leaders suggests that he held a position of respect and authority among the returning exiles. 

The return of Mordecai and the other leaders marked a significant turning point in Jewish history, as the exiles began the process of rebuilding their lives, their city, and their temple in Jerusalem after decades of captivity in Babylon. This event set the stage for the restoration of Jewish religious and cultural identity in their homeland.
