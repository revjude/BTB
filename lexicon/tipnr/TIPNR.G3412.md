Mitylene was the capital city of the island of Lesbos, located in the northeastern Aegean Sea. It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Acts 20:14, as a stop on the Apostle Paul's journey from Troas to Jerusalem. Paul had traveled by foot from Troas to Assos, while his companions sailed to Assos, where they took Paul on board and sailed to Mitylene. The city was known for its beauty, culture, and literary heritage, being the birthplace of the famous poets Sappho and Alcaeus. In the Greco-Roman period, Mitylene was a prosperous and influential city, with a well-developed harbor and a strategic location on trade routes.
