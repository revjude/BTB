Harmon is a place name that appears only once in the Bible, in the book of Amos. In Amos 4:3, the prophet declares judgment upon the wealthy women of Samaria, saying, "You will go out through broken walls, each one straight ahead of her, and you will be cast out toward Harmon." The exact location and meaning of Harmon are uncertain, as the name is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in other ancient Near Eastern sources. Some scholars suggest that Harmon may refer to a place of exile or captivity, possibly in Assyria or Armenia, where the Israelites would be taken as a result of God's judgment. Others propose that it could be a symbolic name representing the fate of the exiled Israelites. The context of the passage suggests that Harmon is a place of punishment and humiliation for the proud and oppressive women of Samaria, who would be driven out of their city and cast into a foreign land. Amos's prophecy serves as a warning against the social injustice and religious unfaithfulness that characterized Israel during his time.
