Tolad is mentioned in [[1Chr.4.29|1 Chronicles 4:29]] as one of the towns allotted to the tribe of Simeon during the division of the Promised Land. It is listed along with other Simeonite towns such as Balah, Ezem, and Bethuel. The exact location of Tolad is unknown, but it was likely situated in the Negev region, in the southern part of Judah's territory. In Joshua 19:4, a town named El-tolad is mentioned among the towns given to Simeon, which may be the same as Tolad.
