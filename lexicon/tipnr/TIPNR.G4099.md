Pisidia was an ancient region located in the central part of Asia Minor \(modern-day Turkey\), north of Pamphylia and Lycia. It is mentioned in the New Testament in connection with Paul's first missionary journey \(Acts 13:14; 14:24\). Paul and Barnabas traveled to Antioch in Pisidia, where they preached in the synagogue on the Sabbath \(Acts 13:14-41\). Many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, but the jealous Jewish leaders stirred up persecution against them, forcing them to leave the city \(Acts 13:42-52\). Despite the opposition, the word of the Lord spread throughout the whole region \(Acts 13:49\). On their return journey, Paul and Barnabas passed through Pisidia again, strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain faithful \(Acts 14:21-23\). The mention of Pisidia in the book of Acts highlights the spread of the gospel in Asia Minor and the challenges faced by early Christian missionaries.
