Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Eliashib</span>, a priest, had ties to Tobiah the Ammonite and prepared a room for him in the temple courts.
- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Neh.13.4|Neh.13.4]]; 
- only referred to as Eliashib **<big>[[H0475|אֶלְיָשִׁיב]]</big>**.

Eliashib, a priest, is mentioned in [[Neh.13.4|Nehemiah 13:4]], 7 in relation to his ties with Tobiah the Ammonite, an opponent of Nehemiah. Prior to Nehemiah's return to Jerusalem, Eliashib had been put in charge of the storerooms in the temple \([[Neh.13.4|Nehemiah 13:4]]\). However, he allied himself with Tobiah and prepared a large room for him in the temple courts, which had previously been used to store grain offerings, incense, and temple articles \(Nehemiah 13:5\). Upon learning of this, Nehemiah was greatly displeased and threw out Tobiah's household goods from the room \([[Neh.13.7|Nehemiah 13:7]]-8\). This incident highlights the challenges Nehemiah faced in restoring proper worship and order in the temple, even among the priestly ranks.
