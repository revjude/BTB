Prophet living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Iddo</span> was a prophet in Casiphia to whom Ezra sent a message requesting Levites to assist in the temple service.
- A prophet living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at Ezr.8.17; 
- only referred to as Iddo **<big>[[H0112|אִדּוֹ]]</big>**.

Iddo is mentioned in Ezra 8:17 as a leader in Casiphia, a place whose exact location is unknown but was likely a Jewish settlement in Babylonia during the Persian period. He is described as being "at the place Casiphia," suggesting that he held a position of authority or influence there. 

In the context of Ezra 8, Ezra is preparing to lead a group of Israelites back to Jerusalem from Babylon. As part of his preparations, Ezra sends a message to Iddo and his brethren, requesting that they provide Levites to assist in the temple service. The text states that Ezra "told them what to say to Iddo and his brethren the temple servants at the place Casiphia, namely, to send us ministers for the house of our God." 

Iddo's role in this passage suggests that he was responsible for overseeing a community of Levites and temple servants in Casiphia. Ezra's request indicates that Iddo had the authority to send Levites to assist in the temple service in Jerusalem. 

The fact that Ezra specifically reached out to Iddo and the Levites in Casiphia highlights the importance of the Levitical role in the restoration of temple worship after the Babylonian exile. It also suggests that there were Jewish communities outside of Jerusalem that maintained their religious identity and were willing to support the rebuilding efforts in Jerusalem. 

Apart from this brief mention in Ezra 8, no other details are provided about Iddo's life or his role as a leader in Casiphia. However, his inclusion in the narrative emphasizes the significance of the Levites in the restoration of Jewish worship and the cooperation between Jewish communities in Babylon and Jerusalem during the post-exilic period.
