Ishvah is mentioned in two genealogical lists in the Bible as a son of Asher, who was one of the twelve sons of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) \([[Gen.46.17|Gen.46.17]], [[1Chr.7.30|1Ch.7.30]]\). He is listed along with his brothers Imnah, Ishuah, and Beriah, as well as his sister Serah. As a grandson of Jacob and great-grandson of Abraham, Ishvah was a member of the Israelite tribe of Asher. 

No other details are provided about Ishvah's life or role within the clan. His inclusion in these genealogies serves to trace the lineage of Asher and demonstrate the growth of the Israelite population in Egypt, as well as to establish the tribal structure that would later be important in the organization of the nation of Israel.
