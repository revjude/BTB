King living before Israel's Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Debir</span> was the Amorite king of Eglon who joined a coalition against Joshua but was defeated. \([[Josh.10.3|Jos.10.3]]\)
- An Amorite king living before Israel's Monarchy, only mentioned at [[Josh.10.3|Jos.10.3]]; 
- only referred to as Debir<[[H1688H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ְּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יר</span>\).

Debir was the Amorite king of Eglon during the time of Joshua's conquest of Canaan. He joined a coalition of five Amorite kings led by Adoni-Zedek, king of Jerusalem, to attack Gibeon after the Gibeonites made a peace treaty with Israel \([[Josh.10.3|Joshua 10:3]]-4\). 

In response to the Gibeonites' request for help, Joshua and the Israelite army marched all night from Gilgal and caught the Amorite kings by surprise. The Lord threw the Amorite armies into confusion, and Joshua's forces defeated them decisively \(Joshua 10:5-10\). 

As the Amorite kings fled, the Lord caused large hailstones to fall on them, killing more of them than the Israelites did with their swords \(Joshua 10:11\). Joshua then called for the sun and moon to stand still, allowing the Israelites to complete their victory \(Joshua 10:12-13\). 

The five Amorite kings, including Debir, were found hiding in a cave at Makkedah. They were captured, brought before Joshua, and executed \(Joshua 10:16-27\). 

Debir's defeat, along with the other Amorite kings, was a significant victory for the Israelites as they continued their conquest of the Promised Land under Joshua's leadership.
