- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[Ezek.16.45|Amo.1.1]]; 
- only referred to as Amos<[[H5986]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>מו</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ס</span>\).

Amos was a prophet from Tekoa who prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah, king of Judah, and Jeroboam, king of Israel \(Amos 1:1\). He was originally a shepherd and fig grower before being called by God to deliver His message \(Amos 7:14-15\). Amos prophesied against the sins of Israel, warning them of impending judgment \(Amos 7:8; 8:2\). His prophecies were met with opposition from Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, who told him to stop prophesying and leave \(Amos 7:10-13\). However, Amos remained faithful to his calling and continued to proclaim God's word.
