Nabal was a wealthy man from Carmel who lived during the time of King David. He is described as a Calebite, indicating his descent from the tribe of Judah. Nabal was married to Abigail, a beautiful and intelligent woman \([[1Sam.25.3|1 Samuel 25:3]]\). 

Despite his wealth, Nabal was known for his harsh and foolish behavior. When David and his men, who had been protecting Nabal's shepherds and flocks, requested provisions, Nabal rudely refused, insulting David and his men \([[1Sam.25.4|1 Samuel 25:4]]-11\). This foolish act provoked David to seek revenge, threatening to kill Nabal and all the males in his household. 

Abigail, upon learning of her husband's foolishness, quickly intervened. She gathered a generous supply of food and went out to meet David, apologizing for Nabal's behavior and pleading for mercy \(1 Samuel 25:18-31\). Her wise actions and words appeased David, who relented from his plan to attack Nabal's household. 

When Abigail informed Nabal of how close he had come to disaster, his heart failed him, and he became like a stone. About ten days later, the Lord struck Nabal, and he died \([[1Sam.25.3|1 Samuel 25:3]]6-38\). After Nabal's death, David sent for Abigail and married her \([[1Sam.25.3|1 Samuel 25:3]]9-42\). 

Nabal's story serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of foolishness, selfishness, and mistreating others. It also highlights the wisdom and courage of Abigail, who acted decisively to protect her household and make peace with David.
