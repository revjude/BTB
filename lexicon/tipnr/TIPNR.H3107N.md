- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.22|Ezr.10.22]]; 
- only referred to as Jozabad **<big>[[H3107|יוֹזָבָד]]</big>**.

Jozabad is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.22|Ezra 10:22]] as one of the priests who had married foreign women during the post-exilic period. The context of the passage is Ezra's reforms and the issue of intermarriage between the Israelites and the pagan peoples of the land \(Ezra 9-10\). 

Upon learning of the widespread intermarriage, Ezra led the people in confession and repentance \(Ezra 9:1-10:4\). The Israelites made a covenant to put away their foreign wives and children \(Ezra 10:5\). Jozabad is listed among the priests who had married foreign women and agreed to send them away \(Ezra 10:18-22\). 

This event highlights the importance of maintaining religious and cultural purity among the Israelites, especially in the post-exilic period when they were re-establishing their identity and covenant relationship with God.
