Man living at the time of United Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Ahio</span>, along with his brother Uzzah, drove the cart carrying the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim. \([[2Sam.6.3|2Sa.6.3]],4; [[1Chr.13.7|1Ch.13.7]]\)
- A man living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Sam.6.3|2Sa.6.3]]; 
- only referred to as Ahio **<big>[[H0283|אַחְיוֹ]]</big>**; 
-  son of Abinadab **<big>[[H0041|אֲבִינָדָב]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Eleazar **<big>[[H0499|אֶלְעָזָר]]</big>** and Uzzah **<big>[[H5798|עֻזָּא]]</big>**.

Ahio was the son of Abinadab, in whose house the ark of God had been kept for many years after it was returned by the Philistines. When David decided to bring the ark to Jerusalem, Ahio and his brother Uzzah were tasked with transporting it. 

They placed the ark on a new cart, with Uzzah walking alongside the ark and Ahio going before it. \([[2Sam.6.3|2Sa.6.3]],4; [[1Chr.13.7|1Ch.13.7]]\) However, during the journey, when the oxen stumbled, Uzzah reached out to steady the ark and was struck down by God for his irreverent act. \(2Sa.6.6-7; 1Ch.13.9-10\) 

The biblical text does not mention Ahio's reaction to his brother's death or provide any further details about his life. His role in the story is primarily as one of the two men entrusted with the responsibility of transporting the ark, which highlights the importance and sacredness of the ark in Israelite worship.
