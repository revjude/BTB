Tel-abib was a settlement of exiled Jews located by the Chebar River in Babylonia. It is mentioned in [[Ezek.3.15|Ezekiel 3:15]] as the place where the prophet Ezekiel lived among the exiles. The name "Tel-abib" means "mound of the flood" or "mound of the storm," possibly referring to the site's topography or its proximity to the river. Ezekiel received his prophetic visions and messages while residing in Tel-abib \(Ezek. 1:1; 3:22-23\). The Chebar River, near which Tel-abib was situated, was a major waterway in Babylonia, and several other Jewish settlements were located along its banks. The exiles in Tel-abib were among those deported from Judah by the Babylonians in the early 6th century BC. Ezekiel's presence and prophetic ministry in Tel-abib provided spiritual guidance and hope to the exiled community.
