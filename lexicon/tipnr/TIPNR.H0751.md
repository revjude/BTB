Erech, also known as Uruk or Warka, was an ancient Mesopotamian city located in the southern part of modern-day Iraq. It is mentioned twice in the Bible, in [[Gen.10.10|Genesis 10:10]] and [[Ezra.4.9|Ezra 4:9]]. 

In [[Gen.10.10|Genesis 10:10]], Erech is listed as one of the cities that formed the beginning of Nimrod's kingdom in the land of Shinar \(Babylonia\). Nimrod, a mighty hunter and ruler, is described as establishing a powerful kingdom that included the cities of Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh. 

[[Ezra.4.9|Ezra 4:9]] mentions the people of Erech among those who wrote a letter to King Artaxerxes of Persia, opposing the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple and the city walls after the Babylonian exile. This suggests that inhabitants of Erech were among those deported and resettled in other parts of the Persian Empire, and they sought to hinder the Jewish returnees' efforts to reestablish their homeland. 

Archaeologically, Erech is one of the oldest cities in Mesopotamia, with evidence of continuous habitation from the 5th millennium BC. It was an important center of Sumerian culture and religion, known for its impressive ziggurats and the Gilgamesh Epic, one of the earliest known works of literature. 

The biblical mentions of Erech, though brief, attest to its significance as an ancient Mesopotamian city and its interaction with the history and people of Israel, both in the early stages of civilization and during the post-exilic period.
