Zoar, also known as Bela, was one of the five cities of the plain, along with Sodom and Gomorrah \([[Gen.14.2|Gen.14.2]],8\). It was originally called Bela but was renamed Zoar, which means "small," when Lot pleaded for it to be spared from destruction due to its small size \(Gen.19:20-22\). Lot and his daughters fled to Zoar when God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah \([[Gen.19.23|Gen.19.23]]\). Later, Lot left Zoar and settled in the mountains with his daughters \(Gen.19:30\). Zoar is mentioned as a reference point for the description of the Promised Land \(Deut.34:3\). The prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah used Zoar to illustrate the extent of God's judgment on Moab \([[Isa.15.5|Isa.15.5]]; [[Jer.48.34|Jer.48.34]]\). Zoar is most likely located at the southern end of the Dead Sea, although its exact location is uncertain. It is possibly to be identified with Khirbet el-Keryeh or Tell Iktanu. The name Zair is used in reference to a different location, where Joram fought against Edom \([[2Kgs.8.21|2Ki.8.21]]\).
