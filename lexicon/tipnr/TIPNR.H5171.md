- A man living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Sam.23.37|2Sa.23.37]]; 
- only referred to as Naharai **<big>[[H5171|נַחֲרַי]]</big>**.

Naharai the Beerothite is mentioned in [[2Sam.23.37|2 Samuel 23:37]] and [[1Chr.11.39|1 Chronicles 11:39]] as one of King David's mighty men. These passages list the elite warriors who fought alongside David and played a crucial role in establishing and maintaining his kingdom. 

Naharai is specifically identified as the armor-bearer of Joab, who was the commander of David's army and one of the king's most trusted men. As an armor-bearer, Naharai would have been responsible for carrying Joab's armor and weapons, as well as assisting him in battle. This position required great trust and loyalty, as the armor-bearer would have been in close proximity to the commander during combat. 

The epithet "Beerothite" indicates that Naharai was from Beeroth, a town in the territory of Benjamin, north of Jerusalem. This suggests that Naharai may have been a member of the tribe of Benjamin who had joined David's forces. 

Naharai's inclusion among David's mighty men highlights his exceptional skill as a warrior and his unwavering loyalty to the king. These mighty men were known for their bravery and military prowess, often accomplishing remarkable feats in battle. Naharai's presence in this elite group is a testament to his abilities and his dedication to serving King David and the kingdom of Israel.
