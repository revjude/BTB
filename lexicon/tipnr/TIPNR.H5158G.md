The Brook of the Willows is mentioned in Isaiah's prophecy concerning Moab \([[Isa.15.7|Isaiah 15:7]]\). The context suggests that it was a boundary of Moab's territory, possibly in the south near the border with Edom. The exact location of the Brook of the Willows is uncertain, but some scholars identify it with the Wadi Zered, a seasonal stream that flows into the Dead Sea from the east. 

Isaiah's prophecy describes the devastation that would come upon Moab, causing its people to flee and carry their possessions to the Brook of the Willows. The mention of this brook highlights the extent of Moab's territory and the severity of the judgment that would force them to flee to their borders. The name "Brook of the Willows" may indicate the presence of willow trees along its banks, which could have provided shelter for the fleeing Moabites.
