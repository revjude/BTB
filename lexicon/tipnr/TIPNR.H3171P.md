- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.21|Ezr.10.21]];

Jehiel is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.21|Ezra 10:21]] as one of the priests who had married foreign women during the Babylonian exile. This chapter lists the names of the men who had taken foreign wives, including priests, Levites, and other Israelites. Jehiel is identified as one of the descendants of Harim, a priestly family. The fact that priests had married foreign women was particularly problematic, as they were expected to maintain ritual purity and set an example for the people. In response to Ezra's call for repentance, these men agreed to put away their foreign wives and children, demonstrating their commitment to following the Law of Moses and maintaining the distinct identity of the Israelite community. The text does not provide any additional information about Jehiel's background or his specific role as a priest.
