Shion is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the list of towns allotted to the tribe of Issachar during the division of the Promised Land \(Josh. 19:19\). It is listed along with other towns in the region, such as Shunem, Hapharaim, and Anaharath. The exact location of Shion is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the Jezreel Valley, within the territory of Issachar. Some scholars propose identifying Shion with Khirbet Sha'in, an archaeological site located approximately 4 miles northwest of Mount Tabor . However, this identification remains tentative due to limited archaeological evidence. The name "Shion" may be derived from the Hebrew verb "shw'," meaning "to be emptied or ravaged" , possibly indicating the town's history or condition. The mention of Shion in the allotment of Issachar's territory highlights the importance of the tribal inheritance and the distribution of towns and lands among the people of Israel.
