Madai is mentioned in the Table of Nations \(Gen.10\) and the genealogy of Chronicles \(1Ch.1\) as one of the sons of Japheth, the son of Noah. He is considered the ancestor of the Medes, an ancient Iranian people who inhabited the region of Media in western Iran. The Medes played a significant role in the ancient Near East, forming a powerful empire and later contributing to the Persian Empire. In the Bible, the Medes are known for their role in the fall of Babylon, as prophesied by Isaiah and Jeremiah \(Isa.13.17; Jer.51.11,28\). The inclusion of Madai in the Table of Nations and the genealogy of Chronicles emphasizes the biblical understanding of the origins and relationships of the various nations and people groups in the ancient world. As a descendant of Japheth, Madai is part of the lineage that spread out and populated the coastlands and islands, as described in Genesis 10.5.
