- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Kgs.16.10|2Ki.16.10]]; 
- referred to as Uriah or Uriah **<big>[[H0223|אוּרִיָּה]]</big>**.

Uriah was a priest who served during the reign of King Ahaz of Judah \([[2Kgs.16.10|2 Kings 16:10]]-16; [[Isa.8.2|Isaiah 8:2]]\). When Ahaz visited Damascus to meet with the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser, he saw a pagan altar that impressed him. Ahaz sent a model of the altar to Uriah, instructing him to build a replica in Jerusalem. Uriah faithfully followed the king's instructions and built the altar. Upon Ahaz's return, the king made offerings on the new altar and modified the temple's ritual to accommodate it, displacing the bronze altar prescribed by God. Uriah's compliance with the king's orders, despite their departure from proper worship, reflects the religious compromise and syncretism that characterized Ahaz's reign. The prophet Isaiah mentions Uriah as a witness to his prophecy about the coming Immanuel \([[Isa.8.2|Isaiah 8:2]]\), suggesting that Uriah was a recognized figure in Jerusalem's priestly community.
