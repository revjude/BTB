Ariel is mentioned in [[Ezra.8.16|Ezra 8:16]] as one of the leaders summoned by Ezra to assist in the return of the Jewish exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem. Ezra, a priest and scribe, led a group of Israelites back to Jerusalem during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia, with the purpose of teaching and enforcing the Law of Moses among the people. 

In preparation for the journey, Ezra gathered leading men to accompany him. Ariel is listed among these leaders, along with Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam. Ezra sent these men to Iddo, the leader at Casiphia, to request the assistance of Levites and temple servants for the house of God in Jerusalem. 

The mention of Ariel in this context highlights his role as a trusted leader among the exiles and his willingness to support Ezra in the important task of restoring worship and religious practices in Jerusalem. However, beyond this brief mention, no further details about Ariel's background, family, or specific contributions are provided in the biblical text.
