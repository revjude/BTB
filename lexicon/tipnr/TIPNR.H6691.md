Zophar the Naamathite was one of the three friends of Job who came to comfort him during his time of suffering. Along with Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite, Zophar visited Job after hearing about his affliction \([[Job.2.11|Job 2:11]]\). Zophar is mentioned as the third speaker in the cycles of dialogue between Job and his friends. In his first speech \(Job 11\), Zophar rebukes Job for justifying himself and accuses him of mocking God. He asserts that God's wisdom is unsearchable and that Job should repent of his supposed sins. In his second speech \(Job 20\), Zophar describes the fate of the wicked, implying that Job's suffering is a result of his wrongdoing. Zophar's speeches reflect the traditional belief that suffering is a consequence of sin and that righteousness leads to prosperity. However, the book of Job challenges this simplistic view and presents a more complex understanding of God's justice and human suffering. In the end, God rebukes Zophar and his friends for speaking falsely about Him and instructs them to offer sacrifices and seek Job's intercession \(Job 42:7-9\).
