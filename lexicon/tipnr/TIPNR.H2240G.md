- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.8|Ezr.2.8]]; 
- only referred to as Zattu **<big>[[H2240|זַתּוּא]]</big>**.

Zattu is mentioned in the lists of Jewish exiles who returned to Jerusalem from Babylon. In the accounts found in Ezra and Nehemiah, the descendants of Zattu are enumerated among the families who made the journey back to their homeland. The Ezra account records 945 members of Zattu's family, while Nehemiah's list mentions 845. These numbers suggest that the family of Zattu was a significant group among the returning exiles who helped rebuild Jerusalem and restore Jewish community life in the post-exilic period. Additionally, some members of Zattu's family are mentioned among those who had married foreign women and agreed to separate from them in response to Ezra's call for spiritual reformation.
