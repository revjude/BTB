Rechab is mentioned in 2 Samuel as the brother of Baanah, both captains in the army of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul \([[2Sam.4.2|2 Samuel 4:2]]\). After the death of Saul, Ishbosheth was made king over Israel, while David reigned over Judah \(2 Samuel 2:8-10\). Baanah and Rechab, who were from the tribe of Benjamin, betrayed Ishbosheth by sneaking into his house while he was resting and murdering him \([[2Sam.4.5|2 Samuel 4:5]]-7\). They brought Ishbosheth's head to David, hoping to gain favor with him \(2 Samuel 4:8\). However, David condemned their treacherous act and ordered their execution \([[2Sam.4.9|2 Samuel 4:9]]-12\). The actions of Rechab's sons contributed to the downfall of Ishbosheth and the eventual unification of Israel under David's rule. The story highlights the political instability and violence that characterized the early days of David's reign.
