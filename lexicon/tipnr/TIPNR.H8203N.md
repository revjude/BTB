Shephatiah, a descendant of Judah, is mentioned in [[Neh.11.4|Nehemiah 11:4]] as one of the people who settled in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. He is described as a son of Mahalalel, from the descendants of Perez, who was a son of Judah. This passage lists the inhabitants of Jerusalem who were chosen by lot to live in the city, with one out of ten settling there while the remaining nine stayed in other towns. Shephatiah's presence in Jerusalem indicates his involvement in the repopulation and restoration of the city after the exile.
