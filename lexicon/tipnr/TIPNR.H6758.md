Zalmonah was one of the places where the Israelites camped during their wilderness journey after leaving Egypt. It is mentioned in [[Num.33.41|Numbers 33:41]]-42 as part of the itinerary recorded in the Book of Numbers. The Israelites arrived at Zalmonah after departing from Mount Hor and before moving on to Punon. The exact location of Zalmonah is unknown, but it was situated somewhere between Mount Hor, where Aaron died \(Num. 20:22-29\), and Punon, another campsite mentioned only in the itinerary. No other details about Zalmonah are provided in the Bible, and the site is not mentioned in any other context. The inclusion of Zalmonah in the list of Israel's campsites highlights the detailed record-keeping of the Israelites' journey through the wilderness and their numerous stops along the way.
