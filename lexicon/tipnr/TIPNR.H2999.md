The Jabbok is a river located east of the Jordan River, in the region of Gilead. It is first mentioned in the Bible when Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) crossed it on his way back to Canaan after his time with Laban \([[Gen.32.22|Genesis 32:22]]\). It was at the Jabbok that Jacob wrestled with God and was given the name Israel \(Genesis 32:24-30\). The Jabbok served as a boundary between the territories of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan \([[Num.21.24|Numbers 21:24]]; Deuteronomy 2:37; 3:16; [[Josh.12.2|Joshua 12:2]]\). During the time of the judges, the Ammonites accused Israel of taking their land between the Arnon and the Jabbok \([[Judg.11.13|Judges 11:13]], 22\). The Jabbok River flows westward into the Jordan River and is known today as the Zarqa River in Jordan.
