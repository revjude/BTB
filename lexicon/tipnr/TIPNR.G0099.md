The Adriatic Sea is mentioned in Acts 27:27 as part of the narrative of Paul's journey to Rome as a prisoner. During the voyage, Paul's ship encountered a severe storm, and they were driven by the wind for many days. On the fourteenth night of the storm, the sailors sensed they were approaching land and took soundings, fearing they might run aground on the rocks. 

In the context of Acts 27, the term "Adriatic Sea" likely refers to a broader area that includes not only the modern Adriatic Sea between Italy and Croatia but also the central Mediterranean Sea south of Greece and west of Crete. This understanding is based on the usage of the term in ancient sources and the probable route of Paul's ship. 

The storm that Paul's ship encountered was likely a Euraquilo, a strong northeasterly wind that blows in the Mediterranean during the winter months. The ship was eventually wrecked on the island of Malta \(Acts 28:1\), where Paul and the other survivors were welcomed by the islanders and spent three months before continuing their journey to Rome. The mention of the Adriatic Sea in Acts 27 highlights the dangers and challenges of maritime travel in the ancient world and provides a vivid backdrop for Paul's perilous journey to stand trial before Caesar.
