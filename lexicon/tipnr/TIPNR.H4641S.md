Maaseiah was one of the individuals who sealed the covenant during the time of Nehemiah \([[Neh.10.25|Neh.10.25]]\). After the reading of the Law and the celebration of the Feast of Tabernacles, the people of Israel made a covenant to follow God's commandments and to separate themselves from the surrounding nations \(Neh.9-10\). Maaseiah is listed among the leaders, Levites, and priests who signed and sealed this covenant, pledging to uphold its terms \(Neh.10.1-27\). The sealing of the covenant was a significant act of commitment and dedication to God, demonstrating the people's desire to live according to His will.
