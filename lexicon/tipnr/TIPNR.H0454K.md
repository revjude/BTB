- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.27|Ezr.10.27]]; 
- only referred to as Elioenai **<big>[[H0454|אֶלְיְהוֹעֵינַי]]</big>**.

Elioenai is listed in the Book of Ezra as one of the Israelites who had married foreign women during the Babylonian exile \([[Ezra.10.27|Ezr.10.27]]\). After the return to Jerusalem, Ezra discovered that many Israelites had intermarried with the neighboring peoples, which was a violation of God's command. Elioenai was among those who had taken foreign wives, but he agreed to put away his wife as part of the covenant renewal led by Ezra.
