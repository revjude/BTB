Ahiman is mentioned briefly in a list of Levites who served as gatekeepers during the reign of King David. The gatekeepers were responsible for guarding the entrances to the tabernacle and later the temple. They ensured that only authorized individuals entered the sacred premises and maintained order. 

Ahiman is listed along with other gatekeepers, including Shallum, Akkub, and Talmon. These Levites and their descendants were entrusted with the important task of keeping watch over the gates of the house of the Lord. \([[1Chr.9.17|1Ch.9.17]]-19\) 

No further details about Ahiman's specific duties or life are provided in the Bible. His mention in this context highlights the significance of the gatekeeper role in maintaining the sanctity and security of the tabernacle and temple.
