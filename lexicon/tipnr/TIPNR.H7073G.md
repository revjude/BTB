Kenaz is mentioned in Genesis 36 and 1 Chronicles 1 as one of the clans of Edom, descended from Esau. In the genealogy of Esau, Kenaz is listed as one of the sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn son of Esau \([[Gen.36.11|Genesis 36:11]], 15; [[1Chr.1.36|1 Chronicles 1:36]]\). 

The Kenizzites, the clan named after Kenaz, are also mentioned among the chiefs of Edom \([[Gen.36.42|Genesis 36:42]]; [[1Chr.1.53|1 Chronicles 1:53]]\), indicating their prominence and leadership within the Edomite tribal structure. 

The inclusion of Kenaz and the Kenizzites in the genealogy of Esau highlights the development and growth of the Edomite people, who were the descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother. 

Apart from these genealogical mentions, no further information is provided about the specific history, territory, or activities of the Kenizzite clan in the Bible.
