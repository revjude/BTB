Shishak, also known as Sheshonk I, was an Egyptian Pharaoh who ruled during the 10th century BC. He is mentioned in [[1Kgs.11.40|1 Kings 11:40]], 14:25, and [[2Chr.12.2|2 Chronicles 12:2]]-9 in connection with his invasion of Judah during the reign of King Rehoboam, the son of Solomon. When Jeroboam, Solomon's servant, rebelled against Rehoboam, he fled to Egypt and found refuge under Shishak's protection. In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign, Shishak attacked Jerusalem with a vast army, capturing fortified cities in Judah. He seized treasures from the temple and the royal palace, including gold shields that Solomon had made. Rehoboam humbled himself before the Lord, and God granted Judah deliverance from complete destruction. However, they became subject to Shishak, and Rehoboam had to replace the gold shields with bronze ones. Shishak's invasion significantly weakened Judah's power and wealth, marking a decline from the prosperous reign of Solomon. Historically, Shishak is identified with Sheshonk I, the founder of the 22nd Dynasty of Egypt, and his invasion of Judah is confirmed by archaeological evidence, including a relief at the Karnak Temple in Egypt that lists numerous places he conquered, including many in Israel and Judah.
