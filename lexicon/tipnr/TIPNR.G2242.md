- only referred to as Heli<[[G2242]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ἡλί</span>\); 
- a son of Matthat<[[G3158G]]>; 
-  father of Mary<[[G3137G]]> and Salome<[[G4539]]>\(?\).

Heli is mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus Christ in the Gospel of Luke. He is identified as the father of Mary, the mother of Jesus, and thus, the maternal grandfather of Jesus \([[Luke.3.23|Luk.3.23]]\). In the genealogy, Luke traces Jesus' lineage back to Adam through his mother Mary's side of the family, while Matthew's genealogy \(Matt.1.1-17\) follows Joseph's lineage. The mention of Heli provides insight into Jesus' family background and affirms his connection to the Davidic line through his mother. No further information is given about Heli in the Bible. \([[Luke.3.23|Luk.3.23]]\).
