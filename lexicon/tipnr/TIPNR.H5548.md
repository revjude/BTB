Salecah, also known as Salchah or Salcah, was a city located in the region of Bashan, east of the Jordan River. It was part of the kingdom of Og, the Amorite king of Bashan, who was defeated by the Israelites under Moses' leadership \(Deut. 3:10; Josh. 12:5\). After the conquest of Bashan, Salecah was allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh \(Josh. 13:11\). The city is also mentioned in the description of the territory of Gad, where it is said that the Gadites lived in the land of Bashan as far as Salecah \(1 Chr. 5:11\). The exact location of Salecah is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the modern-day Hauran region of Syria, east of the Sea of Galilee.
