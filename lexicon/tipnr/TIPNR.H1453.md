Gederothaim is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Josh.15.36|Joshua 15:36]], as part of the list of towns allotted to the tribe of Judah in the Shephelah, or lowland region. It is listed alongside other towns such as Shaaraim, Adithaim, and Gederah. 

The name "Gederothaim" is derived from the Hebrew word "geder," meaning "wall" or "fence," with the dual ending "-aim," indicating that the town may have consisted of two parts or had a double wall. 

Apart from its inclusion in the list of allotted towns, no other information about Gederothaim is provided in the Bible. Its mention serves to delineate the extent of Judah's territory and to emphasize the thoroughness of the allotment process. 

The exact location of Gederothaim is unknown, but based on its association with the Shephelah and its proximity to other towns mentioned in the same list, it is believed to have been situated in the western foothills of Judah, southwest of Jerusalem. 

The lack of further biblical references to Gederothaim suggests that it may have been a relatively small or less significant settlement compared to other towns in the region. However, its inclusion in the allotment list underscores the importance of each town, regardless of size, in the distribution of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel.
