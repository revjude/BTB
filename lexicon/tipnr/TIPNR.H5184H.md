Nahath is mentioned in [[2Chr.31.13|2 Chronicles 31:13]] as one of the Levites who served during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. He was appointed by the king to oversee the distribution of the offerings, tithes, and dedicated gifts brought to the Temple in Jerusalem. 

During Hezekiah's reign, the king initiated a series of religious reforms aimed at restoring proper worship and adherence to the laws of Moses. As part of these reforms, Hezekiah ordered the collection and distribution of tithes and offerings to support the priests and Levites, ensuring that they could devote themselves to their religious duties. 

Nahath, along with several other Levites, was entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing the storehouses where the offerings were kept and managing the distribution of these resources to the priests and their families. This task required integrity, organization, and fairness to ensure that all the priests and Levites received their rightful share. 

The mention of Nahath in this context highlights the importance of the Levites' role in maintaining the Temple's functions and the significance of proper resource management within the religious community. It also demonstrates King Hezekiah's commitment to restoring and supporting the religious institutions of Judah.
