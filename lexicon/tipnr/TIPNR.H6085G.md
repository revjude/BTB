- A man living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.23.8|Gen.23.8]]; 
- only referred to as Ephron **<big>[[H6085|עֶפְרוֹן]]</big>**; 
- a son of Zohar **<big>[[H6714|צֹחַר]]</big>**.

Ephron was a Hittite man who lived in the city of Hebron during the time of Abraham. He owned a field containing the cave of Machpelah, which Abraham sought to purchase as a burial place for his wife Sarah \(Gen.23\). 

When Sarah died, Abraham approached the Hittites and requested to buy a burial site. Ephron was present at the meeting and offered to give the field and the cave to Abraham as a gift \([[Gen.23.8|Gen.23.8]]-11\). However, Abraham insisted on paying the full price, and Ephron named a price of 400 shekels of silver \([[Gen.23.14|Gen.23.14]]-15\). 

Abraham agreed to the price and paid Ephron in the presence of witnesses, securing the field and the cave as a permanent possession for burial \(Gen.23.16-20\). The cave of Machpelah later became the burial place for Abraham himself, as well as Isaac, Rebekah, Israel \(or 'Jacob'\), and Leah \([[Gen.25.9|Gen.25.9]]; 49.29,30; 50.13\). 

Ephron's interaction with Abraham demonstrates the legal and social customs of property transactions in the ancient Near East. It also highlights Abraham's desire to establish a permanent burial place for his family in the land of Canaan, foreshadowing the future possession of the land by his descendants.
