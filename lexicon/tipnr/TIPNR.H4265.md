Mahaneh-dan, meaning "camp of Dan," was a place located between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tribal territory of Dan. It is mentioned twice in the book of Judges. In [[Judg.13.25|Judges 13:25]], it is described as the place where the Spirit of the Lord began to stir Samson, the legendary Israelite judge and warrior. Later, in [[Judg.18.12|Judges 18:12]], Mahaneh-dan is mentioned as the place where the Danites camped during their migration northward to seek new territory. The exact location of Mahaneh-dan is not specified in the Bible, but it was situated in the area inhabited by the tribe of Dan.
