Hod is mentioned in [[1Chr.7.37|1 Chronicles 7:37]] as one of the descendants of Asher, the eighth son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\). He is listed in the genealogy of the tribe of Asher, which is one of the twelve tribes of Israel. 

In the genealogy, Hod is identified as the son of Shamma, who was the son of Zophah, who was the son of Helem, who was the son of Beriah, who was the son of Asher. 

No other information is provided about Hod in the Bible, apart from his mention in this genealogy. The purpose of the genealogies in Chronicles was to establish the lineage and inheritance rights of the tribes and families of Israel, particularly in relation to their roles in religious and political leadership. 

As a descendant of Asher, Hod would have been part of the tribe that settled in the coastal region of Canaan, north of Mount Carmel, after the Israelites conquered the Promised Land under the leadership of Joshua.
