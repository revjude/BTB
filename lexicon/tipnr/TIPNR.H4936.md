Misham is a name that appears in [[1Chr.8.12|1 Chronicles 8:12]], in the context of a genealogy of the tribe of Benjamin. He is listed as one of the sons of Elpaal, along with his brothers Eber, Shemed, Beriah, and Shema. The genealogy traces the descendants of Benjamin, providing insight into the family lines and individuals within the tribe. 

Beyond being mentioned as a son of Elpaal, no further details are given about Misham's life, actions, or role within the tribe. His inclusion in the genealogy suggests that he was a recognized member of the Benjamite community and that his lineage was considered significant enough to be recorded in the biblical text. However, the lack of additional information about him leaves much of his personal story and contributions unknown.
