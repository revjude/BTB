In the Bible, the East is a direction that is often associated with invading armies and nomadic tribes. In the book of Judges, the Midianites, Amalekites, and other eastern peoples are described as invading Israel, coming from the East with their livestock and tents \([[Judg.6.3|Judges 6:3]], 33; 7:12; 8:10\). These invasions were a recurring problem for the Israelites during the time of the judges. In the book of Ezekiel, the East is mentioned in the context of God's judgment against the Ammonites and Moabites, who were located east of Israel \([[Ezek.25.4|Ezekiel 25:4]], 10\). The East was also the direction from which the Babylonians and Persians came to conquer and exile the people of Judah. In a broader sense, the East represented the vast desert regions and the nomadic tribes that inhabited them, often seen as a source of danger and instability for the settled populations of Israel and Judah.
