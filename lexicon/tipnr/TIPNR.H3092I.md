Jehoshaphat was the son of Asa and became king of Judah at the age of 35. He reigned for 25 years in Jerusalem. Jehoshaphat did what was right in the eyes of the Lord and followed the ways of his father Asa. He removed the high places and Asherah poles from Judah and sent officials to teach the Book of the Law throughout the land. Jehoshaphat became very wealthy and held great honor. He allied himself with Ahab, king of Israel, through marriage and military campaigns. After a prophet rebuked him for helping the wicked Ahab, Jehoshaphat continued to seek the Lord. When faced with a vast army of Moabites, Ammonites, and Meunites, Jehoshaphat prayed for deliverance, and the Lord caused the enemy forces to destroy each other. He enjoyed peace for the remainder of his reign. Jehoshaphat died and was buried in the City of David, and his son Jehoram succeeded him as king.
