The daughter of Sanballat is mentioned in [[Neh.13.28|Nehemiah 13:28]] as being married to a grandson of the high priest Eliashib. Sanballat was the governor of Samaria and an opponent of Nehemiah's efforts to rebuild Jerusalem. This marriage between a member of the high priestly family and the daughter of a prominent adversary was considered a serious breach of the covenant and a defilement of the priesthood. Nehemiah took decisive action by driving the offending priest away from Jerusalem.
