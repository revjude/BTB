- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Esth.9.9|Act.19.29]]; 
- only referred to as Aristarchus **<big>[[G0708|Ἀρίσταρχος]]</big>**.

Aristarchus was a Macedonian Christian from Thessalonica who became a close companion and fellow worker of the apostle Paul. He is mentioned several times in the New Testament, providing insight into his dedication to the gospel and his support of Paul's ministry. 

In Acts 19:29, during the riot in Ephesus, Aristarchus and Gaius are described as Paul's traveling companions who were seized by the mob. This incident highlights the dangers faced by early Christians as they spread the gospel message. 

Aristarchus is later mentioned as one of the delegates who accompanied Paul on his journey to Jerusalem \(Acts 20:4\), demonstrating his commitment to supporting Paul and the church. In Acts 27:2, we learn that Aristarchus was also with Paul during his voyage to Rome as a prisoner, further emphasizing his loyalty and willingness to face hardships for the sake of the gospel. 

In Paul's letters, Aristarchus is described as a fellow prisoner \(Col. 4:10\) and a fellow worker \(Phm. 1:24\). These references suggest that Aristarchus not only traveled with Paul but also shared in his sufferings and labored alongside him in ministry. 

Aristarchus' consistent presence in Paul's life, from his missionary journeys to his imprisonment, testifies to his unwavering faith and dedication to the spread of the gospel. His example serves as an encouragement to believers to remain faithful and committed to serving Christ, even in the face of adversity.
