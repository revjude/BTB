Asenath was an Egyptian woman who became the wife of Joseph, the son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\), during his rise to power in Egypt. She was the daughter of Potiphera, a priest of On \(Heliopolis\), and was given to Joseph by Pharaoh as a wife when he was appointed as the second-in-command over Egypt. Asenath bore Joseph two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, who would later become the patriarchs of two of the twelve tribes of Israel. As the wife of Joseph and the mother of two important tribal leaders, Asenath played a significant role in the history of Israel, despite her Egyptian background.
