- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Rom.16.14|Rom.16.14]]; 
- only referred to as Asyncritus<[[G0799]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ἀσύγκριτος</span>\).

Asyncritus was a Christian living in Rome at the time when Paul wrote his epistle to the Romans. In the final chapter of the epistle, Paul sends greetings to various individuals in the Roman church, including Asyncritus. The mention of Asyncritus, along with other believers such as Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, and Hermas, suggests that he was a member of the Christian community in Rome and likely known to Paul or his associates. The inclusion of these personal greetings demonstrates Paul's care for the members of the church and his desire to foster unity and love among believers.
