Machbannai was a Gadite warrior who joined David at Ziklag, along with several other warriors from the tribe of Gad \(1Ch.12.8-13\). The Gadites are described as brave warriors, trained for battle and skilled with the shield and spear \(1Ch.12.8\). Machbannai and his fellow Gadites defected to David during the time when he was fleeing from King Saul and seeking refuge in the wilderness \(1Sa.22.1-2\). The support of these warriors was crucial for David as he navigated the challenges of this period and eventually established his kingdom. Machbannai's presence among David's supporters demonstrates the loyalty and military prowess that David inspired among his followers.
