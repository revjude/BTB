Jeroham is mentioned in 1 Samuel and 1 Chronicles as an Ephraimite, the father of Elkanah and grandfather of the prophet Samuel. He was from the hill country of Ephraim and was a descendant of Kohath, one of the sons of Levi. Jeroham's son Elkanah was married to Hannah, who prayed for a child and dedicated her son Samuel to serve in the tabernacle. Jeroham's lineage is significant, as it establishes Samuel's Levitical heritage and his family's connection to the priestly line.
