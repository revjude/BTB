Happizzez is mentioned in [[1Chr.24.15|1 Chronicles 24:15]] as the head of the 18th division of priests during the time of King David. David, along with Zadok and Ahimelech, organized the priests into 24 divisions to ensure a systematic and orderly service in the temple \(1 Chronicles 24:1-19\). Each division was responsible for serving in the temple for a specific period, and the order was determined by casting lots. Happizzez was chosen as the head of the 18th division, which would have been responsible for serving during their allotted time. The organization of the priesthood into divisions helped maintain a continuous and efficient service in the temple, ensuring that the priestly duties were carried out according to the prescribed order. The mention of Happizzez in this context highlights the importance of structure and organization within the priestly system.
