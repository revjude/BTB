Sidon is mentioned in [[Gen.10.15|Genesis 10:15]] and [[1Chr.1.13|1 Chronicles 1:13]] as the firstborn son of Canaan, who was the son of Ham and the grandson of Noah. Sidon is listed among the descendants of Canaan, along with his brothers Heth, the Jebusite, the Amorite, and others. The descendants of Canaan inhabited the region that later became known as Canaan, which included the cities of Sidon and Tyre. The Sidonians, who were descended from Sidon, became known for their maritime trade and their skilled craftsmanship, particularly in the production of purple dye and glass. The city of Sidon, named after its ancestor, became one of the most important Phoenician cities and is frequently mentioned in the Bible as a center of commerce and culture.
