Assir was a Levite, the son of Korah and great-grandson of Kohath. He is mentioned in the genealogies of the Levites in Exodus 6 and 1 Chronicles 6. Assir belonged to the Kohathite clan, which was responsible for carrying the most sacred items of the tabernacle during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness. The Kohathites, including Assir's family, were given specific duties in the care and transportation of the holy objects. As a descendant of Levi through Kohath and Korah, Assir was part of a lineage that played a significant role in the religious life of ancient Israel.
