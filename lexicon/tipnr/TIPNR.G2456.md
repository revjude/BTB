<small>*Female • A Christian woman greeted by Paul in Romans*</small>

Woman living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Julia</span>, along with Philologus and Nereus, was greeted by Paul in his letter to the Romans.
- A woman living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Rom.16.15|Rom.16.15]]; 
- only referred to as Julia **<big>[[G2456|Ἰουλία]]</big>**.

Julia is mentioned in [[Rom.16.15|Romans 16:15]] as one of the individuals greeted by Paul in his letter to the church in Rome. The context of the passage is the final chapter of Romans, where Paul extends personal greetings to various members of the Roman church \(Romans 16:1-16\). 

In his greeting, Paul mentions Julia along with Philologus, Nereus, and his sister, as well as all the saints who are with them \([[Rom.16.15|Romans 16:15]]\). This suggests that Julia was part of a group of believers who were closely associated, possibly as members of a house church or a fellowship group within the larger Roman church. 

The fact that Julia is mentioned by name indicates that she was known to Paul and played a role in the Christian community in Rome. However, no further details are provided about her background, occupation, or specific contributions to the church. 

The inclusion of Julia in Paul's greetings underscores the importance of personal relationships and the recognition of individual believers within the early church. It also highlights the presence of women in the early Christian community and their active participation in the life and ministry of the church. 

Apart from this brief mention in Paul's letter, no other information about Julia is found in the Bible.
