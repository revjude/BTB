Hathach was a eunuch who served in the court of King Ahasuerus \(Xerxes I\) of Persia during the time of Queen Esther. He is mentioned in the book of Esther as a messenger between Esther and her cousin Mordecai. When Mordecai learned of a plot to destroy the Jews, he sent word to Esther through Hathach, urging her to intervene with the king on behalf of her people. Hathach faithfully delivered messages between Esther and Mordecai, playing a crucial role in the communication that ultimately led to the deliverance of the Jews from Haman's evil plan. \([[Esth.4.5|Est.4.5]],6,9,10\).
