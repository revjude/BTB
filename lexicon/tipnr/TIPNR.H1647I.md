Gershom is mentioned briefly in [[Ezra.8.2|Ezra 8:2]] as one of the descendants of Phinehas who returned to Jerusalem with Ezra after the Babylonian exile. Phinehas was a son of Eleazar and a grandson of Aaron, the first high priest of Israel. As a descendant of Phinehas, Gershom would have been part of the priestly lineage. Ezra, a priest and scribe, led a group of Israelites back to Jerusalem in the 5th century BC, during the reign of the Persian king Artaxerxes. The purpose of this return was to reestablish Jewish worship and law in the land of Judah. The mention of Gershom and other descendants of prominent priestly families joining Ezra's mission highlights the importance of restoring the priesthood and religious practices in post-exilic Judah.
