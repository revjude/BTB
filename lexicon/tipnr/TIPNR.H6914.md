Kibroth-hattaavah, which means "graves of craving," was a place where the Israelites camped during their wilderness journey after leaving Mount Sinai \([[Num.33.16|Numbers 33:16]]-17\). At this location, the people complained about the lack of meat and expressed their desire to return to Egypt \(Numbers 11:4-6\). In response to their complaint, God sent quail for the people to eat. However, while the meat was still between their teeth, God struck them with a severe plague, and many died \(Numbers 11:31-34\). The place was named Kibroth-hattaavah because of the graves of those who had craved meat. Moses later reminded the Israelites of this incident as an example of their rebellion against God \(Deuteronomy 9:22\). The exact location of Kibroth-hattaavah in the Sinai Peninsula is unknown.
