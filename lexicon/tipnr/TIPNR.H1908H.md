- An Edomite king living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.36.39|Gen.36.39]];

Hadad, also referred to as Hadar in some passages, was the last king of Edom mentioned in the Bible before the Israelites established their own monarchy \([[Gen.36.39|Genesis 36:39]], [[1Chr.1.50|1 Chronicles 1:50]]-51\). He was the successor of Baal-hanan, son of Achbor. Hadad's wife was Mehetabel, daughter of Matred and granddaughter of Me-zahab. The city where Hadad reigned was Pau, but its exact location is unknown. The mention of Hadad as the last king suggests that after his reign, Edom came under the rule of the Israelites.
