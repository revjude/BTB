Shabbethai, mentioned in [[Neh.8.7|Nehemiah 8:7]], was a Levite who played a role in the public reading and explanation of the Law during the time of Ezra and Nehemiah. After the completion of the wall of Jerusalem, the people gathered in the square before the Water Gate, and Ezra the scribe read aloud from the Book of the Law of Moses. Shabbethai, along with several other Levites, helped to explain the Law to the people, making its meaning clear and providing instruction. This event marked a significant moment of spiritual renewal and recommitment to God's commandments among the returned exiles. Shabbethai's involvement highlights the important role of the Levites in teaching and interpreting the Law for the people.
