Rachel was the daughter of Laban and the younger sister of Leah \([[Gen.29.16|Genesis 29:16]]\). She became the beloved wife of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\), who worked for Laban for fourteen years to marry her \(Genesis 29:18-30\). Rachel was initially unable to conceive, while Leah bore several children \([[Gen.29.31|Genesis 29:31]]-35\). In her distress, Rachel gave her maidservant Bilhah to Jacob, and Bilhah bore Dan and Naphtali \([[Gen.30.1|Genesis 30:1]]-8\). Eventually, God remembered Rachel, and she gave birth to Joseph \([[Gen.30.2|Genesis 30:2]]2-24\). When Jacob left Laban, Rachel stole her father's household idols \([[Gen.31.19|Genesis 31:19]]\). She later hid them and deceived her father when he came searching for them \([[Gen.31.34|Genesis 31:34]]-35\). As Jacob's family journeyed to Ephrath \(Bethlehem\), Rachel went into labor and gave birth to Benjamin, but she died during childbirth \([[Gen.35.16|Genesis 35:16]]-20\). Jacob buried her on the way to Ephrath and set up a pillar on her grave \([[Gen.35.20|Genesis 35:20]]\). Rachel's sons, Joseph and Benjamin, became two of the twelve tribes of Israel \([[Gen.46.19|Genesis 46:19]]-22\). Her tomb became a landmark \([[1Sam.10.2|1 Samuel 10:2]]\) and is mentioned in [[Jer.31.15|Jeremiah 31:15]], where her weeping is used as a symbol for Israel's mourning during the Babylonian exile. This passage is also quoted in [[Matt.2.18|Matthew 2:18]] in relation to Herod's massacre of the innocents.
