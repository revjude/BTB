Ecbatana, also known as Achmetha, was an ancient city located in Media, a region in present-day Iran. It served as the capital of the Median Empire and later as a summer residence for Persian kings. In the biblical context, Ecbatana is mentioned in the book of Ezra as the place where a significant scroll was discovered during the reign of King Darius I of Persia \([[Ezra.6.2|Ezra 6:2]]\). The scroll contained a decree issued by King Cyrus, allowing the Jews to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem and authorizing the use of royal funds to support the project. This discovery provided crucial evidence and support for the Jews in their efforts to restore the Temple and re-establish their religious practices in Jerusalem. Ecbatana's mention in the Bible highlights the city's importance as an administrative center and repository of official documents during the Persian period.
