Pamphylia was a Roman province located on the southern coast of Asia Minor \(modern-day Turkey\). It is mentioned several times in the New Testament, particularly in connection with Paul's missionary journeys. On the day of Pentecost, Jews from Pamphylia were among those present in Jerusalem who heard the apostles speaking in their own languages \(Acts 2:10\). 

During Paul's first missionary journey, he and Barnabas traveled to Perga in Pamphylia, where John Mark left them to return to Jerusalem \(Acts 13:13\). Later, Paul and Barnabas passed through Pamphylia again on their way to Antioch \(Acts 14:24\). In his second missionary journey, Paul chose not to take John Mark with him because he had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia \(Acts 15:38\). 

The province of Pamphylia was known for its coastal cities, such as Perga and Attalia \(modern-day Antalya\), which served as important centers for trade and commerce. The region was also known for its rugged terrain, with the Taurus Mountains running through the northern part of the province.
