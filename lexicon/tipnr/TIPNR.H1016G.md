Beth-dagon, meaning "house of Dagon" in Hebrew, was a town allotted to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land. It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Josh.15.41|Joshua 15:41]], as part of a list of towns in the lowland region of Judah, known as the Shephelah. 

The name Beth-dagon suggests that the town was associated with the worship of Dagon, a Philistine deity often depicted as having the upper body of a man and the tail of a fish. Dagon was considered the god of fertility, agriculture, and storms. The Philistines believed that Dagon had granted them victory over the Israelites and captured the Ark of the Covenant \(1 Samuel 5:1-7\). 

The presence of a town named after Dagon within Judah's territory indicates the influence of Philistine culture and religion in the region. It is not uncommon for towns and cities in the ancient Near East to be named after the deities worshipped there. 

The exact location of Beth-dagon is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in the western part of Judah, near the Philistine border.
