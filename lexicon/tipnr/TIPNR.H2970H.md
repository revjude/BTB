Jaazaniah, the son of Shaphan, is mentioned in [[Ezek.8.11|Ezekiel 8:11]] as one of the seventy elders of Israel who were involved in idolatrous practices within the temple. In a vision, God shows Ezekiel the various forms of idolatry being practiced by the people of Judah, even within the sacred precincts of the temple \(Ezk.8.5-18\). 

Ezekiel sees seventy elders, including Jaazaniah, standing in a room filled with idolatrous images and burning incense \(Ezk.8.10-11\). These elders were engaging in pagan worship practices, believing that God had forsaken them and that He could not see their actions \(Ezk.8.12\). 

Jaazaniah's father, Shaphan, was a prominent figure during the reign of King Josiah, known for his role in the discovery of the Book of the Law and the subsequent religious reforms \(2Ki.22.3-14\). The fact that Jaazaniah, the son of such a notable figure, was involved in idolatry highlights the extent of Judah's spiritual decline. 

The inclusion of Jaazaniah in this vision serves to demonstrate the corruption and unfaithfulness of Judah's leadership, who had turned away from God and embraced pagan practices. It also underscores the severity of Judah's sin and the justification for God's impending judgment upon the nation.
