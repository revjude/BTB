Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Sotai</span> was the ancestor of a family of Solomon's servants who were among the exiles that returned to Jerusalem from Babylon.
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.55|Ezr.2.55]]; 
- only referred to as Sotai<[[H5479]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>סו</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ט</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>\).

Sotai is mentioned in [[Ezra.2.55|Ezra 2:55]] and [[Neh.7.57|Nehemiah 7:57]] as the ancestor of a family of Solomon's servants who were among the exiles that returned to Jerusalem from Babylon. Solomon's servants were a group of people who were assigned to work for King Solomon and his descendants, possibly as craftsmen, laborers, or officials. 

The descendants of Sotai are listed among the exiles who returned to Jerusalem under the leadership of Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, and Jeshua, the high priest. This return took place around 538 BC, after the Persian king Cyrus issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to their homeland and rebuild the temple in Jerusalem. 

The mention of Sotai and his descendants in the lists of returning exiles highlights the importance of maintaining family records and genealogies among the Israelites, even during the Babylonian captivity. It also shows that not only the prominent families but also the servants and workers were included in the return to Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the Jewish community.
