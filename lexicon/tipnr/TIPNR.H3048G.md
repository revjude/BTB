- A priest from the tribe of Levi  living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[1Chr.9.10|1Ch.9.10]]; 
- only referred to as Jedaiah **<big>[[H3048|יְדַעְיָה]]</big>**; 
- a son of Joiarib **<big>[[H3114|יוֹיָרִיב]]</big>**.

Jedaiah is mentioned in [[1Chr.9.10|1 Chronicles 9:10]], [[Neh.11.10|Nehemiah 11:10]], and [[Neh.12.6|Nehemiah 12:6]],19 as a priest who returned to Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. In 1 Chronicles 9 and Nehemiah 11, he is listed among the priests who settled in Jerusalem, indicating his role in reestablishing the temple worship and the spiritual life of the community. [[Neh.12.6|Nehemiah 12:6]] identifies him as one of the priests who returned with Zerubbabel, the first group of exiles to return to Jerusalem. In [[Neh.12.19|Nehemiah 12:19]], Jedaiah is mentioned as the head of a priestly family during the time of Joiakim, the high priest. These references suggest that Jedaiah and his descendants played a significant role in the priestly duties and the restoration of temple worship in the post-exilic period.
