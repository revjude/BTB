Perez-uzza, meaning "the breach of Uzzah," was the name given to the place where Uzzah, one of the men accompanying the Ark of the Covenant, was struck down by God \(1 Chr. 13:11\). During the reign of King David, the Ark was being transported from Kiriath-jearim to Jerusalem on a new cart. When the oxen stumbled near the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the Ark, touching it in the process. As a result, the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah, and God struck him down for his irreverence \(1 Chr. 13:9-10\). 

David was both afraid and angry because of this incident, and he named the place Perez-uzza. The event caused David to fear the Lord and question how he could bring the Ark to Jerusalem \(1 Chr. 13:12\). The Ark was then taken to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite, where it remained for three months, bringing blessings to Obed-edom's household \(1 Chr. 13:13-14\). 

The incident at Perez-uzza highlights the sacredness of the Ark of the Covenant and the importance of handling holy objects with reverence and according to divine instructions. It also demonstrates God's holiness and the consequences of irreverence or disobedience.
