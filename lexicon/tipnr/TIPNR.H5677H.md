Eber is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.5.13|1 Chronicles 5:13]] as one of the chiefs of the Gadites during the reign of Jotham, king of Judah. He is listed along with his brothers Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jachan, Zia, and Heber. 

The Gadites were one of the Israelite tribes that settled east of the Jordan River, in the region of Gilead. They were known for their military prowess and often assisted the other tribes in battles against their enemies. 

The mention of Eber and his brothers as chiefs suggests that they held positions of leadership and authority within the tribe of Gad during the reign of King Jotham, who ruled Judah from approximately 750 to 735 BC. Jotham was known for his righteous reign and for his building projects, including the construction of the Upper Gate of the House of the Lord \(2 Chronicles 27:3\). 

Apart from this brief mention in the genealogy, no further information is provided about Eber or his specific role as a chief of the Gadites. His inclusion in the list highlights the importance of family lineage and tribal leadership in ancient Israelite society.
