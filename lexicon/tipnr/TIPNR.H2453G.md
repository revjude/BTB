People from Hachmon or Tahchemon\(?\)

The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Hachmonites</span>, also known as the Tahchemonites, were a clan or family that produced some of David's mighty warriors.
- People from Hachmon or Tahchemon\(?\), first mentioned at [[2Sam.23.8|2Sa.23.8]]; 
- referred to as Hachmonites **<big>[[H2453|חַכְמוֹנִי]]</big>**, or Tahchemonite \(KJV= Tachmonite, NIV= Tahkemonite\)  **<big>[[H8461|תַּחְכְּמֹנִי]]</big>**.

The Hachmonites, also referred to as the Tahchemonites, were a clan or family mentioned in the context of King David's mighty warriors. In [[2Sam.23.8|2 Samuel 23:8]], Josheb-Basshebeth, one of David's mighty men, is called the Tahchemonite, which suggests that he may have been a member of this clan. Similarly, in [[1Chr.11.11|1 Chronicles 11:11]], Jashobeam, another of David's mighty warriors, is described as the son of a Hachmonite. These references indicate that the Hachmonites or Tahchemonites were known for producing skilled and valiant warriors who served in David's army. However, no further details are provided about the history or origins of this clan in the Bible.
