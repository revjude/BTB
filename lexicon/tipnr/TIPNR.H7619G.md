Shebuel \(or Shubael\), mentioned in [[1Chr.23.16|1 Chronicles 23:16]], 26:24, and 24:20, was a Levite who descended from Gershom, one of the sons of Levi. He played a significant role in the organization of the Levitical duties during the reign of King David. In [[1Chr.23.16|1 Chronicles 23:16]], Shebuel is identified as the son of Gershom and the head of the fathers' houses of the Levites. Later, in [[1Chr.26.24|1 Chronicles 26:24]], Shebuel is appointed by David to be in charge of the treasuries of the house of God, which included the dedicated gifts and offerings. This responsibility highlights Shebuel's trustworthiness and administrative skills in managing the temple's resources. In 1 Chronicles 24:20, Shebuel is mentioned again as a descendant of Gershom, emphasizing his Levitical lineage. The text does not provide any further details about Shebuel's life or specific achievements. However, his appointment to oversee the treasuries of the temple demonstrates the importance of the Levites' role in maintaining and managing the sacred spaces and resources dedicated to God.
