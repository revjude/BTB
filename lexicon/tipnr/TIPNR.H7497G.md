The Valley of Rephaim, also known as the Valley of the Giants, was a fertile valley located southwest of Jerusalem, near the border between Judah and Benjamin \(Jos. 15:8; 18:16\). It was the site of two significant battles between David and the Philistines \(2 Sa. 5:18, 22; 23:13; 1 Ch. 11:15; 14:9\). In one instance, David and his men were hiding in a cave near the Philistine camp in the Valley of Rephaim when three of his mighty men risked their lives to bring him water from the well at Bethlehem \(2 Sa. 23:13; 1 Ch. 11:15\). The valley is also mentioned figuratively in [[Isa.17.5|Isaiah 17:5]], comparing the harvest of Israel to the gathering of grain in the Valley of Rephaim.
