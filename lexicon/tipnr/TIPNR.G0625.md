- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[1Sam.9.1|Act.18.24]]; 
- only referred to as Apollos<[[G0625]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ἀπολλῶς</span>\).

Apollos was a prominent Jewish Christian from Alexandria, known for his eloquence, knowledge of the Scriptures, and effectiveness in preaching the gospel. He is first mentioned in the book of Acts as a learned man who spoke with great fervor and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John. After receiving further instruction from Priscilla and Aquila in Ephesus, Apollos went to Achaia and greatly helped the believers there, vigorously refuting the Jews in public debate and proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah. 

In Paul's first letter to the Corinthians, Apollos is mentioned as one of the leaders that some of the Corinthian believers were aligning themselves with, alongside Paul and Cephas \(Peter\). Paul clarifies that both he and Apollos are merely servants through whom the Corinthians came to believe, each serving the role God had assigned to them. Paul planted, Apollos watered, but God made it grow. Paul also mentions Apollos as a positive example when discussing the need for humility and unity among believers. 

Later, in Paul's letter to Titus, Apollos is mentioned again as someone Paul encourages Titus to help on his journey, together with Zenas the lawyer. This suggests that Apollos continued to be actively involved in ministry and was a valued co-worker in spreading the gospel message.
