Patara was a significant port city in the province of Lycia, located on the southwestern coast of modern-day Turkey. It is mentioned in the New Testament in Acts 21:1, which records that Paul, during his third missionary journey, changed ships at Patara while traveling from Rhodes to Tyre on his way to Jerusalem. Patara was known for its temple and oracle of Apollo, as well as its harbor and maritime trade. The city was also famous for its lighthouse, which was one of the most renowned in the ancient world. Although the biblical reference to Patara is brief, it provides insight into the trade routes and transportation methods used by early Christians in the Mediterranean region.
