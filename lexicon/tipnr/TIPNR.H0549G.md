Amana is mentioned in Song of Solomon 4:8 as part of a poetic description of the beloved's beauty. In the verse, the lover invites his beloved to come with him from Lebanon, from the top of Amana, Senir, and Hermon, where lions and leopards dwell. The context suggests that Amana is a mountain range, likely located in the region of Lebanon. 

Some scholars identify Amana with the Anti-Lebanon mountain range, which runs parallel to the Lebanon mountains on the eastern side of the Beqaa Valley. Others associate it with Mount Amanus, a range located in southern Turkey, near the Syrian border. The exact identification remains uncertain. 

The mention of Amana in the Song of Solomon is part of a literary device that uses geographical references to emphasize the beauty and desirability of the beloved. By associating her with the grandeur and majesty of the mountains, the lover expresses his admiration and love for her.
