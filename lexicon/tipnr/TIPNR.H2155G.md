Zimmah was a Levite mentioned in the genealogies of the Gershonites in 1 Chronicles 6. He was the son of Shimei and is listed among the descendants of Gershon, one of the three main divisions of the Levites. The Gershonites were responsible for the care and transportation of the tabernacle curtains, coverings, and related items during the Israelites' wilderness wanderings. In the organization of the Levitical duties during the time of King David, the Gershonites were given specific roles in the service of the tabernacle and, later, the temple. The mention of Zimmah in the genealogical record highlights the importance of the Levitical lineage and their assigned duties in maintaining the worship practices of ancient Israel. However, no further details are provided about Zimmah's specific role or contributions within the Gershonite clan.
