Bilhan was a descendant of Esau, brother of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\)'s brother, and one of the chiefs of Edom \(Gen. 36:27; 1 Ch. 1:42\). Esau, also known as Edom, settled in the hill country of Seir and became the ancestor of the Edomites \(Gen. 36:8-9\). The Edomites were the southeastern neighbors of the Israelites and were known for their wisdom and military prowess \(Jer. 49:7; Obad. 1:8-9\). Bilhan's mention as a chief suggests that he held a position of authority and leadership among the Edomites. The listing of Edomite chiefs in Genesis and Chronicles demonstrates the political and social organization of Edom and its development as a nation distinct from Israel.
