Dodo, son of Puah, is mentioned in [[Judg.10.1|Judges 10:1]] as a judge of Israel who succeeded Abimelech. He was from the tribe of Issachar and lived in Shamir, a town in the hill country of Ephraim. 

Dodo judged Israel for 23 years, indicating a period of relative stability and peace following the turbulent reign of Abimelech. The fact that he lived in Ephraim suggests that his influence and leadership extended beyond his own tribe of Issachar. 

The book of Judges records a cyclical pattern of the Israelites falling into sin, being oppressed by foreign nations, crying out to God, and then being delivered by a judge whom God raised up. Dodo's role as a judge would have included providing military leadership, settling disputes, and guiding the people in religious and political matters. 

After Dodo's death, he was buried in Shamir, and the narrative shifts to the next judge, Jair the Gileadite \(Judges 10:2\).
