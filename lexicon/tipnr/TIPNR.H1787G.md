Dishon is mentioned in the genealogies of Esau's family in Genesis 36 and 1 Chronicles 1. He is listed as one of the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land of Edom before Esau's descendants settled there \(Genesis 36:20-21; [[1Chr.1.38|1 Chronicles 1:38]]\). 

Dishon is also identified as the son of Anah \(Genesis 36:25; 1 Chronicles 1:41\). Anah is noteworthy for having discovered hot springs in the wilderness while pasturing donkeys for his father, Zibeon \(Genesis 36:24\). 

Dishon's sons are listed as Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran \([[Gen.36.26|Genesis 36:26]]; 1 Chronicles 1:41\). These genealogies demonstrate the intermingling of Esau's descendants with the Horites, as Esau's grandson, Esau's son Eliphaz's son, was named Dishon \(Genesis 36:25-26\). 

The Horites were the original inhabitants of Mount Seir, the region south of the Dead Sea, before Esau's descendants displaced them \(Deuteronomy 2:12\). The inclusion of Dishon and other Horite names in Esau's genealogy suggests that there was intermarriage between the two groups. 

Apart from these genealogical references, no further information is provided about Dishon or his specific role in the biblical narrative. His mention serves to trace the origins and relationships of the people living in the region of Edom during the time of the patriarchs.
