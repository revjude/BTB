Sabteca is mentioned in [[Gen.10.7|Genesis 10:7]] and [[1Chr.1.9|1 Chronicles 1:9]] as one of the sons of Cush, who was a son of Ham. He is listed among the descendants of Noah's sons in the Table of Nations, which records the dispersal of people groups after the Flood \(Genesis 10:1-32\). The precise identity and location of the People from Sabteca are unknown, but some scholars suggest a connection with the ancient city of Samydake, mentioned by Greek geographer Strabo, which was located on the southern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. Others propose a link with the ancient kingdom of Sabata, located in the same region. However, these associations remain speculative due to the limited information provided in the biblical text. The inclusion of Sabteca in the Table of Nations highlights the diversity of peoples and nations that emerged from the descendants of Noah and their spread across the earth after the Flood.
