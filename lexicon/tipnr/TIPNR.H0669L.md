Ephraim is mentioned in [[John.11.54|John 11:54]] as the place where Jesus withdrew with His disciples after the raising of Lazarus. This event had intensified the opposition of the Jewish religious leaders, who were plotting to kill Jesus \(John 11:45-53\). 

The city of Ephraim was located near the wilderness, likely referring to the Judean wilderness east of Jerusalem. By withdrawing to this area, Jesus sought to avoid confrontation with His enemies until the appointed time for His passion and death. 

The exact location of Ephraim is uncertain, but it may be the same as the city of Ephron mentioned in 2 Chronicles 13:19, which was situated in the hill country of Judah, near Bethel.
