Succoth was the first place the Israelites camped after setting out from Rameses during the Exodus from Egypt \(Exod. 12:37; Num. 33:5\). The name "Succoth" means "booths" or "shelters," possibly referring to temporary structures used by shepherds or farmers. The location of Succoth is not certain, but it was likely situated in the eastern Nile Delta region, possibly near the ancient city of Pithom \(Tell el-Maskhuta\). After leaving Succoth, the Israelites continued their journey and camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness \(Exod. 13:20; Num. 33:6\).
