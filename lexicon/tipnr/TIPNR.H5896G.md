Ira the Jairite served as a priest under King David, according to [[2Sam.20.26|2 Samuel 20:26]]. He is listed among David's officials at the end of a narrative describing the quelling of a rebellion against David. As a Jairite, Ira likely descended from Jair, who was from the tribe of Manasseh \(Num.32.41, Deut.3.14\). The text provides no further details about Ira's specific duties or tenure as a priest under David's reign.
