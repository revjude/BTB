Adramyttium was a seaport on the northwest coast of Asia Minor \(modern-day Turkey\), mentioned in Acts 27:2 in connection with the apostle Paul's journey to Rome as a prisoner. Paul and other prisoners were placed on a ship from Adramyttium, which was about to sail to ports along the coast of Asia Minor. The ship likely followed a common trade route, stopping at various ports to unload and load cargo and passengers. 

Adramyttium was located in the region of Mysia, near the island of Lesbos. It was an important port city in the Roman province of Asia and a center for trade and commerce. The city was known for its shipbuilding industry and its strategic location along the Aegean coast. Apart from its mention in Paul's journey, Adramyttium does not play any other significant role in the biblical narrative. Its inclusion in Acts 27 provides a glimpse into the maritime travel and trade networks of the Roman Empire in the first century AD.
