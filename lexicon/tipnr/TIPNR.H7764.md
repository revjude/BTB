Shuni is mentioned in [[Gen.46.16|Genesis 46:16]] and [[Num.26.15|Numbers 26:15]] as one of the sons of Gad who went down to Egypt with Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and his family. He is listed among the 70 members of Jacob's household who migrated to Egypt during the time of Joseph. In [[Num.26.15|Numbers 26:15]], Shuni is mentioned again in the context of the census taken in the wilderness, where the Shunite clan, descended from Shuni, is counted among the families of Gad. The Shunites were one of the clans that formed the tribe of Gad, which later received its inheritance in the Transjordan region after the Israelites conquered the Promised Land under Joshua's leadership.
