In 1 Chronicles 15, Jehiel is listed among the Levites chosen to play the harp and lyre when the Ark of the Covenant was brought to Jerusalem. He is described as a "second-degree" musician, suggesting a level of skill and experience in his role. In [[1Chr.16.5|1 Chronicles 16:5]], Jehiel is mentioned again as one of the musicians who ministered before the Ark of the Covenant with harps, lyres, and cymbals. This chapter describes the celebration and worship that took place when the Ark was placed in the tent David had prepared for it. Jehiel's inclusion in these passages highlights the importance of music and worship in the religious life of ancient Israel and the significant role played by skilled musicians like Jehiel in the temple service.
