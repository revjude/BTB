Amasai was a chief of thirty mighty men who joined David at Ziklag when he was fleeing from King Saul. When David was in the wilderness, a group of men came to him, and the Spirit came upon Amasai, who was their leader. Amasai pledged his allegiance to David, saying, "We are yours, David! We are with you, son of Jesse! Success, success to you, and success to those who help you, for your God will help you." David received them and made them leaders of his troops.
