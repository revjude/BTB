The Tower of Eder, also known as the Tower of the Flock, is mentioned twice in the Bible. In [[Gen.35.21|Genesis 35:21]], it is recorded that Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) pitched his tent beyond the Tower of Eder after the death of his wife, Rachel. The tower was likely a watchtower used by shepherds to guard their flocks near Bethlehem. In [[Mic.4.8|Micah 4:8]], the prophet addresses the Tower of the Flock, associating it with the coming of the Messiah and the restoration of the kingdom to Jerusalem. This passage has led some interpreters to view the Tower of Eder as a prophetic symbol of the birthplace of the Messiah, linking it to the fields near Bethlehem where the shepherds received the announcement of Jesus' birth \(Luke 2:8-20\). However, the exact location of the tower and its significance in Messianic prophecy remain a matter of interpretation.
