<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Eden</span>, the perfect garden created by God, where He placed Adam and Eve \([[Gen.2.8|Genesis 2:8]], 10, 15; 3:23-24; 4:16; [[Isa.51.3|Isaiah 51:3]]; [[Ezek.28.13|Ezekiel 28:13]]; 31:9, 16, 18; 36:35; Joel 2:3\).
- A location in Mesopotamia\(?\) first mentioned at [[Gen.2.8|Gen.2.8]]; 
- referred to as Eden **<big>[[H5731|עֵדֶן]]</big>**, or Edem **<big>[[H5731|עֵדֶן]]</big>**.

Eden, also known as the Garden of Eden, was the perfect paradise created by God as a dwelling place for the first man and woman, Adam and Eve. It was planted by God in the east \([[Gen.2.8|Genesis 2:8]]\) and was watered by a river that divided into four headwaters \([[Gen.2.10|Genesis 2:10]]\). God placed Adam in the Garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it \([[Gen.2.15|Genesis 2:15]]\). The garden contained various trees, including the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil \(Genesis 2:9\). After Adam and Eve disobeyed God by eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they were expelled from the Garden of Eden \([[Gen.3.23|Genesis 3:23]]-24\). Cherubim and a flaming sword were placed at the east of the garden to guard the way to the tree of life \([[Gen.3.24|Genesis 3:24]]\). The Garden of Eden is mentioned in later biblical passages as a symbol of perfect beauty, abundance, and God's ideal for His creation \([[Isa.51.3|Isaiah 51:3]]; [[Ezek.28.13|Ezekiel 28:13]]; 31:9, 16, 18; 36:35; Joel 2:3\). The exact location of the Garden of Eden is unknown, but it is believed to have been situated in the ancient Near East, possibly in Mesopotamia.
