Manoah was an Israelite from the tribe of Dan, and he was the father of Samson. Manoah's wife was barren, but the Angel of the Lord appeared to her and announced that she would conceive and give birth to a son who would begin to deliver Israel from the Philistines. The Angel instructed her to follow specific guidelines during her pregnancy and to raise the child as a Nazirite. Manoah prayed for the Angel to return and teach them how to raise the child, and the Angel appeared again, reiterating the instructions. Manoah offered a young goat as a sacrifice to the Lord, and the Angel ascended in the flame of the altar, confirming his divine nature. Manoah and his wife named their son Samson, and the Lord blessed him as he grew. After Samson's death, he was buried in the tomb of his father, Manoah, between Zorah and Eshtaol \(Judges 13; 16:31\).
