Marah was a location on the route of the Israelites during their Exodus from Egypt. It was the first camp after crossing the Red Sea \(Exodus 15:22-23; [[Num.33.8|Numbers 33:8]]\). The name Marah means "bitter" because the water there was undrinkable due to its bitterness. The Israelites grumbled against Moses, but the Lord showed him a tree which, when cast into the water, made it sweet \(Exodus 15:24-25\). God then tested the Israelites, promising to protect them from diseases if they obeyed His commands \(Exodus 15:25-26\). After Marah, the Israelites traveled to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees \(Exodus 15:27; [[Num.33.9|Numbers 33:9]]\).
