Adummim was a mountain pass located on the border between the territories of Judah and Benjamin, as described in [[Josh.15.7|Joshua 15:7]] and 18:17. It is situated on the road that goes up from Jericho to Jerusalem, in the wilderness of Judah. The name Adummim means "red" or "ruddy," possibly referring to the reddish color of the rocks or soil in the area. 

In both references, Adummim is mentioned as a point along the boundary line between the two tribes, near the Stone of Bohan \(son of Reuben\) and the Valley of Achor. Its location is generally identified with Tal'at ed-Damm, a steep ascent on the modern Jericho-Jerusalem road, approximately halfway between the two cities. The pass of Adummim was known for its treacherous terrain and its association with robbers, as alluded to in the parable of the Good Samaritan \(Luke 10:30-37\).
