Beten is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Josh.19.25|Joshua 19:25]], as part of the list of towns and territories allotted to the tribe of Asher during the division of the Promised Land under Joshua's leadership. The town is listed along with other cities such as Achshaph, Alammelech, and Amad. The exact location of Beten is not specified in the Bible, but it was within the territory of Asher, which was situated in the northwestern part of Canaan, along the Mediterranean coast.
