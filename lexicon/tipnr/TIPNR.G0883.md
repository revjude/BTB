Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Achaicus</span>, along with Stephanas and Fortunatus, visited Paul from Corinth.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[1Cor.16.17|1Co.16.17]]; 
- only referred to as Achaicus<[[G0883]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ἀχα</span>ϊ<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>κός</span>\).

Achaicus is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[1Cor.16.17|1 Corinthians 16:17]]. He was a member of the Corinthian church who, along with Stephanas and Fortunatus, visited the apostle Paul during his ministry. These three men likely brought news and a letter from the Corinthian church to Paul, as well as supplies and encouragement. 

Paul expresses his joy and refreshment at their arrival, as they filled in for the absence of the Corinthians \(1Co. 16:17-18\). He urges the Corinthian believers to submit to and appreciate such people who serve faithfully.
