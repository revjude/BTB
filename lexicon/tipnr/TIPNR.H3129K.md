In [[Neh.12.35|Nehemiah 12:35]], Jonathan is mentioned as one of the priests who blew trumpets during the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem. This event took place after the Israelites had returned from Babylonian exile and rebuilt the wall under Nehemiah's leadership. The dedication was a joyous occasion, with two large choirs giving thanks and the priests blowing trumpets \(Nehemiah 12:31, 35\). Jonathan's participation as a trumpeter suggests he was a priest serving in Jerusalem at this time, which would have been in the mid-5th century BC under Persian rule.
