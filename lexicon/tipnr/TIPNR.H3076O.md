Jehohanan is mentioned in [[Neh.6.18|Nehemiah 6:18]] as the father-in-law of Tobiah, one of the main opponents of Nehemiah during the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls. Tobiah, along with Sanballat and Geshem, actively tried to hinder and discourage Nehemiah's efforts to reconstruct the city's defenses. The passage notes that many in Judah were bound by oath to Tobiah because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah, son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam, son of Berechiah. These family connections suggest that Tobiah had significant influence and support among some of the Jewish nobles, which made it more difficult for Nehemiah to carry out his mission. The text does not provide any further information about Jehohanan himself, but his relationship to Tobiah and his marriage into another prominent family highlight the complex social and political dynamics that Nehemiah had to navigate during the rebuilding process.
