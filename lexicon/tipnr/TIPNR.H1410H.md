Gad was a prophet who served during the reigns of King David and his son Solomon. He first appears in [[1Sam.22.5|1 Samuel 22:5]], where he advises David to leave his stronghold in Moab and return to the land of Judah. Gad played a significant role in the events surrounding David's census of Israel \(2 Samuel 24; 1 Chronicles 21\). After David had sinned by taking the census, Gad was sent by God to offer David a choice of three punishments: three years of famine, three months of fleeing from enemies, or three days of plague \([[2Sam.24.11|2 Samuel 24:11]]-14; [[1Chr.21.9|1 Chronicles 21:9]]-13\). David chose the plague, and Gad instructed him to build an altar on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite to stop the plague \([[2Sam.24.18|2 Samuel 24:18]]-19; [[1Chr.21.18|1 Chronicles 21:18]]-19\). Gad is described as David's seer \([[2Sam.24.11|2 Samuel 24:11]]; [[1Chr.21.9|1 Chronicles 21:9]]\) and is credited with writing a book about David's acts \([[1Chr.29.29|1 Chronicles 29:29]]\). He was also involved in organizing the music and worship in the tabernacle \([[2Chr.29.25|2 Chronicles 29:25]]\). Gad's ministry as a prophet spanned the latter years of David's reign and continued into the early years of Solomon's reign.
