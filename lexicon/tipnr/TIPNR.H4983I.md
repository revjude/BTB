Mattaniah was a Levite who lived during the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah. He was the grandfather of Jahaziel, a Levite who was filled with the Spirit of the Lord and prophesied before the king and the people of Judah. Jahaziel encouraged Jehoshaphat and the people not to fear the approaching armies of the Moabites, Ammonites, and Meunites, assuring them that the battle belonged to the Lord. As a result, Jehoshaphat and the people worshipped the Lord, and the next day, they witnessed the Lord's deliverance as their enemies turned against each other \([[2Chr.20.14|2 Chronicles 20:14]]-24\). Mattaniah is only mentioned in this context as the father of the prophet Jahaziel.
