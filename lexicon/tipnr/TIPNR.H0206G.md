Aven Valley is mentioned in Amos 1:5 as part of a prophecy against Damascus, the capital of Aram \(Syria\). In this passage, God declares judgment upon Damascus and states that He "will break the gate bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the Valley of Aven." The exact location of the Aven Valley is uncertain, but it was likely a fertile plain near Damascus. The name "Aven" means "wickedness" or "idolatry," possibly indicating that the valley was known for its idolatrous practices. The prophecy suggests that the valley and its inhabitants would be destroyed as part of God's judgment on Damascus.
