Mount Paran is mentioned in two poetic passages in the Old Testament \(Deut. 33:2; Hab. 3:3\). In both instances, it is associated with the appearance or manifestation of God. In the blessing of Moses, God is described as coming from Sinai, rising from Seir, and shining forth from Mount Paran \(Deut. 33:2\). Similarly, in Habakkuk's prayer, God is portrayed as coming from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran \(Hab. 3:3\). 

The exact location of Mount Paran is uncertain, and there is no clear geographical reference to a specific mountain by this name. It is possible that "Mount Paran" is used symbolically or poetically to represent the general region of Paran, emphasizing God's presence and power as He led the Israelites through the wilderness. Some scholars suggest that Mount Paran might be another name for Mount Sinai or a mountain range in the vicinity of the wilderness of Paran.
