Memucan was one of the seven princes of Persia and Media who served as advisors to King Ahasuerus \([[Esth.1.14|Est.1.14]]\). When Queen Vashti refused to appear before the king and his guests during a royal feast, Memucan was the one who advised the king on how to handle the situation \([[Esth.1.16|Est.1.16]]\). He suggested that Vashti's behavior could set a precedent for other women in the kingdom to disrespect their husbands. Memucan proposed that the king issue a decree deposing Vashti and selecting a new queen, to serve as an example to all women to honor their husbands \([[Esth.1.16|Est.1.16]],21\). The king followed Memucan's advice, and Vashti was removed from her position as queen \([[Esth.1.21|Est.1.21]]\).
