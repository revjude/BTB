Parmashta was one of the ten sons of Haman, the enemy of the Jews in the book of Esther \([[Esth.9.9|Esther 9:9]]\). After Haman's plot to destroy the Jews was exposed and he was executed, the king granted the Jews the right to defend themselves against their enemies. On the appointed day, the Jews in Susa, led by Mordecai and Esther, fought against those who sought to harm them. Among those killed were Haman's ten sons, including Parmashta. The deaths of Haman's sons served as a powerful symbol of the complete defeat of the enemies of the Jews and the reversal of Haman's evil plans. The story of Parmashta and his brothers is commemorated during the Jewish festival of Purim, which celebrates the deliverance of the Jews from Haman's plot.
