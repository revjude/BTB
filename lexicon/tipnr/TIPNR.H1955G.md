Hoshaiah is mentioned in [[Neh.12.32|Nehemiah 12:32]] as one of the leaders who participated in the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem. This event took place after the completion of the rebuilding of the city wall under the leadership of Nehemiah. 

During the dedication ceremony, two large choirs were appointed to give thanks and praise to God. They marched in opposite directions on top of the wall, meeting at the Temple. Hoshaiah is listed among the leaders who followed one of the choirs, along with Nehemiah and half of the leaders of Judah \(Nehemiah 12:31-32\). 

The dedication of the wall was a significant moment in the history of Jerusalem, as it marked the restoration of the city's defenses and the renewal of the Jewish community after the Babylonian exile. The participation of leaders like Hoshaiah in this event demonstrates the unity and shared purpose of the people in celebrating God's faithfulness and provision. 

Although no further information is provided about Hoshaiah in the Bible, his presence at the dedication ceremony suggests that he was a respected figure among the leaders of Judah and played a role in the spiritual and social life of the community.
