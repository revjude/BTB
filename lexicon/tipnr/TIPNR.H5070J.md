Man living at the time of United Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Nadab</span> was a son of Abiel, mentioned in the genealogy of the tribe of Benjamin.
- A man from the tribe of Benjamin living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Chr.8.30|1Ch.8.30]]; 
- only referred to as Nadab<[[H5070J]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>\); 
-  son of Abiel<[[H0022G]]> and Maacah<[[H4601N]]>; 
- a brother of Kish<[[H7027G]]>, Ner<[[H5369G]]>, Abdon<[[H5658J]]>, Zur<[[H6698I]]>, Baal<[[H1168B]]>, Gedor<[[H1446I]]>, Ahio<[[H0283I]]>, Zecher<[[H2144]]> and Mikloth<[[H4732G]]>.

Nadab is mentioned in [[1Chr.8.30|1 Chronicles 8:30]] and 9:36 as one of the sons of Abiel, a descendant of Benjamin. These references appear in genealogical records that trace the lineage of the tribe of Benjamin, providing insight into the family lines within the tribe. 

In both passages, Nadab is listed alongside his brothers Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth as the sons of Abiel \([[1Chr.8.30|1 Chronicles 8:30]]; 9:36\). Abiel, also known as Jeiel, is identified as the father of this family and is described as living in Gibeon, a city within the territory of Benjamin \(1 Chronicles 9:35\). The repetition of Nadab's name in both 1 Chronicles 8 and 9 reinforces the significance of these genealogical records in the chronicler's account of Israel's history.
