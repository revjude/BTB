Lappidoth was the husband of Deborah, a prophetess and judge who led Israel during a time of oppression by the Canaanites \([[Judg.4.4|Jdg.4.4]]\). No further information is provided about Lappidoth in the Bible, and he is not mentioned in the account of Deborah's leadership and the victory over the Canaanite army led by Sisera \(Jdg.4-5\). It is possible that Lappidoth supported Deborah in her role as a judge and prophetess, but the biblical text does not provide any specific details about his life or their relationship.
