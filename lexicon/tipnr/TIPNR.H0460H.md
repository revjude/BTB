The Gershonites were one of the three main divisions of the Levites, along with the Kohathites and Merarites. They were responsible for the care and transportation of the tabernacle's curtains, coverings, and related items \(Numbers 3:25-26\). As the leader of the Gershonites, Eliasaph would have overseen their duties and ensured that they fulfilled their responsibilities in the service of the tabernacle.
