- A woman living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[2Tim.1.5|2Ti.1.5]]; 
- only referred to as Eunice **<big>[[G2131|Εὐνίκη]]</big>**; 
- her mother was Lois **<big>[[G3090|Λωΐς]]</big>**;

Eunice was the mother of Timothy, a young Christian leader and companion of Paul \([[2Tim.1.5|2 Timothy 1:5]]\). She was a Jewish believer married to a Greek man \(Acts 16:1\). Eunice, along with her mother Lois, had a sincere faith that greatly influenced Timothy's spiritual development \([[2Tim.1.5|2 Timothy 1:5]]\). Paul's mention of Eunice's faith suggests that she played a significant role in Timothy's early education in the Scriptures and his growth as a Christian \(2 Timothy 3:15\).
