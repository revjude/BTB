- An Egyptian Pharaoh living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at 1Ki.3.1; 
- only referred to as Pharaoh<[[H6547K]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>פ</span>ַּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>\); 
- husband of Tahpenes<[[H8472G]]>.

This Pharaoh was the Egyptian ruler during the reign of King Solomon \(1 Kings 3:1; 9:16\). Solomon made an alliance with Pharaoh and married his daughter, who brought the city of Gezer as a dowry. Solomon built a separate palace for Pharaoh's daughter \([[1Kgs.7.8|1 Kings 7:8]]; 9:24; [[2Chr.8.11|2 Chronicles 8:11]]\) and included her among his many foreign wives \([[1Kgs.11.1|1 Kings 11:1]]\). 

The Bible also mentions that Hadad, an Edomite prince, fled to Egypt during David's reign and found favor with Pharaoh, who gave him land and provisions and arranged for him to marry the sister of Queen Tahpenes \([[1Kgs.11.1|1 Kings 11:1]]8-20\). Hadad's son Genubath was raised in Pharaoh's court \(1 Kings 11:20\). 

The specific identity of this Pharaoh is not provided in the Bible. However, based on the historical and archaeological evidence, some scholars suggest that he may have been Siamun or Psusennes II, rulers of the 21st Dynasty of Egypt, which was contemporary with Solomon's reign.
