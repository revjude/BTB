Shelemiah was sent with Jerahmeel in the events surrounding Jeremiah's scroll \([[Jer.36.26|Jeremiah 36:26]]\). After King Jehoiakim burned Jeremiah's scroll, which contained prophecies of judgment, he sent Jerahmeel, along with two others, to arrest Jeremiah and his scribe Baruch. However, the Lord hid them, and they were not found. Shelemiah is mentioned only as Jerahmeel's father and is not recorded as having any other role in the narrative.
