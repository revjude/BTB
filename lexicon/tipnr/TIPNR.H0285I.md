Ahitub is mentioned in the genealogy of Ezra, the priest and scribe who played a significant role in the religious reforms and the restoration of Jewish worship after the Babylonian exile. Ahitub is listed as the son of Amariah and the father of Zadok in this priestly lineage. \([[1Chr.6.11|1Ch.6.11]],12; [[Ezra.7.2|Ezr.7.2]]\) 

The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 6 traces the descendants of Levi, focusing on the priestly line of Aaron. It establishes the legitimacy and continuity of the priesthood, highlighting significant figures such as Zadok, who served during the reigns of David and Solomon. 

In the book of Ezra, the same genealogy is repeated, demonstrating Ezra's priestly heritage and his authority to teach and enforce the Law of Moses among the returning exiles. \(Ezr.7.1-6\) 

While no specific details are provided about Ahitub's life or his role as a priest, his inclusion in the genealogies underscores the importance of the priestly lineage and its connection to the spiritual leadership of Israel, particularly in the post-exilic period.
