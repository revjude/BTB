<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Joel</span> is listed in the genealogy of Judah as a descendant of Simeon \([[1Chr.4.35|1Ch.4.35]]\).
- A man from the tribe of Simeon\(?\) living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.4.35|1Ch.4.35]]; 
- only referred to as Joel<[[H3100H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יו</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>ֵ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>\).

Joel is briefly mentioned in [[1Chr.4.35|1 Chronicles 4:35]] as part of the genealogy of the tribe of Judah. He is listed among the descendants of Simeon, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The inclusion of Simeonite names within the genealogy of Judah suggests that some members of the tribe of Simeon may have been absorbed into Judah or lived within their territory.
