Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Joiarib</span>, a descendant of Judah through Perez, settled in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile \([[Neh.11.5|Neh.11.5]]\).
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.11.5|Neh.11.5]]; 
- only referred to as Joiarib **<big>[[H3114|יוֹיָרִיב]]</big>**; 
- a son of Zechariah **<big>[[H2148|זְכַרְיָה]]</big>**; 
-  father of Adaiah **<big>[[H5718|עֲדָיָה]]</big>**.

Joiarib is mentioned in [[Neh.11.5|Nehemiah 11:5]] as one of the descendants of Judah who settled in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. He is specifically identified as a descendant of Perez, one of the twin sons of Judah and Tamar \(Gen.38.29\). 

In the context of Nehemiah 11, the author is providing a list of the people who resettled in Jerusalem after the completion of the city wall. This resettlement was part of the effort to repopulate and strengthen the holy city following the return from exile. 

Joiarib's inclusion in this list indicates that he was among the Jews who chose to live in Jerusalem, despite the challenges and hardships involved in rebuilding the city. As a descendant of Judah, he represented the continuation of the royal tribe in Jerusalem, even though the Davidic monarchy had not been restored. 

No additional information is provided about Joiarib's life, occupation, or specific role within the community. However, his presence in Jerusalem as part of the resettlement effort underscores the importance of the city in the religious and national identity of the Jews in the post-exilic period.
