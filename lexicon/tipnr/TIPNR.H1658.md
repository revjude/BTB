Gishpa is mentioned briefly in [[Neh.11.21|Nehemiah 11:21]] as one of the overseers of the Nethinim, or temple servants, who lived on the hill of Ophel in Jerusalem. The Nethinim were a group of people assigned to assist the Levites in the maintenance and service of the temple. They were originally Gibeonites who had been spared by Joshua \(Joshua 9\) and were later designated by David and the princes to serve in the temple \(Ezra 8:20\). Gishpa's role was to oversee and manage the work of the Nethinim.
