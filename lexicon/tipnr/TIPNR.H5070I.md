<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Nadab</span> was a son of Shammai, mentioned in the genealogy of the tribe of Judah.
- A man from the tribe of Judah living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Chr.2.28|1Ch.2.28]]; 
- only referred to as Nadab<[[H5070I]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>\); 
-  son of Shammai<[[H8060G]]>; 
- a brother of Abishur<[[H0051]]>; 
-  father of Seled<[[H5540]]> and Appaim<[[H0649]]>.

Nadab is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.2.28|1 Chronicles 2:28]] and 2:30 as one of the sons of Shammai, a descendant of Judah through his son Jerahmeel. This reference appears in a genealogical record that traces the lineage of the tribe of Judah, providing insight into the family lines within the tribe. 

In the genealogy, Shammai is listed as the son of Onam, who was the son of Jerahmeel \(1 Chronicles 2:26-28\). Nadab is named alongside his brother Abishur as the sons of Shammai \([[1Chr.2.28|1 Chronicles 2:28]]\). 

Apart from being listed as a son of Shammai, no additional information is provided about Nadab's life, character, or role within the tribe of Judah. His mention in the genealogy serves primarily to establish his place within the family line and to contribute to the overall record of the tribe's history and lineage. 

The inclusion of Nadab in this genealogical record demonstrates the importance of family heritage and tribal identity in ancient Israelite society. These records helped establish the legitimacy of land claims, leadership roles, and the preservation of the tribe's history and connection to their ancestors.
