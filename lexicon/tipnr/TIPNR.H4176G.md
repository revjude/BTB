Moreh is the name of two distinct locations mentioned in the Bible. The first is a place near Shechem, where Abraham built an altar to the Lord after arriving in Canaan \([[Gen.12.6|Gen.12.6]]\). This location is described as being near the great tree \(or terebinth\) of Moreh, which served as a landmark. It was here that God appeared to Abraham and promised to give the land to his descendants. The second location is a hill near Gilgal, mentioned in Deuteronomy 11:30 in connection with the blessing and cursing ceremony that the Israelites were to perform upon entering the Promised Land. The hill of Moreh was likely situated opposite Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, where the ceremony was to take place. The name "Moreh" may be derived from the Hebrew word meaning "teacher" or "diviner," possibly indicating the presence of a religious site or oracle in ancient times.
