- A king of Northern Israel, living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Kgs.15.14|2Ki.15.14]];

Menahem was the son of Gadi and became king of Israel after assassinating Shallum, who had reigned for only one month \([[2Kgs.15.14|2Ki.15.14]]\). Menahem reigned for ten years in Samaria \([[2Kgs.15.17|2Ki.15.17]]\). During his reign, he was known for his cruelty, particularly for his brutal treatment of the city of Tiphsah, where he ripped open pregnant women \([[2Kgs.15.16|2Ki.15.16]]\). When Pul, the king of Assyria, invaded Israel, Menahem paid him a thousand talents of silver to withdraw and to strengthen his own hold on the kingdom \([[2Kgs.15.19|2Ki.15.19]]-20\). To raise this tribute, Menahem exacted fifty shekels of silver from each wealthy man in Israel \([[2Kgs.15.20|2Ki.15.20]]\). Menahem died and was succeeded by his son Pekahiah \([[2Kgs.15.22|2Ki.15.22]]\).
