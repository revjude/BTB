Saraph is briefly mentioned in [[1Chr.4.22|1 Chronicles 4:22]] as one of the sons of Shelah, who was a son of Judah. The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 4 lists some of the prominent families and individuals within the tribe of Judah. Saraph is described as one of the men who "had dominion in Moab and Jashubi-lehem" \([[1Chr.4.22|1 Chronicles 4:22]]\). This suggests that Saraph and his family may have had some influence or authority in the region of Moab, a neighboring nation to Israel. However, no further details are provided about Saraph's life or his specific role. The mention of Jashubi-lehem is also unclear, as it could refer to a place or a person. Saraph's inclusion in the genealogy serves to highlight the various descendants of Judah and their activities in the surrounding regions.
