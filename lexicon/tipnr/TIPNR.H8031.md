Shalishah is mentioned briefly in the account of Saul's search for his father's lost donkeys \(1 Sam. 9:4\). Saul and his servant passed through the hill country of Ephraim and the land of Shalishah but did not find the donkeys. They then continued through the land of Shaalim and the land of Benjamin, still without success. The exact location of Shalishah is unknown, but it was likely situated in the central hill country of Israel, north of Jerusalem. The name "Shalishah" may be derived from the Hebrew word "shalosh," meaning "three," possibly indicating a region known for its three hills or valleys. The mention of Shalishah in this narrative serves to highlight the extent of Saul's search and the various regions he traversed before encountering the prophet Samuel, who would anoint him as the first king of Israel.
