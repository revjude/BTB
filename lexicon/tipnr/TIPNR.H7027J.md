- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Esth.2.5|Est.2.5]]; 
- only referred to as Kish **<big>[[H7027|קִישׁ]]</big>**; 
-  father of Shimei **<big>[[H8096|שִׁמְעִי]]</big>**.

Kish is mentioned in [[Esth.2.5|Esther 2:5]] as an ancestor of Mordecai, a prominent Jewish figure in the Persian court during the reign of King Ahasuerus \(Xerxes I\). Mordecai is introduced as "the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite." 

This genealogical reference to Kish establishes Mordecai's lineage within the tribe of Benjamin. It is important to note that this Kish is not the same person as Saul's father, who was also named Kish and was from the tribe of Benjamin. 

The mention of Kish in Mordecai's ancestry provides a connection to the tribe of Benjamin and emphasizes the Jewish identity of Mordecai and his family, who were living in exile in the Persian Empire. 

Apart from this brief mention in the genealogy of Mordecai, no further information is provided about this particular Kish or his life. His inclusion in the lineage serves to establish Mordecai's background and heritage as a Benjamite Jew living in the diaspora.
