Pedaiah was a Benjamite who settled in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile, according to [[Neh.11.7|Nehemiah 11:7]]. He is mentioned in a list of people from various tribes who lived in Jerusalem after the return from exile. The resettlement of Jerusalem was an important step in the restoration of Jewish life and worship in the post-exilic period. Pedaiah's inclusion in this list suggests he was part of the initial group that returned to establish a presence in the city.
