Zabad, the son of Nebo, is mentioned in the list of men who had married foreign wives during the Babylonian exile. This problem was discovered when Ezra, the priest and scribe, returned to Jerusalem and found that many Israelites had intermarried with the pagan peoples of the land, violating God's command. Zabad was among those who had taken a foreign wife. In response to Ezra's call for repentance, Zabad and the others agreed to put away their foreign wives and children to maintain the purity of the Jewish people. He is also referred to as "Zabadeas" in 1 Esdras 9:35.
