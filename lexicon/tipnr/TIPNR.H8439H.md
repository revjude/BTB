Tola was a judge of Israel who succeeded Abimelech and ruled for 23 years \([[Judg.10.1|Judges 10:1]]-2\). He was the son of Puah and the grandson of Dodo from the tribe of Issachar. Tola lived and was buried in Shamir, located in the hill country of Ephraim. His name means "crimson worm" or "scarlet stuff." Despite being one of the judges, the biblical account provides no details about Tola's deeds or accomplishments during his leadership. The brief mention of his reign serves as a transition between the tumultuous rule of Abimelech and the subsequent judge, Jair.
