Telem is mentioned in [[Josh.15.24|Joshua 15:24]] as one of the towns in the Negev region of Judah, allotted to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land. It is listed among other towns such as Ziph, Bealoth, and Hazor-hadattah. The Negev was the southern desert region of Judah, known for its arid climate and sparse vegetation. The exact location of Telem is unknown, and no further information about this town is provided in the Bible. Its mention in the list of Judah's towns suggests that it was a small settlement in the southern part of the tribe's territory.
