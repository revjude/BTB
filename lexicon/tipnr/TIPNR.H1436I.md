Gedaliah, mentioned in [[1Chr.25.3|1 Chronicles 25:3]] and 9, was one of the sons of Jeduthun, a Levite appointed by King David as a temple musician. Jeduthun, along with Asaph and Heman, was a chief musician responsible for leading worship in the tabernacle \(1 Chronicles 25:1, 6\). Gedaliah and his brothers were skilled in music and prophecy, using lyres, harps, and cymbals to prophesy and give thanks and praise to the Lord \([[1Chr.25.3|1 Chronicles 25:3]]\). The musicians were divided into twenty-four groups, each responsible for serving in the temple for a specific period. Gedaliah was the head of the second group \([[1Chr.25.9|1 Chronicles 25:9]]\). The appointment of Gedaliah and his fellow musicians highlights the importance of music and worship in the Israelite religion and the structured organization of temple services during David's reign.
