Ezekiel was a priest and prophet who lived during the time of the Babylonian exile. He was the son of Buzi and was among the captives taken to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar in 597 BC \([[Ezek.1.3|Ezekiel 1:3]]\). Ezekiel received visions and messages from God while in exile, which he recorded in the Book of Ezekiel. His prophecies included warnings of judgment against Israel and the surrounding nations, as well as messages of hope and restoration for God's people. Ezekiel's life and actions often served as symbolic signs to the people of Israel, such as his unusual behavior during his wife's death, which was meant to illustrate the coming destruction of Jerusalem \([[Ezek.24.24|Ezekiel 24:24]]\). His ministry spanned approximately 22 years, from the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's captivity until at least the 27th year \(Ezekiel 1:2; 29:17\).
