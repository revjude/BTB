Imri is mentioned in [[1Chr.9.4|1 Chronicles 9:4]] as one of the descendants of Judah who lived in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. He is specifically identified as a descendant of Perez, one of the twin sons of Judah. 

The genealogical record in 1 Chronicles 9 lists the families and individuals from various tribes of Israel who resettled in Jerusalem and the surrounding areas after returning from the Babylonian captivity. This resettlement took place under the leadership of Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah. 

Imri's mention in this context suggests that he was part of the group that returned to Jerusalem and contributed to the rebuilding and restoration of the city and its community. The fact that he is identified as a descendant of Perez indicates that his lineage was traced back to one of the prominent clans within the tribe of Judah. 

Apart from this brief mention, no other details are provided about Imri's life, occupation, or specific role in the post-exilic community. However, his inclusion in the genealogical record highlights the importance of family lineage and tribal identity in the reconstitution of Jewish society after the exile. 

The name Imri is derived from the Hebrew root meaning "to speak" or "to command." It is possible that this name reflects the individual's role or character, but the text does not provide any further information to confirm this. 

Imri's presence in the list of those who resettled in Jerusalem underscores the significance of the return from exile and the efforts made by the Jewish people to reestablish their presence in the land and to rebuild their religious and social institutions.
