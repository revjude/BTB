Uzza is mentioned as an ancestor of some of the temple servants \(Nethinim\) who returned to Jerusalem from the Babylonian captivity. These servants were likely descendants of people who had been assigned by David and the leaders to assist the Levites in the temple service. The list in Ezra and Nehemiah records those who came back to help rebuild Jerusalem and restore the temple worship after the exile.
