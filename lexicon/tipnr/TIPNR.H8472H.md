The father of Tahpenes is mentioned in [[1Kgs.11.19|1 Kings 11:19]] as the Egyptian Pharaoh who showed favor to Hadad, an Edomite prince who fled to Egypt after King David's conquest of Edom. The Pharaoh welcomed Hadad and provided for him, even giving him his sister-in-law, the sister of Queen Tahpenes, as a wife. This marriage alliance demonstrates the Pharaoh's support for Hadad and his willingness to grant him refuge in Egypt. The name of this Pharaoh is not specified in the biblical text.
