Word sometimes translated as a name

The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Dinaite</span>s were one of the groups who wrote to King Artaxerxes, opposing the rebuilding of Jerusalem during Ezra's time. \([[Ezra.4.9|Ezr.4.9]]\)
- A group or a word meaning "judges", only mentioned at [[Ezra.4.9|Ezr.4.9]]; 
- only referred to as Dinaite<[[H1784]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ִּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ינ</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ֵ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>\).

The Dinaites are mentioned in [[Ezra.4.9|Ezra 4:9]] as one of several groups who wrote a letter to King Artaxerxes of Persia, opposing the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the temple. This letter was part of a larger effort by the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin to halt the reconstruction work that had begun under the leadership of Zerubbabel and Jeshua. 

The Dinaites are listed alongside other groups such as the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, and the people of Susa, Erech, and Babylon. These groups are collectively referred to as "the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over and settled in the cities of Samaria" \(Ezra 4:10\). Osnappar is likely another name for the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal, who was known for his policy of resettling conquered peoples. 

The letter these groups sent to Artaxerxes contained accusations against the Jews, claiming that if the city were rebuilt and its walls completed, the Jews would rebel and cause damage to the royal revenue. As a result of this letter, the rebuilding work was temporarily halted until the second year of the reign of King Darius of Persia \(Ezra 4:24\). 

Apart from this single mention in Ezra, no further information is provided about the Dinaites or their specific origins. Their inclusion in the list of opposing groups highlights the challenges and opposition faced by the Jews as they sought to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple following their return from Babylonian exile.
