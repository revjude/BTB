Almodad is mentioned in the genealogies of the nations, which are recorded in the book of Genesis and later in the book of 1 Chronicles. He is listed as one of the sons of Joktan, who was a descendant of Shem, the son of Noah. \([[Gen.10.26|Gen.10.26]]; [[1Chr.1.20|1Ch.1.20]]\) 

The genealogy in Genesis 10, often referred to as the "Table of Nations," traces the descendants of Noah's three sons—Shem, Ham, and Japheth—and their dispersal across the earth after the flood. It provides a framework for understanding the origins and relationships of various nations and people groups. 

Joktan, Almodad's father, is described as the ancestor of several Arabian tribes. His descendants, including Almodad, are believed to have settled in the southern regions of the Arabian Peninsula. \([[Gen.10.26|Gen.10.26]]-30\) 

Apart from being listed in the genealogies, no further details are provided about Almodad's life, his role within the family, or any specific events associated with him. 

The inclusion of Almodad in the genealogies serves to document the branching out of the human family after the flood and to trace the origins of various nations and tribes. It also highlights the importance of genealogical records in the ancient Near Eastern context and their significance in the biblical narrative.
