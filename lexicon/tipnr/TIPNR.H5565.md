Obed-Edom and his descendants were entrusted with the responsibility of serving as gatekeepers in the temple during the reign of King David. Semachiah, along with his brothers, who were described as capable men with strength for the service, were assigned the task of guarding the temple entrances. The gatekeepers played a crucial role in maintaining the sanctity and security of the temple. They ensured that only authorized individuals entered the sacred premises and that the temple remained protected from any potential threats.
