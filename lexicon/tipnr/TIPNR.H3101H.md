During a joint military campaign with King Jehoshaphat of Judah, Ahab sought advice from his prophets regarding the battle against the Arameans at Ramoth-gilead. When the prophet Micaiah prophesied Ahab's defeat and death, the king ordered Joash to imprison Micaiah until his safe return from the battle. However, Ahab was killed in the battle, fulfilling Micaiah's prophecy.
