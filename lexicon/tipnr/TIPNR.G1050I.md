- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Rom.16.23|Rom.16.23]]; 
- only referred to as Gaius **<big>[[G1050|Γάϊος]]</big>**.

Gaius, mentioned in [[Rom.16.23|Romans 16:23]] and [[1Cor.1.14|1 Corinthians 1:14]], was a believer from Corinth who played a significant role in the early church. In his letter to the Romans, Paul sends greetings from Gaius, describing him as his host and the host of the whole church. This suggests that Gaius was a wealthy and generous man who opened his home for Christian gatherings and provided hospitality to Paul and other believers. In 1 Corinthians, Paul mentions that he personally baptized Gaius, along with Crispus and the household of Stephanas. This indicates that Gaius was one of the early converts in Corinth and had a close relationship with Paul. Gaius' example of hospitality and support for the church was crucial for the growth and unity of the early Christian community.
