Naaman is mentioned in [[Num.26.40|Numbers 26:40]] and [[1Chr.8.4|1 Chronicles 8:4]] as a grandson of Benjamin and the head of the Naamite clan within the tribe of Benjamin. He was the son of Bela, Benjamin's firstborn son. 

In Numbers 26, a census of the Israelites is taken in the plains of Moab, near the end of their wilderness wanderings. This census lists the clans within each tribe, including the Naamites, who are identified as descendants of Naaman. 

The mention of Naaman and the Naamite clan in this context highlights the growth and organization of the tribe of Benjamin since their early days in Egypt. It demonstrates that the descendants of Benjamin, including Naaman, had become a significant and recognized group within the Israelite community. 

As the head of the Naamite clan, Naaman would have held a position of leadership and responsibility within the tribe. The clan structure was an important aspect of Israelite society, providing a sense of identity, belonging, and mutual support for its members. 

While no additional details are given about Naaman's life or specific actions, his inclusion in these passages emphasizes the importance of family lineage and clan identity in the social and organizational structure of ancient Israel.
