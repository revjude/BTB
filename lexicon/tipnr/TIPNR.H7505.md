Raphu is mentioned in the book of Numbers as the father of Palti, who was from the tribe of Benjamin \([[Num.13.9|Numbers 13:9]]\). Palti was one of the twelve spies chosen by Moses to explore the land of Canaan before the Israelites were to enter it. Each spy was a leader from his respective tribe. The spies were sent to assess the land, its people, and its resources. After forty days, they returned with their report, but only Joshua and Caleb gave a positive assessment. The other ten spies, including Palti, discouraged the people by emphasizing the challenges they would face. As a result, the Israelites rebelled against God and were punished with forty years of wandering in the wilderness.
