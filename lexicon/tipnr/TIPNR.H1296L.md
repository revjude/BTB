Berechiah was the father of the prophet Zechariah, who prophesied during the reign of Darius, king of Persia \(Zec. 1:1,7\). Zechariah, along with Haggai, encouraged the Jews to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem after their return from Babylonian exile \(Ezr. 5:1; 6:14\). Berechiah is mentioned in the opening verses of the book of Zechariah, establishing the prophet's lineage and the time of his ministry. As the father of a prominent prophet, Berechiah likely played a significant role in his son's spiritual upbringing and education.
