The Emim are mentioned in the Bible as an ancient people group who inhabited the region of Moab before the Moabites \(Deu.2.10\). They are described as a tall and numerous people, comparable to the Anakim, another group known for their great height \(Deu.2.11\). The Emim were one of the groups defeated by Chedorlaomer, the king of Elam, and his allies during a military campaign in the region \([[Gen.14.5|Gen.14.5]]\). This event took place during the time of Abraham, indicating the antiquity of the Emim as a people group. The Bible does not provide much additional information about the Emim's culture, language, or specific territory. Their mention in the context of the Moabites and the Anakim suggests that they were a formidable and well-established people in the region before being displaced or assimilated by later groups. The Emim serve as an example of the various ancient peoples who inhabited the land of Canaan prior to the Israelite conquest.
