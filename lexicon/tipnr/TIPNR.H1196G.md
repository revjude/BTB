Baanah was one of the two captains who assassinated Ish-bosheth, the son of King Saul. After Saul's death, Ish-bosheth had been proclaimed king over Israel, while David ruled over Judah. According to 2 Samuel 4, Baanah and his brother Rechab, who were Benjamites from Beeroth, entered Ish-bosheth's house while he was resting and killed him. They brought his head to David, hoping to be rewarded. However, David condemned their treacherous act and ordered their execution. The text describes Baanah and Rechab as wicked men who murdered an innocent person. Their actions were motivated by self-interest rather than loyalty. David's response demonstrated his integrity and respect for Saul's family, as he refused to condone violence against his rivals.
