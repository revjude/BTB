Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest, appears in the biblical narrative during the reign of King David. He served as a messenger and informant alongside Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, during the time of Absalom's rebellion against David \([[2Sam.15.27|2Sa.15.27]],36\). 

When David was forced to flee Jerusalem due to Absalom's coup, he instructed Jonathan and Ahimaaz to remain in the city and send word to him about any developments \([[2Sam.15.27|2Sa.15.27]]-29\). The two young men stayed near En-rogel, outside the city, to avoid detection \([[2Sam.17.17|2Sa.17.17]]\). A servant girl would relay messages to them, which they would then deliver to David \([[2Sam.17.17|2Sa.17.17]]\). 

When Absalom's men came searching for Jonathan and Ahimaaz, a woman hid them in a well and covered it, misleading the pursuers \(2Sa.17.18-20\). The two then escaped and informed David of Ahithophel's advice to Absalom \(2Sa.17.21\). 

Later, during the tensions surrounding Solomon's succession to the throne, Jonathan brought news to Adonijah and his supporters that Solomon had been anointed king \([[1Kgs.1.42|1Ki.1.42]]-48\). This report led to the disbanding of Adonijah's faction. 

Jonathan's role as a messenger and informant highlights the importance of loyalty and communication during times of political upheaval. His service to David, along with that of Ahimaaz, was crucial in helping the king navigate the challenges posed by Absalom's rebellion and the uncertainties of the royal succession.
