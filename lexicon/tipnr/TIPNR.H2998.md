Ibnijah is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.9.8|1 Chronicles 9:8]] as one of the Benjamites who lived in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. He is listed among the descendants of Benjamin who resettled in the city. 

The genealogical record in 1 Chronicles 9 provides a list of the Israelites, particularly from the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Levi, who returned to Jerusalem and the surrounding areas following the Babylonian captivity. This resettlement took place after the Persian king Cyrus issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to their homeland and rebuild the temple in Jerusalem. 

Ibnijah's inclusion in this list suggests that he was part of the group that returned to Jerusalem and contributed to the rebuilding and restoration of the city and its community. The mention of his name also indicates that he was a person of some significance within the Benjamite clan. 

Apart from this brief mention, no other details are provided about Ibnijah's life or role in the post-exilic community. However, his presence in the genealogical record attests to the importance of family lineage and tribal identity in the reconstitution of Jewish society after the exile.
