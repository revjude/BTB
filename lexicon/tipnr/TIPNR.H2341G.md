<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Havilah</span> was a land mentioned in the description of Eden, known for its pure gold, aromatic resin \(bdellium\), and onyx stone \([[Gen.2.11|Gen.2.11]]-12\).
- A location in Arabia only mentioned at [[Gen.2.11|Gen.2.11]]; 
- only referred to as Havilah **<big>[[H2341|חֲוִילָה]]</big>**.

Havilah was a land mentioned in the biblical description of the Garden of Eden. It was situated near the Pishon, one of the four rivers that flowed from Eden \([[Gen.2.11|Gen.2.11]]\). Havilah was noted for its valuable resources, including pure gold, bdellium \(an aromatic gum resin\), and onyx stone \(Gen 2:12\). The exact location of Havilah is unknown, as the geographical references in the Eden account are challenging to identify with certainty. Some scholars propose that it may have been located in the Arabian Peninsula or near the Persian Gulf, but this remains speculative.
