Malta is an island in the Mediterranean Sea mentioned in the New Testament in connection with the apostle Paul's journey to Rome. After Paul's ship was caught in a violent storm, it ran aground on a sandbar near Malta \(Acts 27:39-44\). Paul and the other survivors made it safely to shore, where they were welcomed by the islanders \(Acts 28:1-2\). During his three-month stay on Malta, Paul healed the father of Publius, the chief official of the island, as well as many others who were sick \(Acts 28:7-9\). The kindness shown by the people of Malta to Paul and his companions exemplifies the hospitality that Christians should extend to others \(Acts 28:10\).
