Calah was one of the ancient cities built by Nimrod, the great-grandson of Noah, in the land of Assyria \([[Gen.10.11|Genesis 10:11]]-12\). It was located along the Tigris River, south of Nineveh, in what is now northern Iraq. Calah, together with Nineveh and Resen, formed a complex of major Assyrian cities known for their power and influence in the ancient Near East. 

The city of Calah served as the capital of the Assyrian Empire during the reigns of several powerful kings, including Ashurnasirpal II and Tiglath-pileser III. It was known for its impressive palaces, temples, and artistic achievements. Archaeological excavations at the site, known today as Nimrud, have uncovered significant remains of the ancient city, including royal inscriptions, reliefs, and statues. 

In the Bible, Calah is mentioned only in the context of Nimrod's kingdom and the early development of Assyria. Its inclusion in the list of Nimrod's cities highlights the importance and antiquity of the Assyrian civilization, which would later play a significant role in the history of Israel and Judah.
