Aroer was a city located on the northern edge of the Arnon Valley, in what is now modern-day Jordan. It is mentioned several times in the Old Testament, often in the context of defining territorial boundaries and military campaigns. 

In Deuteronomy 2:36, Aroer is described as being on the edge of the Arnon Valley, marking the southern limit of the territory conquered by the Israelites from King Sihon of the Amorites. This area was later allotted to the tribe of Reuben \(Deuteronomy 3:12; [[Josh.13.9|Joshua 13:9]], 16\). 

Aroer is also mentioned in the description of the extent of King Sihon's territory, which stretched from the Arnon to the Jabbok \([[Josh.12.2|Joshua 12:2]]\). During the time of the judges, Jephthah reminded the Ammonites that Israel had possessed the land from Aroer to the Jabbok for three hundred years \([[Judg.11.26|Judges 11:26]]\). 

In the reign of Jehu, king of Israel, the territory from Aroer was lost to Hazael, king of Aram \([[2Kgs.10.33|2 Kings 10:33]]\). The prophet Jeremiah also mentions Aroer in his prophecy concerning Moab, calling upon the inhabitants of Aroer to ask about the destruction that has come upon them \([[Jer.48.19|Jeremiah 48:19]]\). 

Aroer's significance in the Bible lies in its strategic location along the Arnon Valley, serving as a boundary marker and a point of reference in territorial descriptions. Its frequent mention in the context of military campaigns and territorial allotments underscores its importance as a key city in the region.
