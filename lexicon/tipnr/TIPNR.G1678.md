Elmadam is mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus Christ recorded in the Gospel of Luke \([[Luke.3.28|Luk.3.28]]\). He is listed as the son of Er and the father of Cosam in the lineage traced from Jesus back to Adam. The genealogy in Luke's Gospel is believed to represent the ancestry of Jesus through his mother, Mary. Elmadam's inclusion in this genealogy highlights the importance of family lineage in Jewish tradition and the significance of Jesus being a descendant of notable figures in Israel's history. However, no additional information about Elmadam's life, his role, or the historical context in which he lived is provided in the Bible. His mention serves primarily to establish the continuity of the ancestral line leading to Jesus Christ.
