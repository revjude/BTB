Lo-ammi was the symbolic name given to the son of the prophet Hosea and his wife Gomer \([[Hos.1.9|Hos.1.9]]\). The name Lo-ammi means "not my people" in Hebrew. This name, along with the names of Hosea's other children, Jezreel and Lo-ruhamah, was used by God to convey a message to the people of Israel. The name Lo-ammi symbolized God's rejection of Israel due to their unfaithfulness and idolatry. God declared that He would no longer consider Israel as His people and would withdraw His mercy from them \([[Hos.1.9|Hos.1.9]]\). This message was part of Hosea's prophecy, which called the Israelites to repentance and warned of the consequences of their disobedience. The symbolic names of Hosea's children served as a powerful visual reminder of God's judgment and the broken relationship between God and His people.
