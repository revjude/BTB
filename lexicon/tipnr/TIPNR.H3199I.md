Levite living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Jachin</span> was a priest who resided in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile \([[1Chr.9.10|1Ch.9.10]]; [[Neh.11.10|Neh.11.10]]\).
- A priest from the tribe of Levi  living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[1Chr.9.10|1Ch.9.10]]; 
- only referred to as Jachin **<big>[[H3199|יָכִין]]</big>**.

Jachin is mentioned in two post-exilic lists of priests who lived in Jerusalem. In [[1Chr.9.10|1 Chronicles 9:10]] and [[Neh.11.10|Nehemiah 11:10]], he is identified as one of the priests who settled in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. 

These lists record the names of the priests, Levites, and other Israelites who returned to Jerusalem to reestablish worship and community life following the decree of Cyrus, king of Persia, which allowed the Jews to return to their homeland \(Ezr.1.1-4\). 

As a priest, Jachin would have been involved in the religious life of the community, serving in the rebuilt temple and offering sacrifices on behalf of the people. The presence of priests in Jerusalem was essential for the restoration of proper worship and the observance of the Mosaic law. 

No other specific details are provided about Jachin's life or role within the priestly community. His inclusion in these lists, however, highlights the importance of the priestly lineage and the restoration of religious life in Jerusalem after the exile.
