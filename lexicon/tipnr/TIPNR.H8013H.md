Shelomoth and his brothers were in charge of the treasuries for the dedicated gifts brought to the temple. These included the spoils of war dedicated by King David, the chiefs of the fathers' houses, and the commanders of the army \([[1Chr.26.26|1 Chronicles 26:26]]-28\). Shelomoth's role was to oversee and manage these treasuries.
