Maai was a Levite musician who took part in the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah \([[Neh.12.36|Neh.12.36]]\). After the completion of the wall's reconstruction, Nehemiah organized a grand dedication ceremony that involved two large choirs processing around the city on top of the wall \(Neh.12.27-43\). Maai is listed among the Levite musicians who played instruments and sang during this celebratory event. The participation of Levite musicians in the dedication ceremony highlights the importance of music and worship in the religious life of the Jewish community. No further information is provided about Maai's specific role or personal life in the biblical text. His inclusion in the list of musicians demonstrates the significance of the Levites' musical duties in the context of religious celebrations and the restoration of Jerusalem during the post-exilic period.
