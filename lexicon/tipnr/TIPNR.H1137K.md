Man living at the time of Exile and Return

The sons of <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Bani</span> were among those who had married foreign women during Ezra's time.
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.38|Ezr.10.38]]; 
- only referred to as Bani **<big>[[H1137|בָּנִי]]</big>**.

In [[Ezra.10.38|Ezra 10:38]], the sons of Bani are mentioned among the groups that had married foreign women. The context is Ezra's call for the people to repent and separate from their foreign wives, which was seen as a violation of God's law \(Ezra 10:10-11\). The term "sons" here likely refers to a family group or clan rather than a specific individual named Bani. This family group is listed along with others who had intermarried with the neighboring peoples. By agreeing to put away their foreign wives, the sons of Bani demonstrated a willingness to obey God's commands and maintain the purity of the Jewish community.
