Zimran was one of the sons of Abraham and his second wife, Keturah, as recorded in Genesis 25 and 1 Chronicles 1. He was born after the death of Abraham's first wife, Sarah, and was one of six sons that Abraham had with Keturah. The Bible does not provide any further details about Zimran's life or his descendants. However, his mention in the genealogical records of both Genesis and 1 Chronicles suggests that he was a significant figure in the lineage of Abraham. Some scholars believe that the names of Keturah's sons, including Zimran, may represent Arabian tribes or regions, indicating the geographical spread of Abraham's descendants. The story of Abraham's marriage to Keturah and the birth of their sons demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promise to make Abraham the father of many nations, even in his old age.
