Hizkiah is mentioned in [[1Chr.3.23|1 Chronicles 3:23]] as one of the sons of Neariah, who was a descendant of King David through the line of Jeconiah \(also known as Jehoiachin\). Jeconiah was one of the last kings of Judah before the Babylonian exile, and his descendants are listed in the genealogy found in 1 Chronicles 3. 

The name Hizkiah is a variant of Hezekiah, which means "Yahweh strengthens." This name was common among the Israelites and was also borne by one of the kings of Judah. 

Apart from being mentioned in this genealogy, no other information is provided about Hizkiah in the Bible. However, his inclusion in the lineage of David suggests that he was part of an important family line that continued after the Babylonian exile, and may have played a role in the restoration of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the temple.
