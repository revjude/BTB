Shelemiah was the father of Irijah, a guard at the Benjamin Gate in Jerusalem during the reign of King Zedekiah. When Jeremiah attempted to leave Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin, Irijah arrested him, accusing him of deserting to the Chaldeans \([[Jer.37.13|Jeremiah 37:13]]\). Irijah brought Jeremiah to the officials, who beat him and imprisoned him. Shelemiah is mentioned only as Irijah's father and is not recorded as having any other role in the events.
