<small>*A place from which Solomon obtained gold*</small>

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Parvaim</span> was a place or region from which Solomon obtained gold for decorating the temple in Jerusalem.
- A location only mentioned at [[2Chr.3.6|2Ch.3.6]]; 
- only referred to as Parvaim **<big>[[H6516|פַּרְוַיִם]]</big>**.

Parvaim is a place mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[2Chr.3.6|2 Chronicles 3:6]], as the source of gold used by King Solomon to decorate the temple in Jerusalem. The exact location of Parvaim is unknown, and there are no other biblical references to this place. Some scholars suggest that the name may be derived from the Sanskrit word "purva," meaning "eastern," and thus could be a general term for regions east of Israel. Others propose that Parvaim might be a variant of Sepharvaim, a place mentioned in the Syriac and Targum Jonathan versions of Genesis 10:30. However, due to the lack of additional information in the biblical text and other historical sources, the identification of Parvaim remains uncertain.
