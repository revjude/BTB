Bahurim, also spelled Baharum, was a village located near Jerusalem, likely within the territory of Benjamin. It is mentioned several times in the Bible, primarily in connection with events during the reign of King David. 

In [[2Sam.3.16|2 Samuel 3:16]], Bahurim is mentioned as the place where Michal, David's wife, was returned to him by her husband Paltiel, as ordered by David. Later, when David was fleeing from his son Absalom, Shimei, a member of Saul's clan from Bahurim, cursed and threw stones at David and his men \([[2Sam.16.5|2 Samuel 16:5]]\). However, when David returned to Jerusalem after Absalom's defeat, Shimei met him at the Jordan River and apologized for his actions \([[2Sam.19.16|2 Samuel 19:16]]; [[1Kgs.2.8|1 Kings 2:8]]\). 

Bahurim is also mentioned as the hometown of Azmaveth, one of David's mighty men \([[2Sam.23.31|2 Samuel 23:31]]; [[1Chr.11.33|1 Chronicles 11:33]]\). Additionally, Jonathan and Ahimaaz, the sons of the priests Abiathar and Zadok, hid in a well at Bahurim to avoid being captured by Absalom's men while relaying information to David \([[2Sam.17.18|2 Samuel 17:18]]\).
