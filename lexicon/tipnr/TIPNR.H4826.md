Marsena was one of the seven princes of Persia and Media who had access to King Ahasuerus' presence and held the highest positions in the kingdom. These princes were consulted by the king when he sought advice regarding the appropriate response to Queen Vashti's refusal to appear before him and his guests \([[Esth.1.14|Esther 1:14]]\). The counsel of these princes led to the king's decision to remove Vashti as queen and seek a new queen to replace her.
