Ziphion, also known as Zephon, was a son of Gad, one of the twelve sons of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\). He is mentioned in the genealogy of Jacob's descendants who went down to Egypt during the time of Joseph \([[Gen.46.16|Genesis 46:16]]\). Ziphion is also listed in the census of the Israelites taken in the wilderness of Sinai \([[Num.26.15|Numbers 26:15]]\), where he is identified as the ancestor of the Zephonite clan. The Zephonites were one of the families within the tribe of Gad, named after their progenitor Ziphion. The fact that the clan bore his name suggests that he was a significant figure in the lineage of Gad. However, no further details are provided about Ziphion's life or his role within the family. The mention of Ziphion in these genealogical records emphasizes the importance of family heritage and tribal identity among the Israelites.
