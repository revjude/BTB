Geshan is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.2.47|1 Chronicles 2:47]] as one of the sons of Jahdai, who was a wife of Caleb. Caleb was a prominent figure from the tribe of Judah, known for his faithfulness and loyalty to God during the Israelites' wilderness wanderings \(Numbers 13:30; 14:24\). The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 2 traces the descendants of Judah, with a focus on the line of Hezron, which includes Caleb. Geshan is listed among the sons of Jahdai, along with Jotham, Jether, Pelet, Ephah, and Shaaph. No further information is provided about Geshan's life or his role within the tribe of Judah. The mention of Geshan in the genealogy serves to highlight the importance of family lineage and the preservation of ancestral records in ancient Israelite society.
