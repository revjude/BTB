He was among the three mighty warriors who were with David when they defied the Philistines gathered at Pas Dammim. The Philistines had assembled there for battle, and the men of Israel withdrew. But Eleazar stood his ground and struck down the Philistines until his hand grew tired and froze to the sword. The Lord brought about a great victory that day, and the troops returned to Eleazar, but only to strip the dead. This account highlights Eleazar's bravery, loyalty to David, and his significant role in securing a victory against the Philistines.
