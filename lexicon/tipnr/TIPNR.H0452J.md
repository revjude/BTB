Elijah is listed in the Book of Ezra as one of the descendants of Elam who had married foreign women during the Babylonian exile \([[Ezra.10.26|Ezr.10.26]]\). After the return to Jerusalem, Ezra discovered that many Israelites had intermarried with the neighboring peoples, which was a violation of God's command. Elijah was among those who had taken foreign wives, but he agreed to put away his wife as part of the covenant renewal led by Ezra.
