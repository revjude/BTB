Shaalbim, also known as Shaalabbin, was a town allotted to the tribe of Dan in the territorial distribution of Canaan \(Josh. 19:42\). However, the Amorites persisted in dwelling in Shaalbim and its neighboring towns, Beth-shemesh and Aijalon, forcing the Danites into the hill country \(Judg. 1:35\). The town was later included in the administrative district overseen by Ben-Deker during Solomon's reign \(1 Ki. 4:9\). Shaalbim is also notable as the hometown of Eliahba the Shaalbonite, one of David's mighty men \(2 Sam. 23:32; 1 Chr. 11:33\). The term "Shaalbonite" indicates a person from Shaalbim, highlighting the town's significance in providing valiant warriors for David's army. The exact location of Shaalbim is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the Shephelah region, the lowlands between the central hill country and the coastal plain of Israel.
