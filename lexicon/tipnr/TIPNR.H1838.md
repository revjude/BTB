Dinhabah was the capital city of Edom during the reign of King Bela, son of Beor \([[Gen.36.32|Genesis 36:32]]; [[1Chr.1.43|1 Chronicles 1:43]]\). It is mentioned in the genealogical records of the kings of Edom, which are listed in both Genesis and 1 Chronicles. Dinhabah served as the seat of power for Bela, who was the first king of Edom mentioned in the Bible. The exact location of Dinhabah is unknown, but it was likely situated in the mountainous region of Edom, southeast of the Dead Sea. As the capital city, Dinhabah would have been a center of political, economic, and cultural importance for the Edomites during Bela's reign.
