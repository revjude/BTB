Rab-saris is mentioned as one of the Babylonian officials sent by King Sennacherib of Assyria to Jerusalem during his campaign against Judah \([[2Kgs.18.17|2 Kings 18:17]]\). The name "Rab-saris" is likely a title meaning "chief eunuch" or "chief officer." He was accompanied by Tartan and Rabshakeh, two other high-ranking Assyrian officials. Their mission was to intimidate King Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem into surrendering. The presence of Rab-saris, along with the other officials, underscores the gravity of the situation and the might of the Assyrian army threatening Judah.
