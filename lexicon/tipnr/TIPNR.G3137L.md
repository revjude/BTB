Mary was a woman living in Jerusalem and the mother of John Mark, who later became a companion of Paul and Barnabas. When Peter was miraculously released from prison, he went to Mary's house, where many believers had gathered to pray for him. This indicates that Mary's home served as a meeting place for the early church in Jerusalem \(Acts 12:12\). Her son, John Mark, would later accompany Paul and Barnabas on their missionary journeys and was a source of disagreement between the two leaders \(Acts 12:25; 15:37-39\). Tradition holds that John Mark wrote the Gospel that bears his name based on Peter's teachings.
