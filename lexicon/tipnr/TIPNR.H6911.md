Kibzaim, also referred to as Jokmeam, was a city allotted to the Levites within the tribal territory of Ephraim \([[Josh.21.22|Joshua 21:22]]; [[1Chr.6.68|1 Chronicles 6:68]]\). The Levites, who were responsible for the religious duties in Israel, were not given a specific territory like the other tribes but were distributed among the various tribes in cities designated for their use. These cities served as places of residence for the Levites and their families. The name Kibzaim is used in the book of Joshua, while Jokmeam is used in the parallel passage in 1 Chronicles. Its location is unknown.
