- A Syrian man with leprosy living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Kgs.5.1|2Ki.5.1]]; 
- referred to as Naaman<[[H5283I]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ֲ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>מ</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ן</span>\), or Naaman<[[G3497]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Νεεμάν</span>, <span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ναιμάν</span>\).

Naaman was a commander of the army of the king of Aram \(Syria\) who lived during the time of the prophet Elisha. He is described as a great man, highly regarded by his master, and a valiant soldier. However, Naaman was afflicted with leprosy \([[2Kgs.5.1|2 Kings 5:1]]\). 

Through an Israelite servant girl, Naaman learned of the prophet Elisha in Samaria who could heal him of his leprosy. With his king's permission, Naaman traveled to Israel, carrying a letter from the king of Aram to the king of Israel. The king of Israel, mistakenly believing that the king of Aram was trying to provoke a quarrel, tore his clothes in distress \([[2Kgs.5.2|2 Kings 5:2]]-7\). 

When Elisha heard of this, he sent a message to the king, telling him to send Naaman to him. Naaman arrived at Elisha's house with his horses and chariots, expecting a grand healing ceremony. Instead, Elisha sent a messenger, instructing Naaman to wash seven times in the Jordan River \(2 Kings 5:8-10\). 

Initially, Naaman was angry and refused, believing that the rivers of Damascus were better than the waters of Israel. However, his servants persuaded him to follow Elisha's instructions. Naaman dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, and his flesh was restored, becoming clean like that of a young boy \([[2Kgs.5.1|2 Kings 5:1]]1-14\). 

Grateful for his healing, Naaman returned to Elisha, declaring his belief in the God of Israel and offering a gift, which Elisha refused. Naaman then requested two mule-loads of earth to take back with him, so that he could worship the Lord on Israelite soil \([[2Kgs.5.1|2 Kings 5:1]]5-19\). 

Jesus later referred to Naaman's story in [[Luke.4.27|Luke 4:27]], using it as an example of God's grace extending beyond Israel to the Gentiles. Naaman's healing demonstrates God's power, compassion, and willingness to heal and save those who turn to Him in faith, regardless of their nationality or background.
