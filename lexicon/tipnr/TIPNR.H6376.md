Pishon is one of the four rivers mentioned in the biblical account of the Garden of Eden \(Gen. 2:11\). The Bible describes a single river flowing out of Eden to water the garden, which then divided into four rivers, with Pishon being the first. Pishon is said to wind through the entire land of Havilah, a region known for its abundance of gold, bdellium \(a fragrant resin\), and onyx stone \(Gen. 2:11-12\). The name "Pishon" is thought to derive from the Hebrew root "puwsh," meaning "to scatter, spread, or spring forward," possibly indicating that the river originated from a spring and formed a delta. Despite attempts to identify Pishon with various modern-day rivers, such as the Nile, Indus, or Ganges, its exact location remains unknown, as the geography described in the Eden account is difficult to reconcile with the current landscape. Some scholars suggest that the Pishon and the other rivers of Eden may have symbolic or allegorical significance, representing the life-giving power and abundance that flowed from God's presence in the garden.
