Ebed is mentioned in [[Ezra.8.6|Ezra 8:6]] as one of the descendants of Adin who returned to Jerusalem with Ezra during the second wave of the return from Babylonian exile. This return took place during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia, who granted Ezra permission to lead a group of exiles back to Jerusalem \(Ezra 7:11-26\). 

Ezra, a priest and scribe skilled in the Law of Moses, gathered a group of Israelites, including priests, Levites, and laypeople, to return to Jerusalem. The purpose of this return was to reestablish proper worship and religious practices in the city and to strengthen the Jewish community there. 

In preparation for the journey, Ezra proclaimed a fast by the river Ahava, seeking God's protection and guidance \(Ezra 8:21-23\). He also took measures to ensure the safety of the temple treasures they were carrying and to appoint leaders among the priests and Levites \(Ezra 8:24-30\). 

Ebed, as a descendant of Adin, was part of this group of returnees. The mention of his name and lineage highlights the diverse composition of the returning exiles and the importance of maintaining genealogical records. 

Apart from this brief mention, no further information is provided about Ebed's specific role or contributions during the return to Jerusalem or the subsequent events recorded in the book of Ezra.
