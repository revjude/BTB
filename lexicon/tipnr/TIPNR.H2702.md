Hazar-susim was a town allotted to the tribe of Simeon, as recorded in [[1Chr.4.31|1 Chronicles 4:31]]. The name "Hazar-susim" means "village of horses" in Hebrew, suggesting that the town may have been known for its horse-breeding or horse-related activities. 

The town is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the context of a list of cities and villages belonging to the tribe of Simeon. This list is part of a genealogical record of the descendants of Simeon, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. 

According to the text, the Simeonites had their inheritance within the territory of Judah, as the land allocated to Judah was too large for them \(Joshua 19:9\). The list in 1 Chronicles 4 enumerates the towns and villages that were part of Simeon's inheritance. 

Hazar-susim is listed along with other towns such as Bethul, Hormah, Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-shual. These settlements were located in the Negev region, the southern part of Canaan, known for its arid and semi-arid climate. 

The exact location of Hazar-susim is uncertain, as the town is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in other historical sources. However, its inclusion in the list of Simeonite towns suggests that it was a recognized settlement within their territory during the time of the chronicler. 

The mention of Hazar-susim in the biblical text serves to provide a detailed account of the cities and villages allocated to the tribe of Simeon and to underscore the importance of maintaining accurate genealogical records. It also highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to give each tribe a portion of the Promised Land as an inheritance.
