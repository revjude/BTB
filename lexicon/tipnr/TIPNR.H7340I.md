Rehob is mentioned as the father of Hadadezer, the king of Zobah \([[2Sam.8.3|2 Samuel 8:3]], 12\). Zobah was an Aramean kingdom located northeast of Israel, in the region of modern-day Syria. During the reign of King David, Hadadezer and his allies were defeated by David's army when they attempted to extend their influence to the Euphrates River \([[2Sam.8.3|2 Samuel 8:3]]-4\). David captured a large amount of gold, silver, and bronze from Hadadezer's cities, which he dedicated to the Lord \(2 Samuel 8:11-12\). The defeat of Hadadezer and the Arameans of Zobah was a significant victory for David, establishing his dominance in the region and expanding the boundaries of his kingdom. The mention of Rehob as Hadadezer's father provides additional context to the political situation of the time.
