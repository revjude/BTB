Elioenai is mentioned as one of the priests who participated in the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah \([[Neh.12.41|Neh.12.41]]\). After the completion of the wall's reconstruction, Nehemiah organized a grand dedication ceremony that involved two large choirs processing on top of the wall. Elioenai was part of the group of priests who blew trumpets during this celebration. The Bible does not provide any further details about Elioenai's life or priestly responsibilities.
