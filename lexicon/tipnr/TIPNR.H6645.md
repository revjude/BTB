Zibiah was the mother of King Joash \(or 'Jehoash'\) of Judah. She was from Beersheba, a town in the southern part of Judah. Zibiah is mentioned only in connection with her son's accession to the throne, and no other details about her life are provided in the Bible. The fact that she was from Beersheba suggests that the king of Judah may have been seeking to consolidate control over the southern region through this marriage alliance. Zibiah's name means "gazelle" in Hebrew, which may have been a reference to her beauty or grace. Her son, Jehoash, became king at the age of seven and reigned for forty years in Jerusalem.
