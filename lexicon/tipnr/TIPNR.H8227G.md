Shaphan, mentioned in [[Ezek.8.11|Ezekiel 8:11]], was the father of Jaazaniah, one of the seventy elders of Israel who were involved in idolatrous worship practices within the temple. In a vision given to the prophet Ezekiel, he sees these elders burning incense and engaging in abominable practices in a secret chamber of the temple. Jaazaniah, the son of Shaphan, is specifically named among these elders. This event highlights the spiritual decay and the prevalence of idolatry among the leaders of Israel, even within the sacred precincts of the temple. The mention of Shaphan as the father of Jaazaniah suggests that he may have been a well-known figure, possibly due to his own position or the significance of his family. However, the text does not provide any further details about Shaphan himself or his role in the events described in the vision.
