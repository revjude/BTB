Judah is identified as the son of Senuah in a list of leaders living in Jerusalem after some of the Jewish exiles returned from Babylon \([[Neh.11.9|Nehemiah 11:9]]\). He is described as being "second over the city," likely indicating a position of authority under the primary city official. The people under his leadership were from the tribe of Judah. No other details are provided about Judah's life or achievements. He is not to be confused with the patriarch Judah, son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\), or the tribe and kingdom that bore his name.
