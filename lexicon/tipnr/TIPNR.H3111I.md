The son of Joiada is mentioned in [[Neh.13.28|Nehemiah 13:28]] as a grandson of the high priest Eliashib who married the daughter of Sanballat the Horonite. Sanballat was a prominent adversary of Nehemiah and the governor of Samaria. This marriage alliance between a member of the high priestly family and the daughter of an enemy of Jerusalem was considered a serious violation of the covenant. Nehemiah responded by driving the offending priest away from Jerusalem, demonstrating his commitment to maintaining the purity and integrity of the Jewish community.
