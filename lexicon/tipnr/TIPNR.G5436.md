<small>*Male • Believer who deserted Paul in Asia*</small>

Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Phygelus</span>, along with Hermogenes, was mentioned by Paul as having deserted him during his ministry in Asia.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[2Tim.1.15|2Ti.1.15]]; 
- only referred to as Phygelus **<big>[[G5436|Φύγελλος]]</big>**.

Phygelus is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[2Tim.1.15|2 Timothy 1:15]], where Paul writes that all those in Asia had turned away from him, including Phygelus and Hermogenes. This suggests that Phygelus was a believer who had been part of Paul's ministry in Asia Minor \(modern-day Turkey\) but had deserted him at some point. Paul does not provide any further details about Phygelus' background, the specific reason for his desertion, or his subsequent actions. The mention of Phygelus serves as a reminder that even those who have been close companions in ministry can fall away from the faith or abandon their fellow believers in times of difficulty.
