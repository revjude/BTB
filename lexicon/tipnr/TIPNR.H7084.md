Keilah was a town located in the Shephelah, or lowland region, of Judah \([[Josh.15.44|Joshua 15:44]]\). During the time of King Saul, the Philistines attacked Keilah and robbed the threshing floors. David, who was fleeing from Saul at the time, inquired of the Lord and was directed to go and save Keilah \([[1Sam.23.1|1 Samuel 23:1]]-5\). David and his men successfully defended the town against the Philistines. However, when Saul heard that David was in Keilah, he planned to besiege the city and capture him. David again sought the Lord's guidance and learned that the people of Keilah would surrender him to Saul. As a result, David and his men left Keilah and continued to evade Saul \([[1Sam.23.7|1 Samuel 23:7]]-13\). Keilah is also mentioned in the genealogies of Judah \([[1Chr.4.19|1 Chronicles 4:19]]\) and in the context of the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls during the time of Nehemiah \([[Neh.3.17|Nehemiah 3:17]]-18\). The exact location of Keilah is uncertain, but it is believed to be in the western foothills of Judah, possibly at the site of Khirbet Qila, about 8 miles northwest of Hebron.
