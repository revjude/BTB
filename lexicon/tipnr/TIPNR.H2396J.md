Hezekiah is mentioned in the lists of the exiles who returned to Jerusalem from Babylon. He is identified as the leader of a clan that numbered 98 people \(Ezr.2.16; Neh.7.21\). These lists were compiled to record the individuals and families who returned to Judah after the Babylonian captivity. Hezekiah's presence in these lists suggests that he played a leadership role among the returning exiles and was responsible for his clan during the journey and resettlement in Jerusalem. No other details about this Hezekiah are provided in the Bible. \(Ezr.2.16; Neh.7.21\).
