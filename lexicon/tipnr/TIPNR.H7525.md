Rizia is briefly mentioned in [[1Chr.7.39|1 Chronicles 7:39]] as one of the sons of Ulla, who was a descendant of Asher. The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 7 lists some of the prominent families and individuals within the tribe of Asher, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. Rizia is listed alongside his brothers Arah and Haniel as sons of Ulla. No further information is provided about Rizia or his role within the tribe. His inclusion in the genealogy serves to document the family lines and descendants of Asher, the eighth son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and Zilpah, whose tribe was allotted territory in the northern part of Canaan along the Mediterranean coast.
