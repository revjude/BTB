People living in Parthia

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Parthians</span>, one of the people groups present in Jerusalem at Pentecost.
- People living in Parthia, only mentioned at [[Esth.9.7|Act.2.9]]; 
- only referred to as Parthians<[[G3934]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Πάρθος</span>\).

The Parthians were one of the people groups present in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit came upon the disciples, as recorded in Acts 2:9. They heard the disciples miraculously speaking in their own language, testifying to God's mighty works. The Parthians were likely Jews or proselytes originally from the Parthian empire east of the Roman empire, in what is now northeastern Iran and Turkmenistan. Their presence in Jerusalem for the feast of Pentecost reflects the widespread dispersion of the Jewish people in the ancient world.
