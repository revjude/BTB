Baalah is listed in [[Josh.15.29|Joshua 15:29]] as one of the towns in the southernmost part of the territory allocated to the tribe of Judah. However, in Joshua 19:3, it is mentioned as one of the towns given to the tribe of Simeon within their inheritance in the midst of Judah's territory. This suggests that Baalah was initially part of Judah's allotment but was later given to Simeon. The exact location of Baalah is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the Negev region, south of Judah.
