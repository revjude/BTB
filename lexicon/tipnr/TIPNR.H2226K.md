- only referred to as Zerah<[[H2226K]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ז</span>ֶ֫<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ח</span>\).

Zerah the Ethiopian \(or Cushite\) was a military commander who led a massive invasion force against Judah during the reign of King Asa. According to 2 Chronicles 14, Zerah's army numbered over a million men and included 300 chariots. They advanced as far as Mareshah before encountering Asa's forces in the Valley of Zephathah. Asa called upon the Lord for help, and the Ethiopians were defeated and pursued as far as Gerar. The exact identity of Zerah is uncertain. Some scholars suggest he may have been Usarken II, an Egyptian pharaoh, while others propose he was an Arabian leader. Whoever he was, his defeat was a significant victory for Judah and a demonstration of God's power on behalf of His people.
