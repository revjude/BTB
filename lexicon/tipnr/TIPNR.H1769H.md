Dibon is mentioned in [[Neh.11.25|Nehemiah 11:25]] as one of the cities in Judah inhabited by the people of Judah after their return from Babylonian exile. This Dibon is distinct from the Dibon located in Moab. The exact location of this Judean Dibon is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the Negev region, south of Jerusalem. As part of the resettlement efforts after the exile, Dibon was one of the cities reoccupied by the returning Judahites as they sought to re-establish their presence in the land.
