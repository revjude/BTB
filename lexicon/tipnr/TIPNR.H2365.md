Hushai, also known as Hushai the Arkite, was a close friend and advisor to King David. He played a significant role during the rebellion of David's son Absalom, as recorded in 2 Samuel 15-17. 

When David fled from Jerusalem due to Absalom's rebellion, Hushai met him on the Mount of Olives, mourning and showing his loyalty to the king \([[2Sam.15.32|2 Samuel 15:32]]\). David instructed Hushai to return to Jerusalem and feign allegiance to Absalom, in order to counter the advice of Ahithophel, Absalom's counselor \(2 Samuel 15:34\). 

Hushai followed David's plan and gained Absalom's trust \(2 Samuel 16:16-19\). When Ahithophel advised Absalom to pursue David immediately, Absalom sought Hushai's opinion \([[2Sam.17.5|2 Samuel 17:5]]-7\). Hushai cleverly countered Ahithophel's advice, suggesting that Absalom gather a larger army before pursuing David \([[2Sam.17.8|2 Samuel 17:8]]-13\). Absalom followed Hushai's advice, which bought David time to regroup and ultimately led to Absalom's defeat \([[2Sam.17.14|2 Samuel 17:14]]-15\). 

Hushai's loyalty and wise counsel were instrumental in helping David overcome the crisis of Absalom's rebellion. His actions demonstrate the importance of faithful friends and advisors, especially in times of difficulty. 

In addition to his role during Absalom's rebellion, Hushai is mentioned in [[1Kgs.4.16|1 Kings 4:16]] as one of Solomon's twelve district governors, responsible for providing provisions for the king and his household. He is also listed in [[1Chr.27.33|1 Chronicles 27:33]] as one of David's counselors, along with Jonathan, David's uncle. 

Hushai's service to both David and Solomon highlights his enduring loyalty to the Davidic dynasty and his valued role as a trusted advisor to the kings of Israel.
