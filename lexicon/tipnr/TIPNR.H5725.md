Adullam was a Canaanite city that was conquered by Joshua during the Israelite conquest of Canaan \([[Josh.12.15|Joshua 12:15]]\). It was later allotted to the tribe of Judah and listed among the cities in the Shephelah \(lowlands\) region \([[Josh.15.35|Joshua 15:35]]\). During the time of King Saul, David fled from Saul and sought refuge in the cave of Adullam, where he was joined by about 400 men who were in distress, debt, or discontent \([[1Sam.22.1|1 Samuel 22:1]]-2\). 

Later, during the reign of King David, three of his mighty men broke through the Philistine lines to bring him water from the well in Bethlehem, passing by the cave of Adullam \([[2Sam.23.13|2 Samuel 23:13]]-17; [[1Chr.11.15|1 Chronicles 11:15]]-19\). King Rehoboam, son of Solomon, fortified Adullam as part of his defensive strategy \([[2Chr.11.7|2 Chronicles 11:7]]\). After the Babylonian exile, Adullam was among the towns resettled by the people of Judah \([[Neh.11.30|Nehemiah 11:30]]\). 

The prophet Micah used Adullam as a symbol of the degradation and shame that would come upon the nobles of Israel because of their sins \([[Mic.1.15|Micah 1:15]]\). In the story of Judah and Tamar, Judah was associated with the town of Adullam, where his friend Hirah lived \([[Gen.38.1|Genesis 38:1]],12,20\). Adullam's location is believed to be at Tel esh-Sheikh Madhkur, about 16 miles \(26 km\) southwest of Jerusalem.
