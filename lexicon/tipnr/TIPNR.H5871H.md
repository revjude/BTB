Ain or En-rimmon was a city located in the Negev region of Judah, south of Jerusalem. It is mentioned in the list of cities allotted to the tribe of Judah \([[Josh.15.32|Joshua 15:32]]\) and later as part of the inheritance of the tribe of Simeon \([[Josh.19.7|Joshua 19:7]]; [[1Chr.4.32|1 Chronicles 4:32]]\). The city was also designated as a Levitical city for the descendants of Aaron \([[Josh.21.16|Joshua 21:16]]\). 

The name Ain means "spring" or "fountain," while Rimmon means "pomegranate." It is possible that the city was named for a nearby spring and the presence of pomegranate trees. After the Babylonian exile, some people from En-rimmon resettled in Judah \([[Neh.11.29|Nehemiah 11:29]]\). 

The exact location of Ain or En-rimmon is uncertain, but it is generally associated with the modern village of Umm er-Rumamim, about 9 miles \(14.5 km\) northeast of Beersheba. The city's mention in various tribal allotments and its designation as a Levitical city highlight its importance in the southern part of Judah's territory.
