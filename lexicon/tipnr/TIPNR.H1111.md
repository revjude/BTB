<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Balak</span>, son of Zippor, was the king of Moab who tried to curse Israel through Balaam.
- A king in Moab living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Num.22.2|Num.22.2]]; 
- referred to as Balak **<big>[[H1111|בָּלָק]]</big>**, or Balak **<big>[[G0904|Βαλάκ]]</big>**; 
- a son of Zippor **<big>[[H6834|צִפּוֹר]]</big>**.

Balak was the king of Moab during the time when the Israelites were approaching the Promised Land \([[Num.22.4|Numbers 22:4]]\). Fearing the large number of Israelites, Balak hired the pagan prophet Balaam to curse them \(Numbers 22:5-6\). Despite Balak's repeated attempts and offerings, Balaam could only bless Israel as God commanded \(Numbers 23-24\). Balak became angry with Balaam for not cursing Israel and sent him away \(Numbers 24:10-11\). Balak is mentioned in the farewell speeches of Joshua \([[Josh.24.9|Joshua 24:9]]\) and Jephthah \([[Judg.11.25|Judges 11:25]]\) as an example of how God protected Israel from their enemies. The prophet Micah also refers to Balak's story as a reminder of God's righteousness \([[Mic.6.5|Micah 6:5]]\). In [[Rev.2.14|Revelation 2:14]], Balak is associated with Balaam's scheme to entice Israel into idolatry and immorality. Balak's actions demonstrate the futility of opposing God's plan and people.
