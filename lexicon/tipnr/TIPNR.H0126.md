Admah was one of the five "cities of the plain" mentioned in the Bible, along with Sodom, Gomorrah, Zeboiim, and Bela \(Zoar\). It was located in the Jordan Valley near the Dead Sea \([[Gen.10.19|Genesis 10:19]]\). Admah, along with Zeboiim, allied with the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah in a rebellion against Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and his allies \([[Gen.14.2|Genesis 14:2]],8\). As a result, Admah and the other cities were defeated and plundered by Chedorlaomer's coalition. 

Later, Admah was destroyed by God along with Sodom and Gomorrah because of their wickedness \(Deuteronomy 29:23\). The destruction of these cities is held up as an example of God's judgment against sin. The prophet Hosea also refers to Admah and Zeboiim as a warning to Israel, emphasizing the severity of God's potential judgment \([[Hos.11.8|Hosea 11:8]]\). The exact location of Admah is unknown, as the cities of the plain were completely destroyed, but it was likely situated in the southern part of the Dead Sea basin.
