Sophereth \(or Hassophereth\) is mentioned in [[Ezra.2.55|Ezra 2:55]] and [[Neh.7.57|Nehemiah 7:57]] as the ancestor of a family of Solomon's servants who were among the exiles that returned to Jerusalem from Babylon. Solomon's servants were a group of people who were assigned to work for King Solomon and his descendants, possibly as craftsmen, laborers, or officials. 

The name Sophereth appears in the list of returning exiles in the book of Ezra, while in the parallel passage in Nehemiah, the name is recorded as Hassophereth. This variation may be due to differences in spelling or transcription over time. 

The descendants of Sophereth are listed among the exiles who returned to Jerusalem under the leadership of Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, and Jeshua.
