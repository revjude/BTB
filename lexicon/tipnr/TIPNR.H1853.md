Diklah is mentioned in the genealogies of Genesis 10 and 1 Chronicles 1 as a descendant of Shem through Joktan. Joktan was the brother of Peleg and a great-grandson of Shem, one of Noah's sons \(Genesis 10:25-26; 1 Chronicles 1:19-20\). 

The genealogies in these chapters provide an overview of the nations and peoples that descended from Noah's sons after the flood. Diklah is listed among the sons of Joktan, along with other names such as Almodad, Sheleph, and Obal \([[Gen.10.27|Genesis 10:27]]; [[1Chr.1.21|1 Chronicles 1:21]]\). 

The exact location and identity of the people or lands associated with Diklah are not specified in the Bible. However, based on the context of the genealogies and the names of his brothers, it is likely that Diklah's descendants settled in the Arabian Peninsula or the surrounding regions. 

Apart from these genealogical references, no further information is provided about Diklah or his specific role in the biblical narrative. His mention serves to trace the origins and spread of the nations in the ancient Near East following the flood.
