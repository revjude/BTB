Sur is mentioned in [[2Kgs.11.6|2 Kings 11:6]] as a gate of the temple in Jerusalem. It is listed along with the gates of the guards and the gate behind the guards. The exact location and identity of the Sur Gate are uncertain, but some scholars suggest that it may refer to the Foundation Gate \(2 Chr. 23:5\). The context of the passage describes the measures taken by Jehoiada the priest to protect the young king Joash during his coronation and the overthrow of Athaliah.
