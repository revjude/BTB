Hepher was a son of Gilead, who was a descendant of Manasseh, the son of Joseph. He is mentioned in the genealogies of the tribe of Manasseh in Numbers and Joshua \([[Num.26.32|Num.26.32]]; [[Josh.17.2|Jos.17.2]]\). Hepher's descendants were known as the Hepherites, one of the clans within the tribe of Manasseh \([[Num.26.32|Num.26.32]]\). The daughters of Zelophehad, who were descendants of Hepher, played a significant role in establishing inheritance rights for women in the absence of male heirs \([[Num.27.1|Num.27.1]]; [[Josh.17.3|Jos.17.3]]\). They brought their case before Moses and the leaders, and God instructed that they should receive an inheritance among their father's relatives. This event set a precedent for inheritance laws in Israel. \([[Num.26.32|Num.26.32]],33; 27.1; [[Josh.17.2|Jos.17.2]],3\).
