The Broad Wall was a section of Jerusalem's city wall mentioned in the book of Nehemiah. During Nehemiah's rebuilding of the city walls, repairs were made to the Broad Wall by Hananiah son of Shelemiah and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph \([[Neh.3.8|Nehemiah 3:8]]\). The wall's exact location is not specified, but it was likely a significant defensive structure, possibly wider or more substantial than other parts of the wall. 

Later, during the dedication of the completed wall, two choirs proceeded in opposite directions along the top of the wall. One choir went past the Broad Wall to the Ephraim Gate \([[Neh.12.38|Nehemiah 12:38]]\), indicating that the Broad Wall was located in the northern part of the city, possibly near the Temple area. 

The Broad Wall's construction and repair were part of Nehemiah's efforts to restore Jerusalem's defenses and rebuild the city after the Babylonian exile. Its mention in the Bible highlights the importance of fortifications in ancient cities and the significance of Nehemiah's work in revitalizing Jerusalem.
