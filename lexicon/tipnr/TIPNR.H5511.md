King living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Sihon</span> was the Amorite king of Heshbon who refused to let the Israelites pass through his land and was subsequently defeated by them.
- A king of Amorites living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Num.21.21|Num.21.21]]; 
- referred to as Sihon or "he" \(KJV= Sihon\) <[[H5511]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ס</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יחו</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ן</span>\).

Sihon, the Amorite king of Heshbon, is mentioned in several passages in the Old Testament, particularly in the books of Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, 1 Kings, Nehemiah, Psalms, and Jeremiah. He ruled over the territory east of the Jordan River, which the Israelites sought to pass through on their way to the Promised Land. 

When Moses sent messengers to Sihon requesting permission to pass through his land peacefully, Sihon refused and instead gathered his army to attack the Israelites \([[Num.21.21|Numbers 21:21]]-23; Deuteronomy 2:26-30\). In response, the Israelites fought against Sihon and his army, defeating them and conquering his territory \(Numbers 21:24-25; Deuteronomy 2:31-37\). The victory over Sihon was seen as a significant milestone in the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land and a demonstration of God's power and faithfulness to His people. 

The conquest of Sihon's kingdom, along with that of Og, king of Bashan, allowed the Israelites to settle in the Transjordan region, with the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half of Manasseh receiving their inheritance there \([[Num.32.33|Numbers 32:33]]; [[Josh.13.10|Joshua 13:10]], 21, 27\). The defeat of Sihon and Og is remembered as a testament to God's deliverance and is celebrated in the Psalms \(Psalm 135:11; 136:19\).
