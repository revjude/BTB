Hazerim, meaning "villages," is a term used in Deuteronomy 2:23 to describe the settlements inhabited by the Avvim, a people group who lived in the region of Gaza before the Caphtorim \(Philistines\) dispossessed them. The Avvim were one of the original inhabitants of the land of Canaan before the Israelite conquest. The use of the term "villages" suggests that the Avvim lived in semi-permanent settlements, possibly consisting of rough stone walls covered with tent cloths, a type of dwelling that was common among nomadic or semi-nomadic people in the ancient Near East.
