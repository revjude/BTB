Elishama was appointed as the leader of the Ephraimites and was responsible for organizing and leading the tribe in the census, encampment, and offerings \([[Num.1.10|Num.1.10]]; 2.18; 7.48,53; 10.22\). As a tribal leader, he played a significant role in the administrative and military organization of the Israelites during their time in the wilderness.
