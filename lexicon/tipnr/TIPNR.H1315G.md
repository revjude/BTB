Basemath is mentioned in [[1Kgs.4.15|1 Kings 4:15]] as the wife of Ahimaaz, one of the twelve district governors appointed by King Solomon to oversee the provision of food for the royal household. The passage states that Ahimaaz was in charge of the district of Naphtali and that he had married Basemath, one of Solomon's daughters. This marriage alliance likely served to strengthen political ties and ensure loyalty among Solomon's governors. The mention of Basemath's marriage to Ahimaaz is the only information provided about her in the Bible, and she is not mentioned in any other context. Her inclusion in the text highlights Solomon's practice of strategic marriages to consolidate his power and the role of political alliances in his administration.
