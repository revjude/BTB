Gomorrah was one of the five cities in the plain of Jordan, along with Sodom, Admah, Zeboiim, and Zoar \([[Gen.10.19|Genesis 10:19]], 14:2\). It was located in a fertile area, well-watered like the garden of the Lord \([[Gen.13.10|Genesis 13:10]]\). 

However, the wickedness of Gomorrah and the neighboring cities was exceedingly grave \([[Gen.18.20|Genesis 18:20]]\). When God revealed His plan to destroy the cities to Abraham, the patriarch pleaded for their survival if even ten righteous people could be found \(Genesis 18:23-32\). Ultimately, only Lot and his two daughters were spared, while Gomorrah and the other cities were destroyed by sulfur and fire from heaven \([[Gen.19.24|Genesis 19:24]]-25\). 

The destruction of Gomorrah and Sodom became a symbol of God's judgment against sin and a warning to future generations \(Deuteronomy 29:23, 32:32; [[Isa.1.9|Isaiah 1:9]]-10, 13:19; [[Jer.23.14|Jeremiah 23:14]], 49:18, 50:40; Amos 4:11; [[Zeph.2.9|Zephaniah 2:9]]\). In the New Testament, Jesus used Sodom and Gomorrah as an example of the fate awaiting those who reject the gospel message \([[Matt.10.15|Matthew 10:15]]; [[Mark.6.11|Mark 6:11]]; Luke 10:12\). 

The apostle Peter cited the destruction of these cities as proof of God's judgment against the ungodly and His deliverance of the righteous \([[2Pet.2.6|2 Peter 2:6]]-9\). Jude also referred to Sodom and Gomorrah as an example of the punishment awaiting those who indulge in sexual immorality and perversion \([[Jude.1.7|Jude 1:7]]\). 

The exact location of Gomorrah remains unknown, as the cities were completely destroyed. However, it is believed to have been situated in the area south of the Dead Sea, possibly submerged beneath its waters.
