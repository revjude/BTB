Meronothite is a term used to describe two individuals in the Bible. First, Jehdeiah the Meronothite is mentioned in [[1Chr.27.30|1 Chronicles 27:30]] as the man in charge of King David's donkeys. This suggests that he may have been from a place called Meronoth, although the exact location is unknown. Second, Jadon the Meronothite is mentioned in [[Neh.3.7|Nehemiah 3:7]] as one of the people who helped repair the wall of Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah. The term Meronothite likely indicates that Jadon was from the same place as Jehdeiah, but no further information is provided about this location or its significance.
