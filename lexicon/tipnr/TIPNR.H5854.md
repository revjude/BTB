Atroth-beth-joab is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[1Chr.2.54|1 Chronicles 2:54]], as part of a genealogical record of the descendants of Judah. It was a town that seems to have been associated with or founded by Joab, who was from the tribe of Judah and served as the commander of King David's army.
