- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Kgs.18.18|2Ki.18.18]]; 
- referred to as Shebna or Shebnah \(KJV= Shebna\) <[[H7644]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ש</span>ֶׁ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>\).

Shebna, mentioned in 2 Kings 18-19 and Isaiah 22 and 36-37, was a high-ranking official in the court of King Hezekiah of Judah. He held the position of steward of the palace, which was a significant role in the royal administration. As the steward, Shebna was responsible for managing the king's household and overseeing the palace's affairs. However, the prophet Isaiah criticized Shebna for his pride and presumption, prophesying that he would be removed from his position and replaced by Eliakim \([[Isa.22.15|Isaiah 22:15]]-25\). Later, during the Assyrian invasion of Judah, Shebna, along with Eliakim and Joah, was sent by King Hezekiah to negotiate with the Assyrian officials \([[2Kgs.18.18|2 Kings 18:18]], 26, 37; 19:2; [[Isa.36.3|Isaiah 36:3]], 11, 22; 37:2\). In these passages, Shebna is mentioned alongside Eliakim, who had replaced him as the steward of the palace, indicating that Shebna had been demoted to a lower position, possibly that of a scribe. The narrative highlights the importance of humility and faithfulness in serving God and the consequences of pride and self-exaltation.
