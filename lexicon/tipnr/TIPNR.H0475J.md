Eliashib is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.24|Ezra 10:24]] as one of the priests who had married foreign women. During the time of Ezra, many Israelites, including priests and Levites, had intermarried with the pagan inhabitants of the land. Ezra called for a reform, urging those who had married foreign wives to separate from them. Eliashib was among the priests who had taken foreign wives, contrary to God's law. As part of the reform, Eliashib and the other priests pledged to put away their foreign wives and children.
