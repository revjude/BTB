Ahilud is mentioned in the Bible as the father of two important officials who served under King David and King Solomon. His first son, Jehoshaphat, held the position of recorder during David's reign. \([[2Sam.8.16|2Sa.8.16]]; [[1Chr.18.15|1Ch.18.15]]\) The recorder was responsible for maintaining official records and documents of the kingdom. 

Ahilud's second son, Baana, served as one of the twelve district governors during Solomon's reign. \([[1Kgs.4.12|1Ki.4.12]]\) These governors were appointed by Solomon to oversee the administration and provision of resources for the king's household, each being responsible for a specific region of Israel. 

The fact that both of Ahilud's sons held significant positions in the royal administration suggests that Ahilud himself may have been a prominent figure or had a close relationship with the royal family. However, no further details about Ahilud's life or role are provided in the biblical text.
