He is mentioned in 2 Chronicles as having written accounts of the reigns of King Solomon \([[2Chr.9.29|2 Chronicles 9:29]]\), King Rehoboam of Judah \([[2Chr.12.15|2 Chronicles 12:15]]\), and King Abijah of Judah \([[2Chr.13.22|2 Chronicles 13:22]]\). Iddo's writings were used as sources by the Chronicler when compiling the history of these kings. Although his works are not part of the biblical canon, they were considered reliable historical records.
