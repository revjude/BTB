Shobal is mentioned in [[Gen.36.20|Genesis 36:20]],23,29 and [[1Chr.1.38|1 Chronicles 1:38]],40 as one of the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land of Edom before the descendants of Esau. Shobal is described as a Horite chief, indicating his leadership position within the Horite clan. The Horites were the original inhabitants of the mountainous region of Seir, which later became known as Edom. Shobal's descendants, along with the other Horite clans, are listed in the genealogy of the chiefs of Edom. This genealogy demonstrates the intermingling of the Horites with the Edomites, who were descended from Esau, and the eventual dominance of the Edomites in the region.
