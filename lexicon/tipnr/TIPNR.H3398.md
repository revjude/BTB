- only referred to as Jarha<[[H3398]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ח</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>\); 
- husband of Ahlai<[[H0304G]]>;

Jarha is mentioned in [[1Chr.2.34|1 Chronicles 2:34]]-35 as an Egyptian servant who married the daughter of Sheshan, a descendant of Judah. Sheshan had no sons, only daughters, so he gave one of his daughters in marriage to his servant Jarha. This marriage between an Israelite woman and an Egyptian servant was unusual, as it deviated from the typical practice of marrying within one's tribe or nation. The text does not provide any further details about Jarha's life or his relationship with Sheshan's daughter. However, their marriage resulted in the continuation of Sheshan's lineage, as Jarha's son Attai is listed among the descendants of Judah. This inclusion of Jarha in the genealogy of Judah demonstrates that God's plan can work through unexpected means and that one's background does not limit their potential to be part of God's people.
