Bethphage, meaning "house of unripe figs" in Hebrew, was a village located on the Mount of Olives, near Bethany, just east of Jerusalem. It is mentioned in the Synoptic Gospels in connection with Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem. 

In [[Matt.21.1|Matthew 21:1]], [[Mark.11.1|Mark 11:1]], and [[Luke.19.29|Luke 19:29]], Jesus and His disciples approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives. It was from Bethphage that Jesus sent two of His disciples to retrieve a donkey and a colt, on which He would ride into Jerusalem, fulfilling the prophecy of Zechariah 9:9. 

The fact that Bethphage is mentioned alongside Bethany suggests that the two villages were in close proximity to each other. Bethany is known as the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from the dead \(John 11:1, 38-44\). 

The exact location of Bethphage is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives, near the road leading from Jericho to Jerusalem. Its name, "house of unripe figs," may refer to the presence of fig trees in the area or to a local feature associated with the cultivation or processing of figs. 

Bethphage's significance in the Gospels lies in its role as the starting point for Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, which marked the beginning of the events leading up to His crucifixion and resurrection. The village's proximity to Jerusalem and its location on the Mount of Olives, a site of great prophetic and eschatological importance, further underscores its significance in the Gospel narrative.
