Lehabim was one of the sons of Mizraim, who was a son of Ham \([[Gen.10.13|Gen.10.13]]; [[1Chr.1.11|1Ch.1.11]]\). He is mentioned in the Table of Nations, which records the descendants of Noah's sons after the flood. Lehabim is listed among the descendants of Ham, specifically as a son of Mizraim, who is associated with Egypt. The Lehabim are believed to be the ancestors of the Libyans, a people group that inhabited the region west of Egypt in North Africa. However, the exact relationship between the Lehabim and the historical Libyans is not certain.
