Caesarea was a coastal city located in Judea, approximately 30 miles \(50 kilometers\) north of Joppa. It was built by Herod the Great between 22 and 10 BC and named in honor of Augustus Caesar. Caesarea served as the capital of the Roman province of Judea and the official residence of the Roman governors. 

In the New Testament, Caesarea is mentioned several times in the book of Acts. Philip the evangelist settled in Caesarea after baptizing the Ethiopian eunuch \(Acts 8:40\). The apostle Peter visited Caesarea and preached to the Gentile centurion Cornelius, leading to his conversion \(Acts 10:1-48\). Paul passed through Caesarea on his missionary journeys \(Acts 9:30; 18:22\) and was later imprisoned there for two years before being sent to Rome for trial \(Acts 23:23-26:32\). 

Caesarea was known for its impressive harbor, which was constructed using advanced Roman engineering techniques. The city also featured a temple dedicated to Augustus, an amphitheater, a hippodrome, and a Roman aqueduct. As a center of Roman administration and a hub for trade, Caesarea played a significant role in the early spread of Christianity and the interaction between the Jewish and Gentile believers.
