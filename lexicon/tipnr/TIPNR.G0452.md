High Priest living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Annas</span>, a high priest, played a significant role in the events surrounding Jesus' arrest, trial, and crucifixion, as well as in the early persecution of the apostles.
- A High Priest living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Luke.3.2|Luk.3.2]]; 
- only referred to as Annas **<big>[[G0452|Ἄννας]]</big>**; 
-  father in law of Caiaphas **<big>[[G2533|Καϊάφας]]</big>**.

Annas was a high priest during the time of Jesus' ministry and played a significant role in the events surrounding Jesus' arrest and trial. He served as high priest from AD 6 to 15 and was succeeded by his son-in-law Caiaphas. However, even after his tenure, Annas retained significant influence and was still referred to as high priest. 

After Jesus' arrest, He was first brought before Annas for questioning. Annas then sent Jesus to Caiaphas, the current high priest, who presided over the Sanhedrin trial that condemned Jesus to death. 

Following Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection, Annas continued to oppose the early Christian church. When the apostles Peter and John were arrested for preaching in Jesus' name, they were brought before the Sanhedrin, where Annas was present as a member of the ruling council. 

Annas' involvement in the events surrounding Jesus' trial and the persecution of the early church highlights the significant influence he held, even though he was no longer the official high priest. His actions demonstrate the religious establishment's opposition to Jesus and the growing Christian movement in the early days of the church.
