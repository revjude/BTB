Straight was the name of a street in Damascus where Saul \(later known as Paul\) stayed in the house of a man named Judas after his dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus \(Acts 9:11\). It was on this street that Ananias found Saul, as instructed by the Lord in a vision, and restored his sight. The Straight Street in Damascus is still known by this name today and is believed to follow the course of the ancient Roman road, the Via Recta, which ran from east to west through the city.
