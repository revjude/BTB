Caphtor, mentioned in the Old Testament, is generally identified as the island of Crete in the Mediterranean Sea. According to Amos 9:7, the Philistines originated from Caphtor, and [[Jer.47.4|Jeremiah 47:4]] refers to "the remnant of the country of Caphtor," linking the Philistines to this island. 

In Deuteronomy 2:23, the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, are described as destroying the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, and settling in their place. This suggests that the Philistines, who are known to have settled in the coastal region of Canaan, trace their ancestry back to Caphtor. 

In the New Testament, Crete is mentioned several times in connection with the apostle Paul's travels. During his journey to Rome, Paul's ship sailed along the southern coast of Crete \(Acts 27:7-13\), and they sought to winter in the Cretan harbor of Phoenix \(Acts 27:12\). After the ship encountered a storm and was wrecked on the island of Malta, Paul continued his journey and eventually passed by Crete again \(Acts 27:21\). 

Paul also left his companion Titus on Crete to organize the church and appoint elders in every town \([[Titus.1.5|Titus 1:5]]\). In his letter to Titus, Paul quotes a Cretan prophet who described Cretans as "always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons" \([[Titus.1.12|Titus 1:12]]\), indicating the challenges Titus faced in ministering to the people of Crete. 

On the day of Pentecost, Cretans were among the people present in Jerusalem who heard the apostles speaking in their own languages \(Acts 2:11\).
