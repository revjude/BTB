Beth-car is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[1Sam.7.11|1 Samuel 7:11]], in the context of the Israelites' victory over the Philistines. After the Ark of the Covenant was returned to Israel by the Philistines, Samuel led the people in a ceremony of repentance and dedication to the Lord at Mizpah. 

When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, they decided to attack. However, as the Philistines approached, the Lord sent a loud thunder upon them, causing confusion and panic in their ranks. The Israelites then pursued the Philistines and struck them down from Mizpah to a place below Beth-car. 

The name Beth-car means "house of the lamb" or "house of pasture" in Hebrew. The exact location of Beth-car is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in the territory of Benjamin, west of Mizpah, in the direction of the Philistine cities. 

The victory at Beth-car was significant for the Israelites, as it marked the beginning of a period of peace and the end of Philistine oppression during Samuel's leadership. The pursuit of the Philistines to Beth-car demonstrates the Israelites' renewed confidence and trust in the Lord's protection and guidance.
