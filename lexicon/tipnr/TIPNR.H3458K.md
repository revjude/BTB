Ishmael is mentioned in [[2Chr.23.1|2 Chronicles 23:1]] as the son of Jehohanan. He was one of the commanders that the priest Jehoiada summoned to help him overthrow Queen Athaliah and install Joash as the rightful king of Judah. 

After the death of King Ahaziah, Athaliah had seized the throne and tried to destroy the royal family \(2Ch.22.10-12\). However, Joash was hidden by Jehoiada the priest. In the seventh year of Athaliah's reign, Jehoiada made a covenant with five commanders, including Zebadiah son of Ishmael, to support Joash as king \([[2Chr.23.1|2Ch.23.1]]\). 

Ishmael himself is not mentioned as being directly involved in the coup. However, his son Zebadiah's support was crucial in Jehoiada's plan to restore the Davidic line to the throne. The text does not provide any further details about Ishmael's life or position. His inclusion in the narrative serves to identify Zebadiah and emphasize the significance of his allegiance to Jehoiada and King Joash.
