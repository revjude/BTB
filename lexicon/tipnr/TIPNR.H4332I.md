- Daniel's compatriot living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Dan.1.6|Dan.1.6]]; 
- referred to as Mishael **<big>[[H4332|מִישָׁאֵל]]</big>**, or Mishael **<big>[[H4333|מִישָׁאֵל]]</big>**, or Meshach **<big>[[H4336|מֵישַׁךְ]]</big>**, or Meshach **<big>[[H4335|מֵישַׁךְ]]</big>**.

Mishael, better known by his Babylonian name Meshach, was one of the four young Jewish men chosen to serve in King Nebuchadnezzar's court during the Babylonian exile. He, along with Daniel \(Belteshazzar\), Hananiah \(Shadrach\), and Azariah \(Abednego\), were selected for their intelligence, knowledge, and appearance \([[Dan.1.6|Daniel 1:6]]-7\). 

Despite being given a Babylonian name and education, Mishael and his friends remained faithful to their Jewish beliefs. When faced with the king's decree to worship a golden statue, Mishael, Shadrach, and Abednego refused, even under the threat of being thrown into a fiery furnace \(Daniel 3\). Their faith and trust in God were rewarded when they miraculously survived the furnace unharmed, leading Nebuchadnezzar to acknowledge the power of their God. 

Throughout the book of Daniel, Mishael and his friends serve as examples of unwavering faith and loyalty to God in the face of adversity and pressure to conform to the surrounding culture. Their story encourages believers to remain steadfast in their faith, no matter the circumstances.
