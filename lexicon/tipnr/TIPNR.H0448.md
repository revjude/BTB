Eliathah is mentioned in [[1Chr.25.4|1 Chronicles 25:4]], 27 as one of the sons of Heman, a prominent musician during the reign of King David. Heman, along with Asaph and Jeduthun, was appointed by David to lead the music in the house of the Lord \(1 Chronicles 25:1\). Eliathah, along with his brothers, was skilled in music and was appointed to serve as a musician under the direction of his father, Heman \([[1Chr.25.4|1 Chronicles 25:4]]\). The text also mentions that Eliathah and his brothers were assigned the twentieth turn in the musical rotation \([[1Chr.25.27|1 Chronicles 25:27]]\). Eliathah's inclusion in this list highlights the importance of music in Israelite worship during David's reign.
