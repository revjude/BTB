Palti, also known as Paltiel, was the son of Laish from Gallim \([[1Sam.25.44|1 Samuel 25:44]]; [[2Sam.3.15|2 Samuel 3:15]]\). He was married to Michal, the daughter of King Saul and the first wife of David. After David fled from Saul, Saul gave Michal to Palti in marriage \([[1Sam.25.44|1 Samuel 25:44]]\). However, when David became king over all Israel, he demanded that Michal be returned to him as part of a political agreement with Abner, the commander of Saul's army \(2 Samuel 3:12-16\). Palti was forced to relinquish his wife, and he followed her weeping as far as Bahurim before being sent back by Abner \(2 Samuel 3:16\). The story of Palti and Michal highlights the complex political and personal relationships during the transition of power from Saul to David and the challenges faced by individuals caught in the midst of these events.
