Azzur is mentioned in [[Ezek.11.1|Ezekiel 11:1]] as the father of Jaazaniah, one of the twenty-five men Ezekiel saw in a vision at the entrance of the temple gate. These men are described as "princes of the people" and are portrayed as wicked leaders who were giving bad advice and plotting violence in Jerusalem. Ezekiel was brought to them in the vision to prophesy against them and announce the Lord's judgment on their evil plans. The text notes that another man named Pelatiah died as Ezekiel was prophesying, confirming the seriousness of God's message. Azzur is not directly accused of wrongdoing but is identified to specify which Jaazaniah was being condemned.
