Meshullam is mentioned in the book of Ezra as one of the Israelites who had married a foreign woman during the Babylonian exile \([[Ezra.10.29|Ezr.10.29]]\). After Ezra had led the people in confessing their sin of intermarriage and proposed a plan for the men to separate from their foreign wives, a list of those who had married foreign women was recorded. Meshullam is listed among the descendants of Bani who had taken foreign wives. In response to Ezra's call for repentance and obedience to God's law, Meshullam and the others agreed to put away their foreign wives.
