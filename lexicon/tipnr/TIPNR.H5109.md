- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.10.19|Neh.10.19]]; 
- only referred to as Nebai **<big>[[H5109|נוֹבַי]]</big>**.

Nebai is mentioned in [[Neh.10.19|Nehemiah 10:19]] as one of the leaders who sealed the covenant with Nehemiah during the post-exilic period in Jerusalem. After the Israelites had returned from Babylonian captivity, Nehemiah led the people in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem and restoring the city. 

As part of the spiritual renewal that accompanied the physical restoration, the Israelites gathered to hear the Law of Moses read aloud and to confess their sins. They then made a covenant to follow God's law, promising to obey His commandments and to maintain the purity of their community. 

Nebai was among the leaders who signed and sealed this covenant, along with priests, Levites, and other officials. By affixing their seals to the document, these leaders demonstrated their commitment to upholding the covenant and their willingness to lead the people in obedience to God's law. 

Apart from this single mention, no further information is provided about Nebai's background, family, or specific role within the community. However, his inclusion in the list of leaders who sealed the covenant indicates that he held a position of influence and responsibility among the Israelites during this important time of renewal and reformation.
