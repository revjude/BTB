Ahithophel was a highly respected counselor to King David, known for his wisdom and insight. His advice was regarded as if one had inquired of the word of God. \(2Sa.16.23\) He was also the grandfather of Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite, whom David later married after Uriah's death. \([[2Sam.23.34|2Sa.23.34]]\) 

However, during Absalom's rebellion against David, Ahithophel defected and joined Absalom's side. \([[2Sam.15.12|2Sa.15.12]]\) When David learned of Ahithophel's betrayal, he prayed that God would turn Ahithophel's counsel into foolishness. \(2Sa.15.31\). 

Absalom sought Ahithophel's advice on how to proceed against David. Ahithophel counseled Absalom to pursue David immediately and strike him down while he was weak and vulnerable. \([[2Sam.17.1|2Sa.17.1]]-4\) However, Absalom also sought the advice of Hushai the Archite, who was secretly loyal to David. Hushai convinced Absalom to delay the attack, giving David time to regroup and strengthen his forces. \(2Sa.17.5-14\) 

When Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he returned to his home, put his household in order, and hanged himself, realizing that Absalom's cause was doomed to fail. \([[2Sam.17.23|2Sa.17.23]]\) 

Ahithophel's betrayal and subsequent suicide are seen as a fulfillment of David's prayer and demonstrate the consequences of turning against God's anointed king. His story serves as a warning against pride, ambition, and disloyalty, and highlights the importance of seeking and following wise counsel that aligns with God's will.
