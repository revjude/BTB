Mysia was a region in the northwest of Asia Minor \(modern Turkey\), bordering the Aegean Sea. It is mentioned in the New Testament in connection with Paul's second missionary journey \(Acts 16:7-8\). Paul and his companions, including Silas and Timothy, had traveled throughout Phrygia and Galatia, but were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach in Asia. When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them. So, they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas, where Paul received a vision of a man from Macedonia asking for help, leading them to cross over to Europe.
