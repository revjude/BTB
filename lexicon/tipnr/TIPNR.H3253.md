Ismachiah is mentioned in [[2Chr.31.13|2 Chronicles 31:13]] as one of the overseers appointed by King Hezekiah during his reforms and restoration of the temple in Jerusalem. After Hezekiah cleansed and consecrated the temple, he appointed priests and Levites to their duties and organized the collection and distribution of tithes and offerings \(2Ch.31.2-12\). 

Ismachiah, along with several others, including Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah, was appointed as an overseer under the direction of Conaniah and his brother Shimei. These men were entrusted with the task of distributing the contributions to their fellow priests and Levites faithfully. 

The inclusion of Ismachiah's name in this list highlights the importance of organization and oversight in the administration of the temple and its services. It also demonstrates Hezekiah's commitment to restoring proper worship and supporting the religious leaders of Judah.
