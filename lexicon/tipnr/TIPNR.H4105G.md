Mehetabel was the wife of Hadar \(or Hadad\), who was the last king of Edom mentioned in the genealogy of Esau. She was the daughter of Matred and the granddaughter of Me-zahab \([[Gen.36.39|Genesis 36:39]]; [[1Chr.1.50|1 Chronicles 1:50]]\). The Edomites were descendants of Esau, the twin brother of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\), and they settled in the region southeast of Judah. The mention of Mehetabel in the genealogy suggests that she held a significant position as the queen of Edom during her husband's reign. However, no further details about her life or role are provided in the biblical text.
