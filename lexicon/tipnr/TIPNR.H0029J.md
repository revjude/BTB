<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Abiah</span> was the son of Hezron, born after his father's death in Caleb-ephrathah.
- A woman from the tribe of Judah  living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, only mentioned at [[1Chr.2.24|1Ch.2.24]]; 
- only referred to as Abiah **<big>[[H0029|אֲבִיָּה]]</big>**; 
- wife of Hezron **<big>[[H2696|חֶצְרוֹן]]</big>**; 
-  mother of Ashhur **<big>[[H0806|אַשְׁחוּר]]</big>**.

Abiah is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.2.24|1 Chronicles 2:24]] as the son of Hezron. The text states that Hezron's wife Abijah bore Abiah to him after his death in Caleb-ephrathah. This suggests that Abiah was conceived before Hezron's death but was born posthumously. Abiah is listed within the genealogy of the tribe of Judah, but no other information is provided about his life or descendants.
