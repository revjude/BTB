- A woman from the tribe of Judah  living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, only mentioned at [[1Chr.2.24|1Ch.2.24]];

Abiah is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.2.24|1 Chronicles 2:24]] as the son of Hezron. The text states that Hezron's wife Abijah bore Abiah to him after his death in Caleb-ephrathah. This suggests that Abiah was conceived before Hezron's death but was born posthumously. Abiah is listed within the genealogy of the tribe of Judah, but no other information is provided about his life or descendants.
