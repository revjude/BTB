Zaccur, the son of Shammua, was a member of the tribe of Reuben. He was chosen as one of the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan before the Israelites entered it. Each tribe was represented by a leader in this scouting mission. Zaccur and the other spies were tasked with assessing the land, its inhabitants, and its resources. After forty days, the spies returned with their report. While Zaccur's specific role in the mission is not detailed, the majority of the spies, except for Joshua and Caleb, delivered a discouraging report that led to the Israelites' refusal to enter the land, resulting in forty years of wandering in the wilderness.
