- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.11.16|Neh.11.16]]; 
- only referred to as Jozabad **<big>[[H3107|יוֹזָבָד]]</big>**.

Jozabad is mentioned in [[Neh.11.16|Nehemiah 11:16]] as one of the leaders of the Levites who were in charge of the outside work of the house of God. The context of the passage is the listing of the people who settled in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile \(Nehemiah 11:1-36\). 

Jozabad, along with Shabbethai, is described as being in charge of the outside work of the house of God \([[Neh.11.16|Nehemiah 11:16]]\). This likely involved overseeing maintenance, repairs, and other tasks related to the exterior of the temple complex. 

The mention of Jozabad's role highlights the various responsibilities of the Levites in maintaining and serving in the temple.
