The Philistines were an ancient people who lived in the coastal plain of Canaan, primarily in the region known as Philistia, which corresponds to the modern-day Gaza Strip and the southern coast of Israel. They are first mentioned in the Bible during the time of Abraham \(Gen. 21:32, 34\) and Isaac \(Gen. 26:1, 8, 14-15, 18\). The Philistines were not part of the original inhabitants of Canaan and are believed to have migrated from the Aegean region, possibly as part of the Sea Peoples' movement in the 12th century BC. 

Throughout the period of the judges and the early monarchy, the Philistines were a constant threat to the Israelites. They oppressed Israel for 40 years until Samson began to deliver them \(Judg. 13:1, 5\). Samson's encounters with the Philistines, including his marriage to a Philistine woman and his final act of bringing down the temple of Dagon, are recorded in Judges 14-16. During the time of Samuel, the Philistines defeated Israel and captured the Ark of the Covenant \(1 Sam. 4\). They were later forced to return the Ark after experiencing plagues \(1 Sam. 5-6\). 

The Philistines continued to be a significant enemy during the reigns of Saul and David. The famous battle between David and the Philistine giant Goliath took place during this time \(1 Sam. 17\). David fought against the Philistines throughout his reign \(2 Sam. 5; 8:1, 12; 21; 23\), and they remained a threat until the later years of the divided monarchy \(2 Kgs. 18:8; 2 Chr. 26:6-7; 28:18\). The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Amos, and Zephaniah all mention the Philistines in their oracles, often pronouncing judgment against them \(Isa. 14:29-31; Jer. 47; Ezek. 25:15-17; Amos 1:8; Zeph. 2:5\). 

The Philistines were known for their advanced iron technology, their distinctive pottery, and their religious practices, which included the worship of deities such as Dagon, Ashtoreth, and Baal-Zebub. The biblical narrative portrays them as a formidable enemy of Israel, but also as a people whom God used to test and discipline His chosen nation.
