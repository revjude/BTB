- A man living at the time of United Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Kgs.11.23|1Ki.11.23]]; 
- only referred to as Rezon **<big>[[H7331|רְזוֹן]]</big>**; 
- a son of Eliada **<big>[[H0450|אֶלְיָדָע]]</big>**.

Rezon, the son of Eliada, was an adversary of Solomon, king of Israel \([[1Kgs.11.23|1 Kings 11:23]]\). He had fled from his master, Hadadezer, king of Zobah, when David defeated Hadadezer's army \([[1Kgs.11.23|1 Kings 11:23]]-24; 2 Samuel 8:3-8\). Rezon gathered a band of men and became their leader, eventually establishing himself as king in Damascus, the capital of Aram \(Syria\) \(1 Kings 11:24\). Throughout Solomon's reign, Rezon was an adversary to Israel, causing trouble alongside another of Solomon's adversaries, Hadad the Edomite \(1 Kings 11:25\). The hostility between Rezon and Solomon was likely due to Solomon's control over the trade routes and his expanding influence in the region. The rise of Rezon as king of Aram and his opposition to Israel set the stage for the ongoing conflicts between the two kingdoms in the following centuries, as seen in the accounts of later kings of Israel and Judah.
