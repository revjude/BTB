Kabzeel was a town located in the Negev, the southern region of Judah \([[Josh.15.21|Joshua 15:21]]\). It is most notable as the hometown of Benaiah, one of King David's mighty men \([[2Sam.23.20|2 Samuel 23:20]]; [[1Chr.11.22|1 Chronicles 11:22]]\). Benaiah was known for his bravery and skill in battle, as he killed two warriors of Moab and a lion in a pit on a snowy day. He also killed an Egyptian of great stature, using only a staff to disarm him and slay him with his own spear. Benaiah later became the commander of David's bodyguard \(2 Samuel 23:23\). Its location is unknown.
