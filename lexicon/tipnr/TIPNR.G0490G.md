Antioch, located in Syria, was a significant city in the early spread of Christianity. After the persecution that followed Stephen's martyrdom, some believers from Cyprus and Cyrene came to Antioch and preached the gospel to the Hellenists \(Greeks\) there \(Acts 11:19-20\). The church in Jerusalem sent Barnabas to Antioch, who encouraged the believers and brought Saul \(Paul\) there to teach \(Acts 11:22-26\). 

It was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians \(Acts 11:26\). The city became a hub for missionary activity, with Paul and Barnabas being sent out from Antioch on their first missionary journey \(Acts 13:1-3; 14:26\). The church in Antioch also played a crucial role in the Jerusalem Council, which addressed the issue of Gentile believers and the Mosaic Law \(Acts 15:1-35\). 

Antioch was the home church of several notable figures, including the prophet Agabus \(Acts 11:27-28\) and the evangelist Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch \(Acts 6:5\). The apostle Peter visited Antioch, where Paul confronted him about his inconsistent behavior regarding Gentile believers \([[Gal.2.11|Galatians 2:11]]-14\). 

The church in Antioch became a model of a multicultural, mission-oriented congregation, demonstrating the power of the gospel to transcend cultural barriers and unite believers in Christ. Its strategic location and the fervor of its believers made Antioch a launching pad for the spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire.
