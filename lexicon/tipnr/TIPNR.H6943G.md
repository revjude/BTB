Kedesh, also known as Kedesh-naphtali, was a significant city in the northern part of Canaan. It was originally a Canaanite city, ruled by a king who was defeated by Joshua during the conquest of the land \([[Josh.12.22|Joshua 12:22]]\). After the conquest, Kedesh was allotted to the tribe of Naphtali \([[Josh.19.37|Joshua 19:37]]\) and designated as a Levitical city \([[Josh.21.32|Joshua 21:32]]\) and a city of refuge \([[Josh.20.7|Joshua 20:7]]\). Cities of refuge were established to provide sanctuary for those who accidentally killed someone, protecting them from revenge until a proper trial could be held. Kedesh was also the hometown of Barak, who, along with Deborah, led the Israelites to victory against Sisera and the Canaanites \(Judges 4:6, 9-11\). The city was later captured by Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria, during his invasion of Israel \([[2Kgs.15.29|2 Kings 15:29]]\). The exact location of Kedesh is disputed, but it is generally identified with the modern-day site of Tel Kedesh, located in the Upper Galilee region of Israel, near the border with Lebanon.
