He is listed among the descendants of Korah who were assigned the responsibility of guarding the thresholds of the tent of meeting. The gatekeepers played a crucial role in maintaining the sanctity and security of the tabernacle, ensuring that only authorized personnel could enter and that the sacred space remained protected. Hilkiah's service as a gatekeeper demonstrates the importance of the Levites' roles in the worship and maintenance of the tabernacle.
