Naaman is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.8.7|1 Chronicles 8:7]] as one of the sons of Ehud, a descendant of Benjamin. This reference appears in a genealogical record that traces the lineage of the tribe of Benjamin, providing insight into the family lines within the tribe. 

The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 8 lists several generations of Benjamites, focusing on the descendants of Bela, Ashbel, Aharah, Nohah, and Rapha. Naaman is identified as a son of Ehud, who is a descendant of Bela. 

Apart from being listed as a son of Ehud, no additional information is provided about Naaman's life, character, or role within the tribe of Benjamin. His mention in the genealogy serves primarily to establish his place within the family line and to contribute to the overall record of the tribe's history and development. 

The inclusion of Naaman in this genealogical record demonstrates the importance of family heritage and tribal identity in ancient Israelite society. These records helped establish the legitimacy of land claims, leadership roles, and the preservation of the tribe's history and connection to their ancestors.
