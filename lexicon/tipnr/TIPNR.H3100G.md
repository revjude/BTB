Joel was the firstborn son of the prophet and judge Samuel, as mentioned in [[1Sam.8.2|1 Samuel 8:2]]. Along with his brother Abijah, Joel was appointed by Samuel to serve as a judge in Israel. However, unlike their father, Joel and Abijah did not walk in the ways of the Lord. They turned aside after dishonest gain, accepted bribes, and perverted justice \(1Sa.8.3\). This corruption in leadership led the elders of Israel to demand a king to rule over them, ultimately resulting in the anointing of Saul as the first king of Israel \(1Sa.8.4-5\). The failure of Joel and Abijah to uphold the standards of righteous judgment set by their father had significant consequences for the nation of Israel.
