- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.8.2|Ezr.8.2]]; 
- only referred to as Daniel<[[H1841G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ָּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ֵּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>אל</span>, <span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ָּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>ֵ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>\).

Daniel is mentioned in [[Ezra.8.2|Ezra 8:2]] and [[Neh.10.6|Nehemiah 10:6]] as a priest who returned to Jerusalem from the Babylonian exile. In [[Ezra.8.2|Ezra 8:2]], he is listed among the descendants of Ithamar, one of Aaron's sons, indicating his priestly lineage. This Daniel was part of the group that returned to Jerusalem with Ezra, who led a significant return of exiles during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia. 

In [[Neh.10.6|Nehemiah 10:6]], Daniel is mentioned again as one of the priests who signed the covenant to follow the Law of God. This covenant was made after Ezra had read the Book of the Law to the people, and they had confessed their sins and committed to obeying God's commands. 

The fact that Daniel is mentioned in both Ezra and Nehemiah suggests that he played a role in the religious life of the Jewish community after the exile. As a priest, he would have been involved in the Temple service and in teaching the people the Law of God. 

Apart from these two references, no other details about this Daniel's life or ministry are provided in the Bible. It is important to note that this Daniel is a different person from the more well-known prophet Daniel, who lived earlier during the Babylonian exile.
