- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.12.14|Neh.12.14]]; 
- only referred to as Jonathan<[[H3129J]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יו</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ת</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ן</span>\).

In [[Neh.12.14|Nehemiah 12:14]], Jonathan is listed as the head of the priestly family of Malluchi \(or Malluch\) during the days of Joiakim the high priest. This was in the post-exilic period after the return from Babylon, likely in the late 5th century BC. The priests were organized into groupings called families, with a head over each family. Nehemiah 12 records the heads of priestly families in the generations after the first exiles returned under Jeshua the high priest \(Nehemiah 12:1-7\) and then in the time of the high priest Joiakim \(Nehemiah 12:12-21\).
