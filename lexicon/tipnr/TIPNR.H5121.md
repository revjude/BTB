Naioth was a place near Ramah, a city in the territory of Benjamin, where the prophet Samuel lived with a group of prophets \(1 Sam. 19:18-24; 20:1\). When King Saul sought to kill David, he fled to Samuel at Naioth in Ramah. Saul sent messengers to capture David, but when they arrived, they encountered the prophets prophesying with Samuel. The Spirit of God came upon the messengers, and they also prophesied. This happened three times, and when Saul himself went to Naioth, he too was overcome by the Spirit and prophesied before Samuel. This event gave rise to the saying, "Is Saul also among the prophets?" \(1 Sam. 19:24\).
