Mount Mizar is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Psalm 42:6, as part of a psalm of lament expressing the writer's longing for God's presence. The psalmist, one of the sons of Korah, remembers God from the land of the Jordan, the peaks of Hermon, and the Mount of Mizar. The exact location of Mount Mizar is unknown, and it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. Some scholars suggest that it may be a reference to a smaller hill or peak in the vicinity of Mount Hermon, while others propose that it could be a symbolic name representing a place of remembrance or spiritual significance for the psalmist. The name "Mizar" comes from a Hebrew word meaning "littleness" or "insignificance," which may indicate the psalmist's sense of humility or despair in the face of his circumstances.
