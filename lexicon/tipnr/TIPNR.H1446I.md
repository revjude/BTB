<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Gedor</span> was a son of Abiel \(or 'Jeiel'\), the  father \(ie re-founder\) of Gibeon, and an ancestor of King Saul.
- A man from the tribe of Benjamin living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Chr.8.31|1Ch.8.31]]; 
- only referred to as Gedor<[[H1446I]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ג</span>ְּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>דו</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>\); 
-  son of Abiel<[[H0022G]]> and Maacah<[[H4601N]]>; 
- a brother of Kish<[[H7027G]]>, Ner<[[H5369G]]>, Abdon<[[H5658J]]>, Zur<[[H6698I]]>, Baal<[[H1168B]]>, Nadab<[[H5070J]]>, Ahio<[[H0283I]]>, Zecher<[[H2144]]> and Mikloth<[[H4732G]]>.

Gedor is mentioned in [[1Chr.8.31|1 Chronicles 8:31]] and 9:37 as one of the sons of Abiel \(or 'Jeiel'\), the  father \(ie re-founder\) of Gibeon. Gibeon was a Levitical city located in the territory of Benjamin \(Joshua 21:17\). The genealogies in 1 Chronicles 8 and 9 trace the lineage of King Saul, who was from the tribe of Benjamin. Gedor is listed among Jeiel's sons, along with Abdon, Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab, Zechariah, and Mikloth \(1 Chronicles 8:30-31; 9:36-37\). These genealogies demonstrate Saul's Benjamite heritage and his connection to the city of Gibeon. The repetition of the genealogy in both chapters suggests the importance of establishing Saul's lineage and the significance of the Benjamite tribe in Israel's history.
