Parshandatha was one of the ten sons of Haman, the enemy of the Jews, who was killed when the Jews defended themselves from their enemies, as recorded in [[Esth.9.7|Esther 9:7]]. After Haman plotted to destroy the Jews throughout the Persian empire, they were granted permission by King Xerxes to fight back against anyone who attacked them. On the appointed days, the 13th and 14th of the month of Adar, the Jews struck down their enemies, including Parshandatha and his brothers.
