The Tigris River is one of the four rivers mentioned in the biblical account of the Garden of Eden \(Gen. 2:14\). It is described as flowing from Eden, along with the Euphrates, Pishon, and Gihon. The Tigris and Euphrates are the two major rivers of Mesopotamia, and their identification is certain. In the Book of Daniel, the Tigris River is mentioned as the location where Daniel received a vision \(Dan. 10:4\). Daniel, who had been exiled to Babylon, was standing on the bank of the Tigris when he saw a man dressed in linen and heard a message concerning future events. The Tigris River originates in the mountains of eastern Turkey and flows through Iraq before joining the Euphrates to form the Shatt al-Arab, which empties into the Persian Gulf. The river was important for ancient civilizations such as the Assyrians and Babylonians, providing water for irrigation and serving as a major transportation route.
