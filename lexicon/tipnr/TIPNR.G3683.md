- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[2Tim.1.16|2Ti.1.16]]; 
- only referred to as Onesiphorus **<big>[[G3683|Ὀνησίφορος]]</big>**.

Onesiphorus was a Christian friend and supporter of the apostle Paul \([[2Tim.1.16|2 Timothy 1:16]]\). He is mentioned in Paul's second letter to Timothy as someone who often refreshed Paul and was not ashamed of his chains \([[2Tim.1.16|2 Timothy 1:16]]\). This suggests that Onesiphorus visited Paul during his imprisonment and provided him with comfort and support. Paul expresses his gratitude for Onesiphorus' kindness and asks the Lord to grant mercy to his household \([[2Tim.1.16|2 Timothy 1:16]]\). In the final chapter of the letter, Paul sends greetings to the household of Onesiphorus \([[2Tim.4.19|2 Timothy 4:19]]\), indicating that Onesiphorus and his family were well-known to the Christian community. The example of Onesiphorus highlights the importance of supporting and encouraging those who are facing hardship or persecution for their faith.
