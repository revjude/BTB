People from Sin\(?\)

The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Sinites</span> were a Canaanite people group descended from Canaan, the son of Ham.
- People from Sin\(?\) of the Canaanites, first mentioned at [[Gen.10.17|Gen.10.17]]; 
- only referred to as Sinites<[[H5513]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ס</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ינ</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>\); 
- descended from Canaan<[[H3667G]]> along with Sidon<[[H6721G]]>, Heth<[[H2845]]>, Jebusites<[[H2983G]]>, Amorites<[[H0567]]>, Girgashites<[[H1622]]>, Hivites<[[H2340]]>, Arkites<[[H6208]]>, Arvadites<[[H0721]]>, Zemarites<[[H6786]]> and Hamathites<[[H2577]]>.

The Sinites are mentioned in [[Gen.10.17|Genesis 10:17]] and [[1Chr.1.15|1 Chronicles 1:15]] as one of the descendants of Canaan, the son of Ham and grandson of Noah. They are listed among the Canaanite tribes, which also included the Sidonians, Hittites, Jebusites, Amorites, and others. The Sinites were part of the people groups that inhabited the land of Canaan before the Israelites' arrival. The exact location of their territory is not specified in the Bible, and little is known about their culture or history. As Canaanites, they were among the people groups that God promised to drive out of the land to give to the Israelites \(Exodus 23:23; Deuteronomy 7:1\). The mention of the Sinites in the Table of Nations \(Genesis 10\) and the genealogy of Chronicles serves to highlight the diverse people groups that descended from Noah's sons and populated the ancient Near East.
