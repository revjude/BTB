- A man living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Sam.8.10|2Sa.8.10]]; 
- referred to as Joram **<big>[[H3141|יוֹרָם]]</big>**, or Hadoram **<big>[[H1913|הֲדוֹרָם]]</big>**; 
- a son of Toi **<big>[[H8583|תֹּעוּ]]</big>**.

Joram, also called Hadoram, was the son of King Toi of Hamath, a city and region north of Israel. After King David defeated Hadadezer, king of Zobah, King Toi sent his son Joram to David with articles of silver, gold, and bronze as a gesture of congratulations and friendship \(2 Samuel 8:9-10; 1 Chronicles 18:9-10\). Hadadezer had been at war with Toi, so Toi was pleased at his enemy's defeat. The expensive gifts were likely intended to gain David's favor and establish good relations between their kingdoms. The Bible records no other actions or events in Joram/Hadoram's life beyond this diplomatic mission to David, which probably took place sometime in the early 10th century BC.
