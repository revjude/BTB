The Elah Valley was the location of the memorable confrontation between David and the Philistine champion Goliath \(1 Samuel 17\). The Philistines gathered their armies there to battle against King Saul and the Israelites. 

The valley was situated on the border between Judah and Philistia, near the city of Azekah. It was likely an open area suitable for battle. David, then a young shepherd boy, arrived at the Israelite camp and accepted Goliath's challenge. With a sling and a stone, David struck down Goliath, and the Philistines fled in defeat. 

After this victory, the Elah Valley became famous as the site of David's triumph and the place where he launched his ascent to the throne. The "sword of Goliath" that David took from the fallen giant was kept in Nob, and David later retrieved it when fleeing from Saul \([[1Sam.21.9|1 Samuel 21:9]]\).
