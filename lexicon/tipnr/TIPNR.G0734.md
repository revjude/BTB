<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Artemas</span> was a companion of Paul who could potentially replace Titus in Crete \([[Titus.3.12|Titus 3:12]]\).
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Titus.3.12|Tit.3.12]]; 
- only referred to as Artemas<[[G0734]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ἀρτεμάς</span>\).

Artemas was a Christian mentioned by Paul in his letter to Titus. Paul stated that he might send Artemas or Tychicus to Titus, presumably to assist or replace him in his work on the island of Crete. This suggests that Artemas was a trusted colleague of Paul and capable of handling important responsibilities in the early church.
