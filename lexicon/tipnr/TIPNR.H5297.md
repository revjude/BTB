Memphis was an important city in ancient Egypt, located south of modern Cairo. It served as the capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom period and remained a significant cultural and religious center throughout much of Egyptian history. In the Bible, Memphis is mentioned primarily in the context of prophecies against Egypt. The prophet Isaiah speaks of the princes of Memphis as being deceived and leading Egypt astray \([[Isa.19.13|Isaiah 19:13]]\). Jeremiah mentions Memphis as one of the cities where the Jews fled to escape the Babylonian invasion, but he warns that they will not find safety there \([[Jer.2.16|Jeremiah 2:16]]; 44:1; 46:14, 19\). Ezekiel prophesies that God will execute judgments against the idols and princes of Memphis \([[Ezek.30.13|Ezekiel 30:13]], 16\). Hosea also refers to Memphis \(Moph\) as a place where the Israelites will be exiled and will die \([[Hos.9.6|Hosea 9:6]]\).
