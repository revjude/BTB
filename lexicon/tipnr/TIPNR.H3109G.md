Joha is briefly mentioned in [[1Chr.8.16|1 Chronicles 8:16]] as one of the sons of Beriah, a descendant of Benjamin. He is listed among the Benjaminite clan heads who lived in Jerusalem. This genealogical record in 1 Chronicles traces the lineage of King Saul and provides insight into the family structure and settlement patterns of the tribe of Benjamin. The mention of Joha and his brothers living in Jerusalem suggests that they may have held positions of leadership or influence within their clan. However, no additional information is provided about Joha's life, his specific role within the clan, or any notable achievements.
