Naphath was a region within the territory of Issachar that contained several towns allotted to the tribe of Manasseh \(Josh. 17:11\). These towns included Beth-shean, Ibleam, Dor, Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo, along with their surrounding villages. Although geographically within Issachar, these towns were under the control of Manasseh, as part of the inheritance of the daughters of Zelophehad \(Num. 27:1-11; Josh. 17:3-6\).
