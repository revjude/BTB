Zechariah was a prophet and priest who lived in Judah after the Babylonian exile. He was the son of Berechiah and grandson of Iddo, a priest who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel. Zechariah began his prophetic ministry in the second year of Darius, king of Persia, delivering messages to encourage the people to rebuild the temple. His prophecies, recorded in the biblical book bearing his name, are known for their rich use of visions and symbolism, similar to the books of Daniel and Revelation. Zechariah's ministry likely extended into the reign of Xerxes I, the king who made Esther queen of Persia. As both a prophet and priest, Zechariah would have had intimate knowledge of Jewish religious practices.
