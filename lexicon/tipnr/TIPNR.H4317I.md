Michael is mentioned briefly in the genealogy of the tribe of Gad in the book of 1 Chronicles \([[1Chr.5.14|1Ch.5.14]]\). He is listed as a descendant of Abihail, along with his relatives: Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jachan, Zia, and Eber. These seven men are described as chiefs of the Gadites, brave warriors, famous men, and heads of their fathers' houses \(1Ch.5.13-14\). The Gadites were known for their military skill and settled in the land of Bashan, east of the Jordan River \(1Ch.5.18-22\). No additional information about Michael's life, exploits, or role within the Gadite community is provided in the biblical text. His inclusion in the genealogy serves to trace the lineage and leadership of the tribe of Gad.
