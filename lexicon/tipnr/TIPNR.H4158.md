Mephaath was a city located in the territory of Reuben, east of the Dead Sea \([[Josh.13.18|Joshua 13:18]]\). It was designated as a Levitical city, given to the Merarite clan \([[Josh.21.37|Joshua 21:37]]; [[1Chr.6.79|1 Chronicles 6:79]]\). The Levites were assigned cities throughout Israel to live in and serve the people. In later history, Mephaath appears to have come under Moabite control, as it is mentioned in Jeremiah's prophecy against Moab \([[Jer.48.21|Jeremiah 48:21]]\). The exact location of Mephaath is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the plateau region east of the Dead Sea.
