Helkath-hazzurim, meaning "Field of Swords" or "Field of Hostilities," was the name given to a site where a battle took place between the men of David and those of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul \(2 Sam 2:16\). After Saul's death, Ish-bosheth was proclaimed king over Israel, while David was anointed as king over Judah. The battle at Helkath-hazzurim was part of the ongoing conflict between the two factions. Twelve men from each side were chosen to fight in hand-to-hand combat, and they killed each other simultaneously. This led to a fierce battle in which David's men, under the leadership of Joab, defeated Abner and the men of Israel. The exact location of Helkath-hazzurim is not specified, but it was likely near Gibeon, where the two armies initially confronted each other \(2 Sam 2:13\).
