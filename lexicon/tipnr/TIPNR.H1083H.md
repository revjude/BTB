Bilgah, also known as Bilgai, was a priest who returned to Jerusalem from the Babylonian exile \(Neh. 12:5\). He is mentioned among the priests who settled in Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah. Later, Bilgai, likely the same person as Bilgah, is listed among the priests who sealed the covenant during Nehemiah's reforms \(Neh. 10:8\). The covenant was a solemn agreement made by the returned exiles to follow the Law of God and maintain their distinct identity as God's chosen people. By sealing the covenant, Bilgah/Bilgai and the other priests pledged to uphold its terms, which included observing the Sabbath, avoiding intermarriage with foreigners, and supporting the temple service. Bilgah/Bilgai's presence as a priest during this significant period highlights the importance of the priestly role in the restoration of Jerusalem and the spiritual renewal of the Jewish community after the exile.
