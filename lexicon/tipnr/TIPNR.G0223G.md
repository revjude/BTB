Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Alexander</span> was the son of Simon of Cyrene, who was compelled to carry Jesus' cross. \([[Mark.15.21|Mrk.15.21]]\)
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Mark.15.21|Mrk.15.21]]; 
- only referred to as Alexander **<big>[[G0223|Ἀλέξανδρος]]</big>**; 
-  son of Simon **<big>[[G4613|Σίμων]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Rufus **<big>[[G4504|Ῥοῦφος]]</big>**.

Alexander is mentioned briefly in the Gospel of Mark as the son of Simon of Cyrene, along with his brother Rufus. \([[Mark.15.21|Mrk.15.21]]\) 

Simon of Cyrene, their father, was a passerby who was coming from the country when he encountered the procession leading Jesus to the crucifixion site. The Roman soldiers compelled Simon to carry Jesus' cross, likely because Jesus was exhausted from the physical abuse he had endured. \([[Mark.15.21|Mrk.15.21]]\) 

The mention of Alexander and Rufus suggests that they were known to the early Christian community for which Mark wrote his Gospel. The fact that they are named indicates that they may have become followers of Jesus or were at least familiar to the readers of the Gospel. 

Cyrene was a city in present-day Libya, and the presence of Simon and his sons in Jerusalem during the Passover festival suggests that they were Jewish pilgrims who had come to celebrate the feast. 

Apart from this brief mention, no further information is provided about Alexander's life, his reaction to his father's involvement in Jesus' crucifixion, or his subsequent role in the early Christian community. 

The inclusion of Alexander and Rufus in the Gospel narrative serves to provide a historical detail and to connect the story of Jesus' crucifixion to individuals who were known to the early church.
