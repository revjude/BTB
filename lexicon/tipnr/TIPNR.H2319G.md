The New Gate was one of the gates of Jerusalem mentioned in the book of Jeremiah \(Jer. 26:10; 36:10\). It was located near the temple and served as a place where legal proceedings and public announcements took place. In Jeremiah 26, the princes of Judah sat in judgment at the entrance of the New Gate after Jeremiah had prophesied against the city and the temple. Later, in Jeremiah 36, Baruch read the scroll of Jeremiah's prophecies in the chamber of Gemariah, which was located in the upper court at the entry of the New Gate. The exact location and appearance of the New Gate are not described in detail in the Bible.
