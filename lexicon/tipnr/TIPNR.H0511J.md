Elkanah is mentioned in the genealogies of the Levites as a descendant of Kohath, the son of Levi \([[1Chr.6.26|1Ch.6.26]],35\). He appears in the lineage traced from Kohath to the prophet Samuel and his descendants. This Elkanah is distinct from the other Elkanahs mentioned in the genealogies, as he occupies a different position in the family line. The purpose of mentioning Elkanah in these passages is to provide a comprehensive genealogical record of the Levites, particularly the Kohathite clan, and to demonstrate the lineage of notable figures such as Samuel. The Bible does not provide any further details about this Elkanah's life, role, or contributions within the Levite community.
