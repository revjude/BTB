Ebed-melech was an Ethiopian eunuch who served in the court of King Zedekiah during the final days of the kingdom of Judah. He played a significant role in rescuing the prophet Jeremiah from a life-threatening situation. 

When Jeremiah was thrown into a cistern by the officials who opposed his prophetic message, Ebed-melech learned of the prophet's plight \([[Jer.38.7|Jeremiah 38:7]]\). Recognizing the injustice of the situation, Ebed-melech courageously went to King Zedekiah and interceded on Jeremiah's behalf \([[Jer.38.8|Jeremiah 38:8]]-9\). 

The king granted Ebed-melech permission to rescue Jeremiah, and the Ethiopian eunuch took thirty men with him to the cistern \([[Jer.38.10|Jeremiah 38:10]]\). Ebed-melech showed compassion and resourcefulness by lowering old rags and worn-out clothes for Jeremiah to use as padding under the ropes.
