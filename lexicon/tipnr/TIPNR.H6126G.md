Akkub is mentioned briefly in the genealogy of the royal line of Judah, specifically as a descendant of King Jehoiachin, who was also known as Jeconiah. \([[1Chr.3.24|1Ch.3.24]]\) 

Jehoiachin, the son of King Jehoiakim, reigned in Judah for a short period before being deposed and exiled to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar. \(2Ki.24.8-15\) He spent many years in captivity, but later, Evil-merodach, the king of Babylon, released him from prison and showed him favor. \(2Ki.25.27-30\). 

The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 3 traces the descendants of Jehoiachin, demonstrating the continuity of the royal lineage even during the Babylonian exile. Akkub is listed among the sons of Elioenai, who was a descendant of Jehoiachin through his son Shealtiel. \(1Ch.3.22-24\) 

Apart from being mentioned in the genealogy, no further details are provided about Akkub's life, his role within the family, or any significant events associated with him. 

The inclusion of Akkub in the genealogy serves to document the ongoing lineage of the Davidic dynasty and to highlight the preservation of the royal family's records, even during the challenging period of the Babylonian exile.
