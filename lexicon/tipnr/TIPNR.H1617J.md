Gera \(or Heglam\) is mentioned in [[1Chr.8.7|1 Chronicles 8:7]] as one of the sons of Ehud, a Benjamite. The name "Gera" is mentioned twice in this verse, which has led some scholars to suggest that "Heglam" may be an alternative name for Gera or a scribal error. The context of this passage is the genealogy of Benjamin, with a focus on the descendants of Ehud. The verse states that Ehud's sons, including Gera \(or Heglam\), were among those who were carried into exile, likely referring to the Babylonian captivity in the 6th century BC. This detail suggests that Gera \(or Heglam\) lived during the time of the divided monarchy and witnessed the fall of the southern kingdom of Judah.
