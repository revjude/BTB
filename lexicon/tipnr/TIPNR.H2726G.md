- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Esth.1.10|Est.1.10]]; 
- only referred to as Harbona **<big>[[H2726|חַרְבוֹנָא]]</big>**.

Harbona is mentioned in [[Esth.1.10|Esther 1:10]] as one of the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus, the Persian king who ruled over a vast empire from India to Ethiopia. In the context of Esther 1, King Ahasuerus held a lavish banquet for all his officials and servants, displaying his wealth and splendor. On the seventh day of the feast, when the king was in high spirits from wine, he commanded the seven eunuchs, including Harbona, to bring Queen Vashti before him wearing her royal crown, to show off her beauty to the people and officials. However, Queen Vashti refused to come, defying the king's command. This incident led to Vashti's removal as queen and paved the way for Esther to become the new queen. The mention of Harbona as one of the seven eunuchs highlights the importance of these court officials in the Persian royal court and their role in carrying out the king's orders.
