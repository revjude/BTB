- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Col.4.18|Act.19.9]]; 
- only referred to as Tyrannus<[[G5181]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Τύραννος</span>\).

Tyrannus is mentioned briefly in Acts 19:9 as a teacher in Ephesus who hosted the Apostle Paul's daily discussions about the gospel. When some Jews in the synagogue became stubborn and spoke evil of the Way, Paul withdrew from the synagogue and began teaching in the lecture hall of Tyrannus. This arrangement continued for two years, allowing all the residents of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, to hear the word of the Lord. The name Tyrannus means "tyrant" or "sovereign" in Greek, possibly indicating his profession as a teacher or rhetorician. By providing a venue for Paul's teaching, Tyrannus played a role in the spread of the gospel in Ephesus and the surrounding region, even if inadvertently.
