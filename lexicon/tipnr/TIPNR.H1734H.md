Dodo, also known as Dodai, is mentioned in the Bible as the father of Eleazar, one of King David's mighty men. Eleazar is first introduced in [[2Sam.23.9|2 Samuel 23:9]] and [[1Chr.11.12|1 Chronicles 11:12]] as part of a list of David's most valiant warriors. 

In these passages, Eleazar is described as standing his ground and striking down the Philistines until his hand was weary and stuck to his sword. This event likely occurred during one of the many battles between Israel and the Philistines during David's reign. 

Eleazar's bravery and loyalty to David are further emphasized by his inclusion in this list of mighty men, which highlights the most exceptional and dedicated warriors who fought alongside the king. 

In [[1Chr.27.4|1 Chronicles 27:4]], Dodai the Ahohite is mentioned as the commander over the division for the second month in David's military organization. It is possible that this Dodai is the same person as Dodo, Eleazar's father, but this cannot be stated with certainty. 

The fact that Eleazar is consistently identified as the son of Dodo or Dodai suggests that his father was also well-known, either for his own military prowess or for his association with his son's achievements. However, no further information is provided about Dodo or Dodai beyond his connection to Eleazar.
