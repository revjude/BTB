High Priest living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Caiaphas</span>, the high priest during Jesus' ministry, presided over Jesus' trial and played a key role in His crucifixion.
- A High Priest living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Matt.26.3|Mat.26.3]]; 
- only referred to as Caiaphas<[[G2533G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Κα</span>ϊ<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>άφας</span>\).

Caiaphas was the high priest during the time of Jesus' ministry and played a significant role in the events leading to Jesus' crucifixion \(Matt. 26:3, 57; [[Luke.3.2|Luke 3:2]]; [[John.11.49|John 11:49]]; 18:13, 14, 24, 28; Acts 4:6\). He served as high priest from around AD 18 to 36, and was the son-in-law of Annas, another influential high priest. Caiaphas is most notable for his involvement in the trial of Jesus. After Jesus' arrest, He was brought before Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council. During this trial, Caiaphas questioned Jesus and ultimately charged Him with blasphemy \(Matt. 26:63-66\). Caiaphas then sent Jesus to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, who sentenced Him to crucifixion. Caiaphas' actions were motivated by his concern for maintaining political stability and protecting the religious establishment from perceived threats \([[John.11.49|John 11:49]]-50\). After Jesus' resurrection, Caiaphas was involved in the persecution of the early Christian church, as seen in the trial of Peter and John \(Acts 4:6\). Caiaphas' role in the Gospel narratives highlights the political and religious tensions of the time and the opposition faced by Jesus and His followers.
