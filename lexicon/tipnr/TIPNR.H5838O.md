Azariah is mentioned in [[2Chr.28.12|2 Chronicles 28:12]] as one of the leaders of Ephraim who opposed the bringing of captives from Judah into Samaria during the reign of King Ahaz. Israel had defeated Judah in battle and taken many captives, intending to enslave them. However, Azariah, along with Berechiah, Jehizkiah, and Amasa, confronted the army and reminded them of their own sins against God. They urged the army to release the captives, warning that God's fierce wrath would be upon them if they proceeded with their plan. The army listened to their words and released the captives, providing them with clothing, food, and medical care before sending them back to Judah. Azariah's actions demonstrate the importance of standing up against injustice and the power of wise counsel in preventing further sin and judgment.
