Zebul was the governor of the city of Shechem during the reign of Abimelech, the son of Gideon, who had declared himself king over Israel. When Gaal, son of Ebed, came to Shechem and incited the people against Abimelech, Zebul remained loyal to Abimelech and informed him of the rebellion. Acting on Abimelech's instructions, Zebul challenged Gaal to fight against Abimelech's forces. In the ensuing battle, Gaal and his followers were defeated, and Abimelech took control of the city. Zebul then drove out Gaal and his brothers from Shechem. Zebul's actions demonstrate his loyalty to Abimelech and his role in quelling the rebellion and maintaining Abimelech's authority over the city of Shechem. The narrative highlights the political tensions and power struggles that existed during the period of the judges.
