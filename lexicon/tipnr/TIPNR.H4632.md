Mearah is mentioned in [[Josh.13.4|Joshua 13:4]] as part of the description of the land that remained to be conquered by the Israelites. The verse states that the land of the Gebalites and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo-hamath, including Mearah of the Sidonians, was yet to be taken. The exact location and nature of Mearah are not specified in the Bible, but it is associated with the Sidonians, suggesting it was in the vicinity of the city of Sidon.
