Pochereth-hazzebaim is the name of a family mentioned in the lists of the returned exiles in [[Ezra.2.57|Ezra 2:57]] and [[Neh.7.59|Nehemiah 7:59]]. They are identified as descendants of Solomon's servants, a group distinct from the Israelites, Levites, and priests. Solomon's servants were likely individuals who had been assigned to work on the king's various projects and estates during his reign. The descendants of these servants returned to Jerusalem and Judah along with the other exiles after the Babylonian captivity. The name Pochereth-hazzebaim may refer to the head of the family or to a specific location or profession associated with the family. The exact meaning and origin of the name are uncertain. The inclusion of this family in the lists of the returned exiles highlights the diverse composition of the Jewish community that resettled in the land after the exile.
