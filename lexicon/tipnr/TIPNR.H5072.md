Nedabiah is listed among the descendants of King Jeconiah \(also known as Jehoiachin\) of Judah \([[1Chr.3.18|1 Chronicles 3:18]]\). Jeconiah was deposed and exiled to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar in 597 BC \(2 Kings 24:10-16\). The sons mentioned in the genealogy, including Nedabiah, were likely born during the exile in Babylon. The name Nedabiah means "Yahweh has impelled" or "Yahweh is bountiful". No other details are given about Nedabiah's life, offspring, or any roles he may have had among the exiled community. He was part of the royal lineage of David that continued in exile.
