Rogelim was a town in Gilead, east of the Jordan River, and the hometown of Barzillai the Gileadite. During Absalom's rebellion against King David, Barzillai, along with other supporters, brought supplies of food and provisions to David and his followers at Mahanaim \(2 Sa. 17:27-29\). After Absalom's defeat, when David returned to Jerusalem, Barzillai accompanied him to the Jordan River. David invited the elderly Barzillai to come with him to Jerusalem, but Barzillai declined due to his advanced age and returned to his home in Rogelim \(2 Sa. 19:31-39\). The exact location of Rogelim is unknown, but it was situated in the region of Gilead, east of the Jordan River.
