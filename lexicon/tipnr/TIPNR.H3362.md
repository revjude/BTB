Jokneam, also known as Jokmeam, was a Canaanite city mentioned in the book of Joshua. Its king was defeated by Joshua during the conquest of Canaan \([[Josh.12.22|Joshua 12:22]]\). The city was later allotted to the tribe of Zebulun \([[Josh.19.11|Joshua 19:11]]\) and was designated as a Levitical city, given to the Levites as a place to live \([[Josh.21.34|Joshua 21:34]]\). Jokneam was located in the western part of the Jezreel Valley, near the border between Zebulun and Manasseh. In [[1Kgs.4.12|1 Kings 4:12]], Jokneam is mentioned as being near Megiddo, suggesting its strategic location along important trade routes. The exact site of the ancient city is uncertain, but it is thought to be located at Tell Qeimun, a hill near modern-day Yokneam Illit in northern Israel.
