Parah was a city in the territory of Benjamin, mentioned only once in the Bible in the list of cities and towns allocated to the tribe during the division of the Promised Land under Joshua \(Josh. 18:23\). It was situated between the cities of Avvim and Ophrah. The exact location of Parah is uncertain, but some scholars identify it with Farah, a site located on Wady Farah, which runs into Wady Suweinit, approximately 3 miles northeast of Anata.
