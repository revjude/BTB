Seth, mentioned in [[Gen.4.25|Genesis 4:25]]-26, 5:3-8, [[1Chr.1.1|1 Chronicles 1:1]], [[Num.24.17|Numbers 24:17]], and [[Luke.3.38|Luke 3:38]], was the third son of Adam and Eve. He was born after the death of Abel, whom Cain had murdered. Eve named him Seth, saying, "God has appointed me another offspring instead of Abel, for Cain killed him." Seth became the ancestor of the righteous line of humanity, in contrast to Cain's descendants. When Seth was 105 years old, he became the father of Enosh, and he lived an additional 807 years, having other sons and daughters. In total, Seth lived 912 years. His descendants, including Enoch and Noah, are characterized as calling upon the name of the Lord. In [[Num.24.17|Numbers 24:17]], the oracle of Balaam refers to a star coming out of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and a scepter rising out of Israel, which some interpret as a reference to the Messiah descending from Seth's lineage. Seth's inclusion in the genealogy of Jesus in [[Luke.3.38|Luke 3:38]] further emphasizes his significance in the biblical narrative.
