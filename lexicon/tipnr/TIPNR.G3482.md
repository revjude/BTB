- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[John.1.45|Jhn.1.45]]; 
- only referred to as Nathanael **<big>[[G3482|Ναθαναήλ]]</big>**.

Nathanael, also identified as Bartholomew in the Synoptic Gospels, was one of the twelve disciples of Jesus Christ. He is introduced in the Gospel of John when Philip, who had just begun following Jesus, found Nathanael and told him, "We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph" \([[John.1.45|John 1:45]]\). 

Initially skeptical, Nathanael questioned, "Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?" \([[John.1.46|John 1:46]]\). However, when Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he declared, "Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit" \([[John.1.47|John 1:47]]\). Surprised, Nathanael asked how Jesus knew him, to which Jesus replied that he had seen him under the fig tree before Philip called him \([[John.1.48|John 1:48]]\). 

This revelation prompted Nathanael to confess, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel" \([[John.1.49|John 1:49]]\). Jesus commended Nathanael's faith and promised that he would see even greater things, alluding to the miracles and divine revelations that would follow. 

Nathanael is mentioned again in [[John.21.2|John 21:2]] as one of the disciples who went fishing with Peter after Jesus' resurrection. He was present when Jesus appeared to them on the shore of the Sea of Tiberias and performed the miraculous catch of fish. 

Although little is known about Nathanael's life beyond these brief mentions, his inclusion among the twelve disciples highlights his importance in Jesus' ministry. His initial skepticism and subsequent confession of faith demonstrate the transformative power of encountering Jesus and the depth of his commitment to following him. 

Tradition holds that Nathanael, under the name Bartholomew, went on to preach the gospel in various regions, including India and Armenia, where he is said to have been martyred for his faith.
