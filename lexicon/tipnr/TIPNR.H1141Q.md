- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.43|Ezr.10.43]];

Benaiah is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.43|Ezra 10:43]] as one of the men from the descendants of Nebo who had married foreign women during the Babylonian Exile. The context of the passage is Ezra's reform, which addressed the issue of intermarriage between the returned exiles and the surrounding nations. This practice was seen as a violation of God's law and a threat to the spiritual purity of the community. Ezra called for the people to confess their sin and separate themselves from their foreign wives and children. Benaiah is listed among those who had taken foreign wives, indicating his involvement in this practice.
