Abdi is listed in [[Ezra.10.26|Ezra 10:26]] as one of the descendants of Elam who had married foreign women during the time of Ezra. After the return from Babylonian exile, Ezra discovered that many Israelites, including priests and Levites, had intermarried with the neighboring peoples. This was contrary to God's law and threatened the purity and identity of the Israelite community. Ezra called the people to repentance and required those who had married foreign wives to separate from them. Abdi was among those who agreed to put away their foreign wives in obedience to Ezra's command.
