Rab-saris is mentioned as one of the Babylonian officials present at the capture of Jerusalem by the army of King Nebuchadnezzar \([[Jer.39.3|Jeremiah 39:3]], 13\). The name "Rab-saris" is likely a title meaning "chief eunuch" or "chief officer." After the city fell, Rab-saris, along with other officials such as Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, and Nebushazban, took up residence at the Middle Gate, a prominent location within Jerusalem. The presence of these high-ranking officials demonstrates the complete subjugation of Jerusalem to Babylonian authority. The specific duties and responsibilities of Rab-saris are not elaborated upon in the biblical text.
