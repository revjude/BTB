Othniel was the son of Kenaz and the nephew of Caleb, one of the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan \([[Josh.15.17|Joshua 15:17]]; [[Judg.1.13|Judges 1:13]]; [[1Chr.4.13|1 Chronicles 4:13]]\). He is described as the first judge of Israel, who delivered the people from the oppression of Cushan-Rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia \([[Judg.3.9|Judges 3:9]]-10\). Othniel's story begins when Caleb offers his daughter Achsah in marriage to whoever captures the city of Debir \(also known as Kiriath-Sepher\) \(Joshua 15:16; Judges 1:12\). Othniel successfully takes the city and marries Achsah \([[Josh.15.17|Joshua 15:17]]; [[Judg.1.13|Judges 1:13]]\). Later, when the Israelites fall into sin and are oppressed by Cushan-Rishathaim, they cry out to the Lord for help \(Judges 3:8-9\). God raises up Othniel as a deliverer, and the Spirit of the Lord comes upon him \(Judges 3:10\). Othniel goes to war against Cushan-Rishathaim and prevails, bringing peace to the land for forty years until his death \(Judges 3:10-11\). Othniel is also mentioned as the leader of the tribe of Judah during the reign of King David \([[1Chr.27.15|1 Chronicles 27:15]]\).
