- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Zech.7.2|Zec.7.2]]; 
- only referred to as Sharezer **<big>[[H8272|שַׁרְאֶצֶר]]</big>**.

Sharezer, mentioned in [[Zech.7.2|Zechariah 7:2]], was part of a delegation sent by the people of Bethel to the house of God to seek guidance from the priests and prophets. The delegation, which also included Regem-melech and his men, came to inquire about whether they should continue the practice of fasting and mourning in the fifth month, as they had been doing for many years. This fasting was likely associated with the commemoration of the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem. The prophet Zechariah responded to their inquiry by emphasizing the importance of true repentance, justice, and compassion rather than merely observing ritual fasts. The text does not provide any further details about Sharezer's background or his role within the delegation. However, his inclusion in this account highlights the significance of seeking divine guidance and the need for genuine devotion and obedience to God's commands.
