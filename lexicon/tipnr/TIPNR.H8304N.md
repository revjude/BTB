Seraiah, mentioned in Jeremiah 51:59-61, was the son of Neriah and the brother of Baruch, Jeremiah's scribe. He held the position of quartermaster, which likely involved overseeing supplies and provisions. In the fourth year of King Zedekiah's reign, Seraiah accompanied the king on a journey to Babylon, possibly for diplomatic purposes. Jeremiah entrusted Seraiah with a prophetic message written in a scroll, which he was to read aloud in Babylon and then tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates River. This symbolic act signified the future destruction of Babylon. Seraiah's role in this event demonstrates his trusted position and his willingness to carry out the prophet's instructions, even in a foreign land.
