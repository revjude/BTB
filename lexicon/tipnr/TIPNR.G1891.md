- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Phil.2.25|Php.2.25]]; 
- only referred to as Epaphroditus **<big>[[G1891|Ἐπαφρόδιτος]]</big>**.

Epaphroditus was a prominent member of the church in Philippi and a close associate of the apostle Paul. He is described as a beloved brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier \([[Phil.2.25|Php.2.25]]\), indicating his significant role in the ministry and his strong relationship with Paul. Epaphroditus was sent by the Philippian church to deliver a gift to Paul and to minister to his needs while he was in prison \([[Phil.4.18|Php.4.18]]\). This demonstrates the love and support of the Philippian believers towards Paul and their commitment to partnering with him in the gospel ministry. During his time with Paul, Epaphroditus became ill and nearly died \(Php.2.26,27\). This caused great concern and sorrow among the Philippians, who held him in high regard. However, God had mercy on him, and he recovered \(Php.2.27\). Paul commended Epaphroditus for his sacrificial service and urged the Philippians to receive him with joy and honor \(Php.2.29\). Epaphroditus's willingness to risk his life for the work of Christ and his dedication to serving Paul and the church make him an exemplary figure in the early Christian community. His story highlights the close bonds and mutual support within the body of Christ, even across distances, and the sacrificial nature of Christian service.
