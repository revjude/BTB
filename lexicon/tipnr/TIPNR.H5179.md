Nehushta is mentioned in [[2Kgs.24.8|2 Kings 24:8]] as the mother of King Jehoiachin \(also known as Jeconiah\) of Judah. She was the daughter of Elnathan, a prominent figure from Jerusalem. 

Jehoiachin ascended to the throne of Judah at the age of eighteen, following the death of his father, King Jehoiakim. However, his reign was short-lived, lasting only three months before the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II besieged Jerusalem and took Jehoiachin captive to Babylon \(2 Kings 24:10-12\). 

As the queen mother, Nehushta would have held a position of influence and respect within the royal court. In ancient Near Eastern societies, including Judah, the queen mother often played a significant role in political and religious affairs, sometimes even acting as a regent for her young son. 

The mention of Nehushta's father, Elnathan of Jerusalem, suggests that she came from a prominent family and may have had connections to the upper echelons of Judean society. This background could have contributed to her son's ascension to the throne, despite his young age. 

Nehushta's fate after her son's capture is not explicitly mentioned in the biblical text. However, it is likely that she, along with other members of the royal family and the Judean elite, was also taken into exile in Babylon \(2 Kings 24:15\). 

The inclusion of Nehushta's name and lineage in the account of Jehoiachin's reign highlights the importance of maternal ancestry in the royal line of Judah and provides insight into the political and social dynamics of the time.
