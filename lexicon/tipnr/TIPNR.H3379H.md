Jeroboam II was a king of Israel who reigned for 41 years, from around 786 to 746 BC. He was the son of Jehoash and the grandson of Jehoahaz. During his reign, Jeroboam II was able to restore some of Israel's former territories, extending the kingdom's boundaries to the "entrance of Hamath," as predicted by the prophet Jonah. 

Despite his military successes, Jeroboam II continued in the idolatrous practices of his predecessors, maintaining the worship of the golden calves in Bethel and Dan. The prophets Amos and Hosea, who were active during his reign, condemned the social injustice, religious corruption, and moral decay prevalent in Israel at the time. 

Jeroboam II's reign was marked by prosperity and stability, but this was followed by a period of decline and political turmoil after his death. His son Zechariah succeeded him but was assassinated after only six months on the throne.
