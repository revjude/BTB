Man living at the time of the Patriarchs

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Hul</span> was one of the sons of Aram and a grandson of Shem, mentioned in the genealogies of Genesis and 1 Chronicles.
- A man of the Syrians living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.10.23|Gen.10.23]]; 
- only referred to as Hul<[[H2343]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>חו</span>ּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>\); 
-  son of Aram<[[H0758G]]>; 
- a brother of Uz<[[H5780G]]>, Gether<[[H1666]]> and Mash<[[H4851]]>.

Hul is mentioned in [[Gen.10.23|Genesis 10:23]] and [[1Chr.1.17|1 Chronicles 1:17]] as one of the sons of Aram, who was a son of Shem, one of Noah's three sons. Hul is listed alongside his brothers Uz, Gether, and Mash \(or Meshech in 1 Chronicles\). 

The genealogies in Genesis 10 and 1 Chronicles 1 provide a record of the descendants of Noah's sons after the flood, tracing the origins of various nations and people groups. Hul's inclusion in these genealogies suggests that he was the ancestor of a specific people group or nation, although the Bible does not provide any further details about his descendants. 

As a grandson of Shem, Hul would have been part of the Semitic people, who are generally associated with the ancient Near East, including the regions of Mesopotamia, Syria, and Arabia. 

Apart from being mentioned in these genealogies, no other information is provided about Hul in the Bible. His inclusion in the record serves to highlight the development and spread of the human population after the flood and to trace the lineage of the Semitic people.
