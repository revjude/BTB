Shashak, mentioned in [[1Chr.8.14|1 Chronicles 8:14]] and 8:25, was a Benjamite leader who descended from Elpaal. He is listed in the genealogical records of the tribe of Benjamin, which trace the lineage of prominent figures within the tribe. In verse 14, Shashak is identified as one of the sons of Elpaal, along with his brothers Beriah and Shema. Later, in verse 25, Shashak is mentioned again as the son of Beriah and the father of Iphedeiah and Penuel. The repetition of Shashak's name in the genealogy emphasizes his significance within the Benjamite lineage. However, the text does not provide any specific details about Shashak's life, his role as a leader, or his achievements. The inclusion of his name in the genealogical record serves to establish the continuity of the Benjamite lineage and highlight the importance of family ties within the tribe.
