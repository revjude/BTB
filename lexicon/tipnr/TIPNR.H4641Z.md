Maaseiah is mentioned as an ancestor of Jaazaniah, who was associated with the Rechabites during the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah \([[Jer.35.4|Jer.35.4]]\). The Rechabites were a nomadic clan known for their adherence to the commands of their ancestor, Jonadab son of Rechab, which included abstaining from wine, not building houses, and not sowing crops \(Jer.35.6-7\). In the biblical account, Jeremiah uses the Rechabites' faithfulness to their ancestor's commands as a contrast to the disobedience of the people of Judah \(Jer.35.12-19\). Maaseiah's connection to the Rechabites through his descendant Jaazaniah suggests that he may have been part of this clan or associated with them in some way.
