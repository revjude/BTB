Uzziel was a Levite who lived during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. He was the son of Jeduthun. When Hezekiah ordered the cleansing and rededication of the temple, which had been neglected under previous kings, Uzziel was among the Levites who gathered to help. He, along with other Levites, worked to clean and purify the temple, remove the unclean items, and prepare it for proper worship once again.
