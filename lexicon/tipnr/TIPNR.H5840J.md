Azrikam was an official who served in the royal court of King Ahaz of Judah. He held the position of being in charge of the palace, which was an important role in the king's administration. [[2Chr.28.7|2 Chronicles 28:7]] records that Azrikam was killed by Zichri, a mighty warrior from Ephraim, during a time of war between Judah and Israel. This occurred when Ahaz was facing military threats from both Israel and Syria, and had turned away from fully following the Lord.
