Kenath was a city located in the region of Gilead, east of the Jordan River. During the time of Moses, the city was captured by Nobah, a descendant of Manasseh, who renamed it after himself \([[Num.32.42|Numbers 32:42]]\). The city was also known as Nophah \([[Num.21.30|Numbers 21:30]]\). In the time of Gideon, Kenath was mentioned as being near Jogbehah, where Gideon pursued and defeated the Midianite kings Zebah and Zalmunna \([[Judg.8.11|Judges 8:11]]\). Later, according to [[1Chr.2.23|1 Chronicles 2:23]], Geshur and Aram captured Kenath and its villages, totaling sixty towns. This suggests that the city and its surrounding area were of significant size and importance. The exact location of Kenath is uncertain, but it is believed to be in the modern-day Hauran region of Syria, possibly at the site of Qanawat, which preserves the ancient name.
