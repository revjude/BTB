Mikneiah is mentioned in the book of 1 Chronicles as a Levite musician who served during the reign of King David \([[1Chr.15.18|1Ch.15.18]],21\). When David prepared to bring the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem, he appointed Levites to carry the ark and musicians to accompany the procession with various instruments. Mikneiah was one of the Levites chosen to play the harp \([[1Chr.15.18|1Ch.15.18]]\). He is specifically mentioned as one of the musicians who played the harp "to lead" \([[1Chr.15.21|1Ch.15.21]]\), suggesting that he had a leadership role or was skilled in his musical abilities. No further details about Mikneiah's life, family, or other responsibilities as a Levite are provided in the biblical text. His mention serves to document the importance of music in worship and the individuals who were appointed to serve in this capacity during David's reign.
