Shaul, mentioned in [[Gen.46.10|Genesis 46:10]], [[Exod.6.15|Exodus 6:15]], [[Num.26.13|Numbers 26:13]], and [[1Chr.4.24|1 Chronicles 4:24]], was a son of Simeon and a grandson of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\). He is listed among the descendants of Jacob who went down to Egypt during the time of Joseph. Shaul is specifically identified as the son of a Canaanite woman, which sets him apart from his brothers. This detail suggests that Simeon had married a Canaanite woman, and Shaul was born from this union. In the census of the Israelites recorded in Numbers 26, Shaul is mentioned as the ancestor of the Shaulite clan within the tribe of Simeon. The inclusion of Shaul in these genealogical records highlights the importance of tracing lineage and the recognition of all descendants, even those born to foreign mothers, as part of the Israelite community. The text does not provide any further details about Shaul's life or his role within the tribe of Simeon.
