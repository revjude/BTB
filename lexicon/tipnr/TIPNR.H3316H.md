- A Judge living before Israel's Monarchy, first mentioned at Jdg.11.1; 
- referred to as Jephthah **<big>[[H3316|יִפְתָּח]]</big>**, or Jephthah \(KJV= Jephthae\)  **<big>[[G2422|Ἰεφθάε]]</big>**; 
- a son of Gilead **<big>[[H1568|גִּלְעָד]]</big>**.

Jephthah was a judge of Israel during the period between the conquest of Canaan and the establishment of the monarchy. He was the son of Gilead and a prostitute, and his half-brothers drove him away from the family inheritance. Jephthah fled to the land of Tob, where he gathered a group of warriors around him. When the Ammonites attacked Israel, the elders of Gilead asked Jephthah to lead them in battle, promising him leadership if he succeeded. Jephthah made a vow to God, pledging to sacrifice the first thing that came out of his house to meet him if he were victorious. Jephthah defeated the Ammonites, but tragically, his daughter was the first to greet him upon his return. Jephthah fulfilled his vow, and his daughter willingly submitted to her fate. Jephthah judged Israel for six years before his death. His story highlights the importance of making wise vows and the consequences of rash decisions. Despite his tragic vow, Jephthah is commended in the New Testament for his faith and is listed among the heroes of faith in Hebrews 11.
