The Tower of the Ovens, also known as the Tower of the Furnaces, is mentioned twice in the book of Nehemiah in the context of rebuilding Jerusalem's walls. In [[Neh.3.11|Nehemiah 3:11]], it is recorded that Malchijah, the son of Harim, and Hasshub, the son of Pahath-Moab, repaired another section of the wall, including the Tower of the Ovens. The tower is mentioned again in [[Neh.12.38|Nehemiah 12:38]], where it is listed among the landmarks along the route of the dedication procession for the newly rebuilt walls. The exact location of the Tower of the Ovens is not specified, but it was likely situated on the western side of Jerusalem, possibly near the Valley Gate. The name "Tower of the Ovens" suggests that the tower may have been associated with baking or cooking facilities, perhaps serving as a place where the temple bread was prepared or where the city's inhabitants baked their bread.
