<small>*A large stone in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.*</small>

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Abel</span>, a large stone in Joshua's field at Beth-shemesh, where the Ark stopped.
- A location only mentioned at [[1Sam.6.18|1Sa.6.18]]; 
- only referred to as Abel **<big>[[H0059|אָבֵל]]</big>**.

First Samuel 6:18 mentions a large stone called Abel in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh. The Ark of the Covenant was returned by the Philistines on a cart pulled by two cows. The cows stopped beside this large stone in Joshua's field. The Levites then took down the Ark and placed the Philistines' guilt offering next to the stone. The people of Beth-shemesh offered sacrifices there that day. Abel served as a memorial marker for this event.
