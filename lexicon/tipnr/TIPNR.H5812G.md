Azaziah is mentioned in [[1Chr.15.21|1 Chronicles 15:21]] as one of the Levite musicians who played the harp during the reign of King David. He was part of the group of Levites appointed by David to lead the musical worship when the Ark of the Covenant was brought to Jerusalem. The chapter describes the careful preparations and the joyous celebration that accompanied this significant event. Azaziah, along with other skilled musicians, played the harp "according to Alamoth," which may refer to a high pitch or a specific musical style. The inclusion of music and singing was an essential aspect of Israelite worship, and the Levites were given the responsibility of leading the people in praise and thanksgiving to God. Azaziah's role as a musician highlights the importance of music in the worship practices of ancient Israel.
