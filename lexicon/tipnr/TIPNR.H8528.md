Tel-melah is mentioned in [[Ezra.2.59|Ezra 2:59]] and [[Neh.7.61|Nehemiah 7:61]] as one of the Babylonian cities from which Jewish exiles returned to Jerusalem after the decree of Cyrus the Great. Along with the exiles from Tel-harsha and Cherub-addan-immer, those from Tel-melah were unable to prove their ancestry or demonstrate that they belonged to the people of Israel. This indicates that during the Babylonian captivity, some Jews may have lost track of their genealogical records or intermarried with non-Jewish populations. The exact location of Tel-melah is unknown, but it was likely situated in Babylonia, the region where the Jewish exiles had been deported. The name "Tel-melah" may be derived from the Akkadian language, meaning "mound of salt" or "hill of salt." The mention of Tel-melah in the context of the returning exiles underscores the challenges faced by some Jews in establishing their identity and lineage after the Babylonian exile.
