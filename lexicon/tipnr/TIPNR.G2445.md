Joppa, also known as Japho in the Old Testament and modern-day Jaffa, is one of the oldest cities in the world, located on the Mediterranean coast of Israel. It is first mentioned as part of the inheritance of the tribe of Dan \([[Josh.19.46|Joshua 19:46]]\). Joppa served as the main seaport for Jerusalem, and it was here that the cedar wood from Lebanon arrived for the construction of Solomon's Temple \([[2Chr.2.16|2 Chronicles 2:16]]\) and later for the Second Temple \([[Ezra.3.7|Ezra 3:7]]\). The prophet Jonah set sail from Joppa when he tried to flee from God's command to preach in Nineveh \([[Jonah.1.3|Jonah 1:3]]\). In the New Testament, Joppa is significant as the place where Peter stayed with Simon the tanner and had a vision that led him to preach to the Gentiles \(Acts 9:36-43; 10:5-23\). It was also the home of Tabitha \(Dorcas\), whom Peter raised from the dead \(Acts 9:36-42\). Joppa has a long and rich history, and its strategic location made it an important city throughout biblical times.
