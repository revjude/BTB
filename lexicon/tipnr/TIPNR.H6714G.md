Zohar was a Hittite man who lived in the region of Hebron during the time of Abraham. He was the father of Ephron, a prominent Hittite who owned the cave of Machpelah and the surrounding field. When Abraham's wife Sarah died, he sought to purchase a burial site for her. Abraham approached the Hittites and requested to buy the cave of Machpelah from Ephron, son of Zohar. The Hittites offered to give the land to Abraham for free, but he insisted on paying the full price. Ephron agreed to sell the cave and the field for 400 shekels of silver. Abraham's purchase of this property, which became the burial site for Sarah, Abraham himself, and later the patriarchs and matriarchs, is significant as it represents the first piece of land owned by the Israelites in Canaan. Zohar's mention in this narrative highlights his role as the father of Ephron and a witness to this important transaction.
