Hebron, also known as Kiriath-arba, was an important city located in the hill country of Judah. It is first mentioned in [[Gen.13.18|Genesis 13:18]], where Abraham pitched his tent and built an altar to the Lord. It was possibly renamed Hebron by Mareshah the "father \[<i>abi</i>\] of Hebron", which narmally refers to a founder, though he also had a son named Hebron \(1Ch.2.42-43\). The city was originally named Kiriath-arba, which means "the city of Arba," who was the greatest man among the Anakim \([[Josh.14.15|Joshua 14:15]]\). 

Hebron played a significant role in the lives of the patriarchs. Sarah, Abraham's wife, died in Kiriath-arba, and Abraham purchased the cave of Machpelah as a burial site for her \([[Gen.23.2|Genesis 23:2]], 19\). Later, Abraham, Isaac, and Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) were also buried there \([[Gen.35.27|Genesis 35:27]]; 49:29-32\). 

During the conquest of Canaan, Hebron was taken by Joshua and the Israelites \([[Josh.10.3|Joshua 10:3]]6-37\). The city was given to Caleb as his inheritance \([[Josh.14.13|Joshua 14:13]]-14\), and later became a city of the Levites and a city of refuge \([[Josh.20.7|Joshua 20:7]]; 21:11-13\). 

Hebron served as the capital of Judah during the reign of David. He was anointed king over the house of Judah in Hebron and reigned there for seven and a half years \([[2Sam.2.1|2 Samuel 2:1]]-4, 11; 5:5\). Several of David's sons were born in Hebron, including Amnon, Absalom, and Adonijah \([[2Sam.3.2|2 Samuel 3:2]]-5\). 

The city remained significant throughout Israel's history. It was fortified by Rehoboam \([[2Chr.11.10|2 Chronicles 11:10]]\) and was inhabited by Jews after the Babylonian exile \([[Neh.11.25|Nehemiah 11:25]]\). 

Hebron is also notable for its association with the Anakim, a group of giants who inhabited the area \(Numbers 13:22, 33\). Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak from Hebron: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai \([[Josh.15.13|Joshua 15:13]]-14; [[Judg.1.10|Judges 1:10]], 20\). 

Today, Hebron is still an important city, known for the Tomb of the Patriarchs, which is believed to be the burial site of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The city has a rich history and holds great significance for Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike.
