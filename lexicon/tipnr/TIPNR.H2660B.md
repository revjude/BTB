Hepher was a Canaanite city mentioned in the Old Testament. It first appears in [[Josh.12.17|Joshua 12:17]] as one of the cities conquered by Joshua and the Israelites during their campaign to take possession of the Promised Land. The city was ruled by a king, who was defeated along with other Canaanite rulers. 

The exact location of Hepher is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in the northern part of Canaan, as it is listed among other cities in that region, such as Tappuah and Aphek. 

Hepher is mentioned again in [[1Kgs.4.10|1 Kings 4:10]], where it is described as part of a district under Solomon's rule. The passage lists the twelve officers who were appointed to provide food for King Solomon and his household, each responsible for a specific region. The district that included Hepher was overseen by the son of Hesed. 

The fact that Hepher was a city with its own king during the time of Joshua and later became part of a district under Solomon's rule suggests that it was a place of some significance. However, the Bible does not provide any further details about the city's history, size, or importance. 

The mention of Hepher in the biblical text serves to highlight the extent of the Israelites' conquest of Canaan under Joshua's leadership and the later organization of the kingdom under Solomon's reign. It also demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promise to give the land of Canaan to the Israelites as an inheritance.
