Jorai is listed as one of seven clan chiefs of the half-tribe of Manasseh in [[1Chr.5.13|1 Chronicles 5:13]]. These chiefs are listed in the context of the genealogies and history of the tribes living east of the Jordan River, including Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh \(1 Chronicles 5:11-26\). The text notes that these were the heads of families during the reign of King Jotham of Judah \(1 Chronicles 5:17\), which would place them in the 8th century BC. As a clan chief, Jorai would have had a leadership role among his extended family group within the half-tribe of Manasseh.
