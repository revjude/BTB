Sansannah is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the list of towns allotted to the tribe of Judah in the Negev region \(Josh. 15:31\). The Negev was the southern part of the Promised Land, known for its arid climate and sparse vegetation. The exact location of Sansannah is unknown, but it was likely situated in the southern portion of Judah's territory.
