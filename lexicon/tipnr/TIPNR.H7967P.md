Shallum, mentioned in [[Ezra.10.42|Ezra 10:42]], was one of the Israelites who had married a foreign woman during the time of Ezra. When Ezra called for a assembly to address the issue of intermarriage among the returned exiles, Shallum was among those found guilty of this transgression. As part of the solution to this problem, Shallum, along with the others who had taken foreign wives, made a covenant to put away their wives and children. This action was taken to demonstrate their commitment to following God's law and maintaining the purity of the Israelite community. The text does not provide any further information about Shallum's background, profession, or specific family situation.
