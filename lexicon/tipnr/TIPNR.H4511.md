Minnith was a town located in the land of the Ammonites, east of the Jordan River. In [[Judg.11.33|Judges 11:33]], it is mentioned as one of the places where Jephthah, a judge of Israel, defeated the Ammonites. Jephthah pursued the Ammonites from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith, striking them with a great blow. [[Ezek.27.17|Ezekiel 27:17]] also mentions Minnith as a place known for its wheat, which was traded with Tyre. This suggests that Minnith was a fertile area with a reputation for producing high-quality wheat.
