Malachi was a prophet of the Lord who delivered a message to the people of Israel after their return from Babylonian exile. The opening verse of the book bearing his name states that the word of the Lord came to Israel through Malachi. The name "Malachi" means "my messenger" in Hebrew. Malachi confronted the people about their spiritual apathy, their neglect of proper worship, and their disobedience to God's laws. He also foretold the coming of a messenger who would prepare the way for the Lord \([[Mal.1.1|Malachi 1:1]]\).
