Jehoahaz, also known as Johanan, was a king of Judah and the son of Josiah, as mentioned in [[2Kgs.23.30|2 Kings 23:30]]-31, [[2Chr.36.1|2 Chronicles 36:1]]-2, and [[1Chr.3.15|1 Chronicles 3:15]]. After the death of his father Josiah, the people of the land made Jehoahaz king in Jerusalem, even though he was not the eldest son \([[2Kgs.23.30|2 Kings 23:30]], [[2Chr.36.1|2 Chronicles 36:1]]\). He was twenty-three years old when he became king and reigned for only three months \([[2Kgs.23.31|2 Kings 23:31]], [[2Chr.36.2|2 Chronicles 36:2]]\). However, Pharaoh Necho of Egypt removed Jehoahaz from the throne, imposed a heavy tribute on Judah, and made his brother Eliakim \(later renamed Jehoiakim\) king in his place \(2 Kings 23:33-34, 2 Chronicles 36:3-4\). Pharaoh Necho took Jehoahaz captive to Egypt, where he died \([[2Kgs.23.34|2 Kings 23:34]]\). The brief reign of Jehoahaz was marked by the increasing influence of Egypt over Judah and the beginning of a period of political instability and foreign domination.
