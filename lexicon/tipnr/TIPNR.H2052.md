Waheb is a place name that appears only once in the Bible, in [[Num.21.14|Numbers 21:14]], in the context of Israel's journey through the wilderness. The verse is part of a quotation from the "Book of the Wars of the Lord," an ancient source that is no longer extant. The passage reads, "Waheb in Suphah, and the valleys of the Arnon." The exact location of Waheb is unknown, but it is mentioned alongside the valleys of the Arnon, suggesting that it may have been situated in the region of Moab, east of the Dead Sea. Some scholars propose that "Waheb" may not be a place name but rather a verb meaning "to give" or "to destroy." However, the lack of additional context makes it difficult to determine the precise meaning of the term. The reference to Waheb in the Book of Numbers provides a glimpse into the geographical and historical details of Israel's wilderness journey, even though the exact nature of the place remains uncertain.
