Ashteroth-karnaim, also called Karnaim, was an ancient city located east of the Jordan River in the region of Bashan. It is first mentioned in the Bible as one of the cities defeated by Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and his allies during the time of Abraham \([[Gen.14.5|Genesis 14:5]]\). The name Ashteroth-karnaim likely means "Ashteroth of the two horns," possibly referring to the goddess Astarte who was depicted with horns. The city was later part of the territory allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh \(Joshua 13:29-31\). The prophet Amos denounced the city, possibly indicating that it had become a center of idolatry \(Amos 6:13\).
