Man living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Medad</span>, along with Eldad, prophesied in the Israelite camp, though they had not gone to the tent of meeting \([[Num.11.26|Num.11.26]],27\).
- A man living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Num.11.26|Num.11.26]]; 
- only referred to as Medad<[[H4312]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>מ</span>ֵ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יד</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>\).

Medad was an Israelite who, along with Eldad, received the Spirit and prophesied in the camp during the time of Moses. When Moses appointed seventy elders to assist him in leading the people, the Lord took some of the Spirit that was on Moses and put it on the seventy elders. However, Eldad and Medad, who were listed among the elders but had not gone to the tent of meeting, began prophesying in the camp. When Joshua urged Moses to stop them, Moses responded, "Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the Lord's people were prophets and that the Lord would put his Spirit on them!" \([[Num.11.26|Numbers 11:26]]-29\). This event demonstrates that the Spirit of God can work through individuals unexpectedly and that God's power is not limited to human structures or expectations.
