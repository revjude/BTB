Lehi is mentioned in the book of Judges as a place where Samson, empowered by the Spirit of God, fought against the Philistines. The Philistines went up and encamped in Judah, spreading out in Lehi \([[Judg.15.9|Judges 15:9]]\). When Samson was handed over to the Philistines by the men of Judah, he broke free from his bonds and struck down a thousand Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey \([[Judg.15.14|Judges 15:14]]-15\). After this victory, Samson was thirsty, and God miraculously provided water for him to drink from a hollow place in Lehi \([[Judg.15.19|Judges 15:19]]\). The name "Lehi" is also mentioned in [[2Sam.23.11|2 Samuel 23:11]] as the location of a battle where Shammah, one of David's mighty men, stood his ground against the Philistines and achieved a great victory.
