Shemaiah was a Levite who lived during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. He is mentioned in [[2Chr.29.14|2 Chronicles 29:14]] as one of the sons of Heman, a prominent Levitical musician. When Hezekiah initiated a cleansing and rededication of the temple, Shemaiah was among the Levites who gathered to participate in the process. The Levites were tasked with removing all the uncleanness from the temple and restoring it to its proper state for worship. Although Shemaiah's specific role in the cleansing is not detailed, his participation demonstrates the involvement of the Levites in the restoration of temple worship under Hezekiah's leadership.
