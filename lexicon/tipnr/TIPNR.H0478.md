Elishaphat is mentioned as one of the captains who assisted Jehoiada the priest in overthrowing Queen Athaliah and installing Joash as the rightful king of Judah \([[2Chr.23.1|2Ch.23.1]]\). After the death of King Ahaziah, Athaliah seized power and ruled over Judah for six years. In the seventh year, Jehoiada the priest organized a coup to remove Athaliah and restore the Davidic line to the throne. Elishaphat, along with other captains and Levites, gathered the people and supported Jehoiada in his plan. They crowned Joash as king and executed Athaliah, effectively ending her reign. The Bible does not provide any additional information about Elishaphat's background, life, or role beyond his involvement in this significant event in Judah's history.
