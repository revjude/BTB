Jezreel is mentioned in [[2Sam.4.4|2 Samuel 4:4]] as a son of Jonathan, the son of King Saul. He is described as being five years old when Saul and Jonathan died in battle against the Philistines at Mount Gilboa. Upon hearing the news of their deaths, Jezreel's nurse picked him up and fled, but in her haste, Jezreel fell and became lame. Later in the narrative, he is referred to as Merib-baal \(also known as Mephibosheth\), and David shows kindness to him for the sake of his father Jonathan \(2 Samuel 9\).
