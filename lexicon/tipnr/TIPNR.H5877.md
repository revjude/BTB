En-hazor is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Josh.19.37|Joshua 19:37]], as one of the cities allotted to the tribe of Naphtali during the division of the Promised Land. It is listed among other cities in Naphtali's territory, such as Kedesh, Edrei, and Yiron. 

The name En-hazor means "spring of Hazor" or "fountain of the village," suggesting the presence of a water source near a settlement called Hazor. This Hazor is likely not the same as the major Canaanite city of Hazor, which was located in the northern part of Israel and was conquered by Joshua \(Joshua 11:1-14\). 

No other details about En-hazor are provided in the Bible, and its exact location is unknown. It was likely situated within the boundaries of Naphtali's territory, which was located in the northernmost part of Israel, in the region of Galilee.
