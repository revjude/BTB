Saul was the first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel in response to the people's request for a king \(1 Samuel 8-10\). He was a tall and handsome Benjamite who initially showed humility and potential as a leader \([[1Sam.9.2|1 Samuel 9:2]], 21; 10:6-7, 9-10\). However, Saul's reign was marked by disobedience and rebellion against God. He offered an unlawful sacrifice before a battle against the Philistines \(1 Samuel 13:8-14\) and later disobeyed God's command to completely destroy the Amalekites and their possessions \(1 Samuel 15\). As a result, God rejected Saul as king and chose David to replace him \(1 Samuel 15:23, 28; 16:1, 13\). Saul became jealous of David's success and popularity, leading him to pursue David and attempt to kill him on multiple occasions \(1 Samuel 18-26\). Saul also massacred the priests of Nob for assisting David \(1 Samuel 22:6-23\). In a battle against the Philistines, Saul was critically wounded and took his own life to avoid capture \(1 Samuel 31:1-6\). His body was later recovered by the men of Jabesh-gilead and buried \([[1Sam.31.11|1 Samuel 31:11]]-13\). Despite his tragic end, Saul's reign united the tribes of Israel and laid the foundation for the Israelite monarchy. His life serves as a warning against disobedience and the consequences of turning away from God.
