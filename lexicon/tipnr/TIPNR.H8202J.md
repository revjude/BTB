Shaphat, mentioned in [[1Chr.5.12|1 Chronicles 5:12]], was a leader of the Gadites who lived in the region of Bashan. He is described as the second in rank among the Gadites during the reign of Jotham, king of Judah. The Gadites were one of the Israelite tribes that settled on the east side of the Jordan River, and Bashan was a fertile area known for its lush pastures and well-fed livestock. Shaphat's position as a leader suggests that he held a significant role in the governance and organization of the Gadites in Bashan. The text does not provide any specific details about Shaphat's actions or achievements as a leader. However, his mention in the context of the genealogical records of the Gadites highlights the importance of tribal leadership and the role of the Gadites in the history of Israel.
