The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Hararites</span> were a group from which some of David's mighty men came, including Shammah and Ahiam.
- People from Harar or Harod \(cf. [[2Sam.23.11|2Sa.23.11]], 25\), first mentioned at [[2Sam.23.11|2Sa.23.11]]; 
- referred to as Hararites **<big>[[H2043|הֲרָרִי]]</big>**, or Hararite **<big>[[H2043|הֲרָרִי]]</big>**.

The Hararites are mentioned in [[2Sam.23.11|2 Samuel 23:11]], 33, and [[1Chr.11.34|1 Chronicles 11:34]], 35 in the context of David's mighty men. These were a group of elite warriors who fought alongside King David and were renowned for their bravery and military prowess. Two of David's mighty men, Shammah the son of Agee and Ahiam the son of Sharar, are specifically identified as Hararites. Shammah is noted for his stand against the Philistines in a field of lentils, where he defended the ground and struck down the Philistines, bringing about a great victory \([[2Sam.23.11|2 Samuel 23:11]]-12\). The exact location or origin of the Hararites is not specified in the Bible, but they were likely a clan or a region from which these warriors came. The mention of the Hararites in the lists of David's mighty men highlights the diversity of the group and the fact that David's support came from various parts of Israel.
