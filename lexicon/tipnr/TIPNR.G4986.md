- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[John.10.23|Act.20.4]]; 
- referred to as Sopater **<big>[[G4986|Σώπατρος]]</big>**, or Sosipater **<big>[[G4989|Σωσίπατρος]]</big>**; 
- a son of Pyrrhus **<big>[[G6077|Πύρρος]]</big>**.

Sopater, also known as Sosipater, was a Christian mentioned in the New Testament as a companion of the apostle Paul. He is first mentioned in Acts 20:4 as a Berean who accompanied Paul on his journey from Greece to Jerusalem, along with several others, including Aristarchus, Secundus, Gaius, Timothy, Tychicus, and Trophimus. This journey took place during Paul's third missionary journey, as he was returning to Jerusalem with an offering for the believers there \(Acts 24:17\). 

Sopater's inclusion in this group suggests that he was a trusted member of the early Christian community and a close associate of Paul. As a Berean, he likely came from the city of Berea \(modern-day Veria\) in Macedonia, where Paul had previously preached the gospel and found the people to be open-minded and receptive to his message \(Acts 17:10-12\). 

Later, in [[Rom.16.21|Romans 16:21]], a Sosipater is mentioned among those sending greetings to the church in Rome, along with Timothy, Lucius, Jason, and others. While it is not explicitly stated, it is likely that this Sosipater is the same person as Sopater from Berea, as both names were used interchangeably in ancient times. 

The mention of Sopater/Sosipater in these two passages highlights the close-knit nature of the early Christian community and the importance of personal relationships in the spread of the gospel. As a companion of Paul and a member of the delegation carrying the offering to Jerusalem, Sopater played a role in the practical support and unity of the church.
