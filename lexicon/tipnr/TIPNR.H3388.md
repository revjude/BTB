Jerusha's son Jotham became king at the age of 25 and reigned for 16 years in Jerusalem. He is described as a righteous king who did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, following the example of his father Uzziah. The mention of Jerusha in the biblical record highlights the importance of maternal lineage in the royal families of Judah and the role of queen mothers in the life of their sons.
