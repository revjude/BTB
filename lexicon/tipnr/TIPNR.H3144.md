- A man from the tribe of Simeon\(?\) living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.4.34|1Ch.4.34]]; 
- only referred to as Joshah **<big>[[H3144|יוֹשָׁה]]</big>**; 
- a son of Amaziah **<big>[[H0558|אֲמַצְיָה]]</big>**.

Joshah is mentioned in [[1Chr.4.34|1 Chronicles 4:34]] as one of the leaders from the tribe of Simeon during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. The context of the passage is the genealogy and history of the tribe of Simeon \(1 Chronicles 4:24-43\). During Hezekiah's reign, some Simeonites, including Joshah, migrated to the region of Gedor in search of pasture for their flocks \(1 Chronicles 4:39\). They also attacked and displaced the Hamites and Meunites who were living there \(1 Chronicles 4:40-41\). These events likely took place in the late 8th century BC, during the religious and political reforms of King Hezekiah \(2 Chronicles 29-32\).
