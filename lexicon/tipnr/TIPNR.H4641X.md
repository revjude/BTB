Maaseiah was a priest who served during the reigns of Kings Zedekiah and Jehoiakim of Judah \([[Jer.21.1|Jer.21.1]]; 29.25; 37.3\). He was the father of Zephaniah, who was also a priest \([[Jer.21.1|Jer.21.1]]; 29.25; 37.3\). During the reign of Zedekiah, Maaseiah and his son Zephaniah were sent by the king to inquire of the prophet Jeremiah concerning the Babylonian invasion \([[Jer.21.1|Jer.21.1]]; 37.3\). Maaseiah is also mentioned in a letter sent by Jeremiah to the exiles in Babylon, where he is referred to as the second priest under Jehoiada, the high priest \([[Jer.29.25|Jer.29.25]]\). This suggests that Maaseiah held a significant position within the priestly hierarchy. The biblical text does not provide further details about Maaseiah's personal life or his other priestly duties.
