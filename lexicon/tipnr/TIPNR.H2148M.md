Zechariah was a Levite of the sons of Asaph who lived during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. When Hezekiah began to restore and cleanse the temple, Zechariah was among the Levites who gathered to help. The Levites took all the unclean things from the inner part of the temple and brought them out to be disposed of. They sanctified the temple and the altar, preparing to restart the service of the Lord that had been neglected under the previous kings.
