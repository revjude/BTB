- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.12.6|1Ch.12.6]]; 
- only referred to as Jashobeam **<big>[[H3434|יָשׇׁבְעָם]]</big>**.

Jashobeam is mentioned in [[1Chr.12.6|1 Chronicles 12:6]] as one of the Korahites who joined David at Ziklag when he was fleeing from King Saul. The Korahites were a Levitical family known for their role in the music and worship of the tabernacle and temple. During David's time of exile, many skilled warriors from various tribes came to support him, recognizing him as the rightful king of Israel. Jashobeam, along with other Korahites, was among these supporters. The text describes them as brave warriors, trained for battle and able to handle the shield and spear. Their presence at Ziklag demonstrates their loyalty to David and their willingness to stand with him during a difficult time. This Jashobeam is likely a different person from the mighty man of the same name mentioned in other passages, as the context and tribal affiliation differ.
