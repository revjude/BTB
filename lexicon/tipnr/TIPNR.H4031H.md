Magog is mentioned in the prophetic books of Ezekiel and Revelation as a nation that will play a significant role in the end times. In Ezekiel 38-39, Magog is described as a land ruled by Gog, a prince who will lead a coalition of nations to attack Israel. God will intervene and defeat Gog and Magog, demonstrating His power and sovereignty \(Ezekiel 38:18-23; 39:1-7\). In [[Rev.20.8|Revelation 20:8]], Magog is mentioned alongside Gog as nations that will be deceived by Satan after the millennium and will gather for battle against God's people, only to be destroyed by fire from heaven. The exact identity and location of Magog are not specified in the Bible, but it is often associated with regions north of Israel.
