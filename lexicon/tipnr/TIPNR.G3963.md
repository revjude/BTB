Patmos is a small Greek island located in the Aegean Sea, approximately 37 miles southwest of Miletus. It is mentioned in the New Testament in [[Rev.1.9|Revelation 1:9]], where the apostle John states that he was on the island of Patmos "because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus." According to early Christian tradition, John was exiled to Patmos during the reign of the Roman emperor Domitian \(AD 81-96\) because of his faith and preaching. While on Patmos, John received a series of visions from God, which he recorded in the Book of Revelation. These visions include messages to the seven churches of Asia Minor, prophetic imagery, and a glimpse of the heavenly throne room. The island of Patmos has since become a place of pilgrimage for Christians, with several monasteries and churches commemorating John's exile and the writing of Revelation.
