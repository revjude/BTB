Zadok is mentioned as a high priest who lived and served in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. He is listed in the genealogies of the priests in the books of Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah. Zadok was a descendant of the earlier high priest Zadok who served during the reigns of David and Solomon. In the postexilic period, Zadok is described as the son of Meraioth and the father of Meshullam. He was part of the priestly lineage that returned to Jerusalem to help rebuild the temple and reestablish the worship of God. The mention of Zadok in these genealogies emphasizes the continuity of the priestly line and the importance of the priesthood in the restoration of Jewish religious life after the exile.
