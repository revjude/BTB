Hamor was a Hivite who founded the city of Shechem during the time of the patriarchs. His son was called Shechem, after whom the city was named \([[Gen.33.19|Genesis 33:19]]\). When Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and his family settled near Shechem, Hamor's son Shechem assaulted Jacob's daughter Dinah \([[Gen.34.2|Genesis 34:2]]\). Hamor and Shechem sought to arrange a marriage between Shechem and Dinah and proposed that their people intermarry with Jacob's family \([[Gen.34.8|Genesis 34:8]]-10\). Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, deceitfully agreed on the condition that all the men of Shechem be circumcised \([[Gen.34.13|Genesis 34:13]]-24\). However, while the men of Shechem were recovering from the circumcision, Simeon and Levi attacked the city, killed Hamor and Shechem, and rescued Dinah \([[Gen.34.2|Genesis 34:2]]5-29\). The land that Jacob had purchased from Hamor became a possession of the Israelites and was later allocated to the tribe of Manasseh \([[Josh.24.32|Joshua 24:32]]\). In the time of the judges, Gaal son of Ebed challenged Abimelech's rule in Shechem, invoking the memory of Hamor as the city's ancestral leader \([[Judg.9.28|Judges 9:28]]\). In Acts 7:16, Stephen mentions that Abraham bought a tomb from the sons of Hamor in Shechem, which may refer to the same transaction or a separate one.
