Wildgoats Rocks is a location mentioned in [[1Sam.24.2|1 Samuel 24:2]] as a place where David and his men sought refuge while fleeing from King Saul. The area is described as being near En Gedi, a lush oasis on the western shore of the Dead Sea. Saul, having returned from pursuing the Philistines, took 3,000 chosen men to search for David and his men in the Wildgoats Rocks region. While Saul was in a cave relieving himself, David had the opportunity to cut off a corner of the king's robe, demonstrating his loyalty and respect for Saul as the Lord's anointed. The rugged terrain of Wildgoats Rocks provided numerous hiding places for David and his men, making it difficult for Saul to locate them. The name "Wildgoats Rocks" likely refers to the rugged, steep cliffs in the area, which are suitable habitats for wild goats. This incident in the Wildgoats Rocks demonstrates David's integrity and faith in God's plan for his life, as he refused to harm Saul, even when presented with the opportunity.
