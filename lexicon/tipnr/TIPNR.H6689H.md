Zuph is mentioned in the Bible as a land or region in the hill country of Ephraim \([[1Sam.9.5|1Sa.9.5]]\). It was named after Zuph, an Ephraimite, who was an ancestor of Samuel \(1Ch.6:35\). When Saul and his servant were searching for his father's lost donkeys, they passed through the land of Zuph. As they were about to return home, Saul's servant suggested that they consult the prophet Samuel, who was in a nearby city, for guidance \(1Sa.9:6\). This led to Saul's anointing as the first king of Israel by Samuel. The exact location and extent of the land of Zuph are not specified, but it was likely in the general vicinity of Samuel's hometown, Ramah, in the hill country of Ephraim.
