- A man living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Sam.19.37|2Sa.19.37]]; 
- only referred to as Chimham<[[H3643]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>כ</span>ִּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>מ</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ם</span>\).

Chimham was the son of Barzillai the Gileadite, who was a wealthy man from Rogelim. During Absalom's rebellion against King David, Barzillai provided support for David and his followers when they fled from Jerusalem \(2 Samuel 17:27-29\). After Absalom's defeat, when David returned to Jerusalem, Barzillai accompanied him to the Jordan River. Due to his advanced age, Barzillai declined David's invitation to come with him to Jerusalem. Instead, he sent his son Chimham to go with the king \([[2Sam.19.37|2 Samuel 19:37]]-38\). David showed kindness to Chimham and promised to do for him whatever Barzillai requested \([[2Sam.19.38|2 Samuel 19:38]]\). Chimham then went on with David to Jerusalem \([[2Sam.19.40|2 Samuel 19:40]]\). This act of loyalty and the king's favor suggests that Chimham held a special place in David's court.
