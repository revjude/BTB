Zoan was an ancient city of Egypt, mentioned in several contexts in the Bible. It was one of the cities built by the Israelites during their enslavement in Egypt \([[Num.13.22|Num.13.22]]\). The fields of Zoan were the site of God's miracles and mighty acts during the time of Moses \(Ps.78:12,43\). The princes of Zoan are described as fools, unable to give wise counsel to Pharaoh \([[Isa.19.11|Isa.19.11]],13\). Zoan is also mentioned as a place where the rebellious Israelites sent messengers, seeking help from Egypt rather than trusting in God \([[Isa.30.4|Isa.30.4]]\). Ezekiel prophesied that Zoan would be in terror and face God's judgment \([[Ezek.30.14|Ezk.30.14]]\). Zoan is most likely to be identified with Tanis, an important city in the Nile Delta region of ancient Egypt. It served as a capital during the 21st and 22nd dynasties.
