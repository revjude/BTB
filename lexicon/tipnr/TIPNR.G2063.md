The Red Sea is significant in the Bible as the sea the Israelites miraculously crossed during the Exodus from Egypt. God parted the waters, allowing Israel to cross on dry ground, but drowned the pursuing Egyptian army when the waters closed back over them \(Exo. 14-15\). This event is remembered as a great act of divine deliverance \(Jos. 2:10; Neh. 9:9; Psa. 106:7-9; 136:13-15\). The Red Sea also marked the southern border of the Promised Land \(Exo. 23:31\). King Solomon later built a fleet of ships on the Red Sea at Ezion-geber \(1 Ki. 9:26\). The Hebrew name Yam Suph means "Sea of Reeds", so the body of water was likely one of the shallow lakes along Egypt's eastern border rather than the main body of the Red Sea. Its exact location is debated.
