Hosah was a Levite who served as a gatekeeper during the reign of King David. He is mentioned in the book of 1 Chronicles. 

In [[1Chr.16.38|1 Chronicles 16:38]], Hosah is listed among the Levites appointed by David to minister before the Ark of the Covenant at the tabernacle in Jerusalem. He served alongside Obed-Edom and his sixty-eight associates. 

Hosah is also mentioned in 1 Chronicles 26, which provides more details about the organization of the gatekeepers. In verse 10, it is stated that Hosah, from the Merarite clan, had sons who were also gatekeepers. His firstborn son was Shimri, who was made the chief by his father, even though he was not the firstborn \([[1Chr.26.11|1 Chronicles 26:11]]\). 

According to [[1Chr.26.16|1 Chronicles 26:16]], Hosah and his sons were assigned to guard the West Gate and the Shalleketh Gate on the ascending highway. This suggests that they had specific responsibilities in maintaining the security and order of the tabernacle complex. 

The role of the gatekeepers was crucial in ensuring the sanctity and proper functioning of the tabernacle. They were responsible for guarding the entrances, regulating access, and maintaining order. Hosah's inclusion in the list of gatekeepers highlights the importance of this role and the dedication of the Levites in serving God and His people.
