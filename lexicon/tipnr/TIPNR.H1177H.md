- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.27.28|1Ch.27.28]]; 
- only referred to as Baal-hanan<[[H1177H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>ַּ֫<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span> <span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ח</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ן</span>\).

Baal-hanan the Gederite was one of the officials who served under King David. In [[1Chr.27.28|1 Chronicles 27:28]], he is described as being in charge of the olive and sycamore trees in the lowlands, which were likely the coastal plains and foothills of Judah. This was an important role, as olive oil and sycamore fruit were valuable crops in ancient Israel. Baal-hanan's title "the Gederite" suggests he was from the town of Geder or had an association with that place.
