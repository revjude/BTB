- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.8.8|Ezr.8.8]]; 
- only referred to as Zebadiah **<big>[[H2069|זְבַדְיָה]]</big>**;

Zebadiah, the son of Michael, was one of the leaders who accompanied Ezra on his journey from Babylon to Jerusalem after the exile. He led a group of 80 men from the descendants of Shephatiah. The text records that Ezra gathered these leaders and their families at the river that flows to Ahava, where they camped for three days before setting out for Jerusalem. Ezra had called for a fast to seek God's protection for their journey. The inclusion of Zebadiah in this list suggests he was a respected leader among the returning exiles.
