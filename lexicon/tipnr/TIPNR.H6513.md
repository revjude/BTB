- A man living before Israel's Monarchy, first mentioned at [[Judg.7.10|Jdg.7.10]]; 
- only referred to as Purah **<big>[[H6513|פֻּרָה]]</big>**.

Purah was the servant of Gideon, a judge of Israel. He is mentioned in the context of Gideon's campaign against the Midianites \([[Judg.7.10|Judges 7:10]]-11\). Before the battle, God instructed Gideon to go down to the Midianite camp with his servant Purah to hear what they were saying. Gideon obeyed, and he and Purah went to the outskirts of the camp. There, they heard a man telling his companion about a dream he had, which Gideon interpreted as a sign that God would give the Midianites into his hands. This event strengthened Gideon's faith and encouraged him to proceed with his plan to defeat the Midianites with a small army of 300 men.
