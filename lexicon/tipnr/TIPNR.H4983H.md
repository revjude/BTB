Mattaniah was one of the sons of Heman, a prominent musician in King David's court. Heman, along with Asaph and Jeduthun, was appointed by David to lead the music and praise in the tabernacle \(1 Chronicles 25:1\). Mattaniah, along with his brothers, was chosen by lot to serve as a musician and singer in the temple. He was the ninth son of Heman and was responsible for the ninth division of musicians \([[1Chr.25.4|1 Chronicles 25:4]], 16\). The presence of Mattaniah and his brothers in the temple music ministry highlights the importance of worship and the role of skilled musicians in ancient Israelite culture.
