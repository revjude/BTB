Sanballat was the governor of Samaria during the time of Nehemiah, who led the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem \([[Neh.2.10|Nehemiah 2:10]], 19\). When Sanballat heard that Nehemiah had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel, he was deeply disturbed \([[Neh.2.10|Nehemiah 2:10]]\). Along with Tobiah the Ammonite and Geshem the Arab, Sanballat mocked and ridiculed the Jews' efforts to rebuild the wall \([[Neh.2.19|Nehemiah 2:19]]; 4:1-3\). When the wall was being built, Sanballat became furious and plotted with others to attack Jerusalem and create confusion \([[Neh.4.7|Nehemiah 4:7]]-8\). Despite these threats, Nehemiah and the people continued to work on the wall, setting up guards to protect against potential attacks \(Nehemiah 4:9-23\). Sanballat, along with Tobiah and Geshem, tried to lure Nehemiah away from the city to harm him, but Nehemiah refused to meet with them \([[Neh.6.1|Nehemiah 6:1]]-4\). They also accused Nehemiah of rebelling against the king of Persia, but Nehemiah denied these allegations \([[Neh.6.5|Nehemiah 6:5]]-9\). Later, Nehemiah discovered that one of the priests, Eliashib, had allied himself with Tobiah and prepared a room for him in the courts of the house of God \(Nehemiah 13:4-7\). Nehemiah also learned that one of Eliashib's grandsons had married Sanballat's daughter, and he drove him away \([[Neh.13.28|Nehemiah 13:28]]\). Throughout the book of Nehemiah, Sanballat is portrayed as a persistent enemy who sought to hinder the rebuilding of Jerusalem and undermine Nehemiah's leadership.
