Pethahiah was a Levite who participated in leading the people in confession and worship during the time of Nehemiah, according to [[Neh.9.5|Nehemiah 9:5]]. After the completion of the wall of Jerusalem, the Israelites gathered to confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors. Pethahiah, along with several other Levites, was involved in this ceremony, calling the people to stand and bless the Lord. This event highlights the role of the Levites in guiding the spiritual life of the community and the importance of confession and repentance in the post-exilic period.
