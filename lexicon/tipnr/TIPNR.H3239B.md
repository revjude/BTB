Janoah was a town located on the northern border of the territory allocated to the tribe of Ephraim \([[Josh.16.6|Joshua 16:6]],7\). It was situated near Ataroth and Naarah, in the central region of Canaan. The border of Ephraim's territory went from Janoah eastward to Taanath-shiloh and continued to the east of Janoah. This Janoah is distinct from the Janoah mentioned in 2 Kings 15:29, which was located in the northern kingdom of Israel. Its exact location remains uncertain.
