Jattir was a town located in the hill country of Judah \([[Josh.15.48|Joshua 15:48]]\). It was later designated as a Levitical city and given to the descendants of Aaron \([[Josh.21.14|Joshua 21:14]]; [[1Chr.6.57|1 Chronicles 6:57]]\). During David's reign, when he was distributing the spoils from his victory over the Amalekites, Jattir was one of the towns that received a share \([[1Sam.30.27|1 Samuel 30:27]]\). This suggests that Jattir had been loyal to David and supported him during his time of need. The exact location of Jattir is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the southern part of Judah.
