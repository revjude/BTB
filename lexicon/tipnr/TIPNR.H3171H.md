Jehiel, also referred to as Jahath, is mentioned in several passages in 1 Chronicles as a Levite leader during the reign of King David. In [[1Chr.23.8|1 Chronicles 23:8]], Jehiel is listed as one of the sons of Ladan, who was a descendant of Gershon. This chapter describes the organization of the Levites and their duties in the temple service. In [[1Chr.29.8|1 Chronicles 29:8]], Jehiel is mentioned as one of the leaders of the Levites who received the donations of precious stones for the construction of the temple. This suggests that he held a position of responsibility and trust within the Levitical community. In [[1Chr.26.21|1 Chronicles 26:21]]-22, Jehiel is identified as the father of Zetham and Joel, who were in charge of the treasuries of the house of the Lord. This passage also refers to him as Jehieli, possibly indicating a variant spelling of his name. The text does not provide any further details about Jehiel's life or his specific role as a Levite leader. However, his repeated mention in these passages highlights his importance and the significance of the Levites in the administration and service of the temple during David's reign.
