Tubal is mentioned in [[Gen.10.2|Genesis 10:2]] and [[1Chr.1.5|1 Chronicles 1:5]] as one of the sons of Japheth and grandsons of Noah. He is listed in the Table of Nations, which records the descendants of Noah's sons after the flood. The descendants of Japheth are generally associated with the peoples of Europe and Asia Minor. Some ancient historians and Jewish traditions have attempted to identify Tubal with various regions or ethnic groups, such as the Tabali or the Iberians, but these connections remain speculative. The mention of Tubal in the genealogy serves to emphasize the diversity and spread of the nations descended from Noah.
