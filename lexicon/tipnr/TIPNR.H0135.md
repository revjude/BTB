Addan, also known as Addon, is mentioned in [[Ezra.2.59|Ezra 2:59]] and [[Neh.7.61|Nehemiah 7:61]] as one of the places from which certain Jewish families returned to Judah following the Babylonian exile. These families, including the descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda, were unable to prove their Israelite ancestry or priestly lineage and were therefore excluded from the priesthood. The exact location of Addan is unknown, but it was likely a town or region in Babylonia where these exiled families had settled. The mention of Addan in the lists of returning exiles highlights the challenges faced by some Jews in establishing their identity and place within the post-exilic community.
