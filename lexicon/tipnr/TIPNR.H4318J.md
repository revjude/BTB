Micah is mentioned in the book of 1 Chronicles as a Levite who served during the reign of King David \([[1Chr.23.20|1Ch.23.20]]; 24.24,25\). He was the son of Uzziel, who was a descendant of Kohath, one of the three main branches of the Levites. In the organization of the Levites for temple service, Micah is listed as the head of his father's household \(1Ch.24.24\). His son, Shamir, is also mentioned in the genealogy \(1Ch.24.24\). The Levites were responsible for assisting the priests in the tabernacle and later in the temple. They were also in charge of music, gatekeeping, and other duties related to the worship of God. Although no specific details are given about Micah's role or contributions, his inclusion in these lists suggests that he held a position of responsibility among the Levites during David's reign.
