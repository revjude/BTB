Baara is briefly mentioned in [[1Chr.8.8|1 Chronicles 8:8]] as one of the wives of Shaharaim, a descendant of Benjamin. The passage is part of a genealogy tracing the lineage of the tribe of Benjamin. It states that Shaharaim had children by his wives Hushim and Baara in the country of Moab, after he had divorced them. No further details are provided about Baara's life or her children. The mention of Moab suggests that Shaharaim may have lived there for a period of time, either voluntarily or as a result of exile. The genealogy serves to establish the Benjamite heritage of Shaharaim and his descendants.
