Chesil is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Josh.15.30|Joshua 15:30]], as one of the towns in the southernmost region of the territory allocated to the tribe of Judah. It is listed among other towns such as Hormah, Ziklag, and Madmannah. 

No further details are provided about Chesil in the biblical text, such as its exact location, history, or significance. Its inclusion in the list of Judah's towns suggests that it was a recognized settlement during the time of Joshua and the division of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel. 

The name Chesil may be derived from the Hebrew word "kesil," which means "fool" or "stupid one." However, without additional context, the meaning and implications of the town's name remain uncertain.
