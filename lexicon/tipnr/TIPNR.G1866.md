Man living at the time of the New Testament

- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Rom.16.5|Rom.16.5]]; 
- only referred to as Epaenetus **<big>[[G1866|Ἐπαίνετος]]</big>**.

Epaenetus is mentioned by the apostle Paul in his letter to the Romans as a beloved individual and the first convert to Christ in Asia \([[Rom.16.5|Rom.16.5]]\). Asia, in this context, likely refers to the Roman province of Asia, which is located in modern-day Turkey. Being the first convert suggests that Epaenetus was among the earliest believers in that region and played a significant role in the establishment of the church there. Paul's affectionate description of Epaenetus as "my beloved" indicates a close personal relationship between them, possibly forged through shared experiences in ministry. The mention of Epaenetus in Paul's greetings to the Roman church suggests that he may have been known to the believers in Rome, either through his reputation or personal contact. No further details are provided about Epaenetus's life, his specific role in the church, or his later activities. However, his inclusion in Paul's greetings highlights the importance of individual believers and the close-knit relationships within the early Christian community.
