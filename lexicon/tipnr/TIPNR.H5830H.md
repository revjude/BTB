- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Neh.12.1|Neh.12.1]]; 
- only referred to as Ezra<[[H5830H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ֶ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ז</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>\).

Ezra, mentioned in [[Neh.12.1|Nehemiah 12:1]], 13, and 33, was a priest who returned from Babylon to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, during the reign of King Cyrus of Persia. He was among the first group of exiles to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple and the city \(Ezra 2:1-2\). Ezra is listed as the head of a priestly family \([[Neh.12.1|Nehemiah 12:1]]3\), indicating his leadership role within the priestly community. He also participated in the dedication of Jerusalem's wall, where he led one of the two processions of thanksgiving on top of the wall \([[Neh.12.33|Nehemiah 12:33]]\). This Ezra should not be confused with the more prominent Ezra, the priest and scribe, who led a later group of exiles back to Jerusalem and initiated a spiritual reformation among the people.
