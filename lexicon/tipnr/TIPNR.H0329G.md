<small>*Atad between Jericho and the Jordan\(?\) • Threshing floor where Egyptians mourned Jacob*</small>

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Atad</span> was a threshing floor near the Jordan River where the Egyptians mourned Jacob's death.
- A location first mentioned at [[Gen.50.10|Gen.50.10]]; 
- referred to as Atad **<big>[[H0329|אָטָד]]</big>**, or Abel-mizraim \(NIV= Abel Mizraim\)  **<big>[[H0067|אָבֵל מִצְרַיִם]]</big>**.

Atad, also known as Abel-mizraim, was a threshing floor located east of the Jordan River. It was named in the Bible as the place where the funeral procession of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\), led by his son Joseph, stopped to mourn on their way from Egypt to Hebron \([[Gen.50.10|Genesis 50:10]]-11\). The name Abel-mizraim means "mourning of the Egyptians," referring to the seven-day period of lamentation observed by the Egyptians accompanying Joseph. The threshing floor of Atad was likely a prominent landmark in the region, suitable for a large gathering. Its location east of the Jordan suggests that it was in the territory later allotted to the tribes of Reuben or Gad.
