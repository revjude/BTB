Rakkon is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the context of the territory allocated to the tribe of Dan during the division of the Promised Land \(Josh. 19:46\). It is listed along with the nearby city of Joppa \(modern-day Jaffa\) and other towns in the region. The exact location of Rakkon is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the coastal plain of Canaan, near the Mediterranean Sea. The name "Rakkon" is thought to be derived from the Hebrew word "raqq," meaning "thin" or "shallow," possibly referring to the characteristics of the nearby water or land. The mention of Rakkon in the description of Dan's territory highlights the allocation of specific towns and cities to each of the twelve tribes of Israel, fulfilling God's promise to give them the land of Canaan as an inheritance. Although no further details about Rakkon are provided in the Bible, its inclusion in the list of Dan's towns serves to emphasize the orderly division of the land and the establishment of the tribes in their designated areas.
