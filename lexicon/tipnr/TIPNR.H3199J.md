- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.24.17|1Ch.24.17]]; 
- only referred to as Jachin **<big>[[H3199|יָכִין]]</big>**.

Jachin is mentioned in [[1Chr.24.17|1 Chronicles 24:17]] as the head of the twenty-first priestly division established during the reign of King David. This chapter describes how David, along with the chief priests Zadok and Ahimelech, organized the priests into twenty-four divisions for their service in the temple. 

Each division was responsible for serving in the temple for a specific period, ensuring that the priestly duties were carried out continuously throughout the year \(1Ch.24.19\). The order of the divisions was determined by casting lots, and Jachin was selected as the head of the twenty-first division. 

As the head of his division, Jachin would have been responsible for overseeing the priestly duties during his appointed time of service. These duties included offering sacrifices, burning incense, and maintaining the temple's holy vessels and furnishings. 

The organization of the priestly divisions by David was an important step in establishing a structured and efficient system for temple worship. This system continued to be followed even after the construction of Solomon's temple and throughout the history of the divided monarchy. 

No other specific details are provided about Jachin's life or personal characteristics. His inclusion in this list, however, highlights the significance of the priestly divisions and their role in maintaining proper worship in the temple.
