- A man living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, only mentioned at [[Num.13.7|Num.13.7]]; 
- only referred to as Joseph **<big>[[H3130|יוֹסֵף]]</big>**; 
-  father of Igal **<big>[[H3008|יִגְאָל]]</big>**.

Joseph, the son of Igal, was a member of the tribe of Issachar and one of the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan \([[Num.13.7|Numbers 13:7]]\). The twelve spies, one from each tribe, were chosen to assess the land and its inhabitants before the Israelites entered the Promised Land \(Numbers 13:1-2\). After forty days of scouting the land, the spies returned with their report \(Numbers 13:25\). While Joshua and Caleb encouraged the people to trust God and take possession of the land, the other ten spies, including Joseph, brought back a discouraging report, emphasizing the strength of the land's inhabitants and cities \(Numbers 13:26-33\). This led to the people's rebellion against Moses and their refusal to enter the land \(Numbers 14:1-4\). As a result, God declared that the generation who had seen His miracles would not enter the Promised Land, except for Joshua and Caleb \(Numbers 14:20-24\).
