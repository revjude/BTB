- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[John.19.39|Act.6.5]]; 
- only referred to as Nicolaus **<big>[[G3532|Νικόλαος]]</big>**.

Nicolaus was one of the seven men chosen by the early church in Jerusalem to assist the apostles in the daily distribution of food to the widows \(Acts 6:5\). He was a proselyte from Antioch, meaning he was a Gentile convert to Judaism before becoming a follower of Christ. Nicolaus, along with the other six chosen men, was known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. His selection as a deacon highlights the inclusive nature of the early church.
