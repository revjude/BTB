The Corner Gate was one of the gates in the wall surrounding Jerusalem during the period of the Divided Kingdom and the post-exilic era. It is mentioned several times in the Old Testament, particularly in connection with repairs made to the city's fortifications and measurements of the city's perimeter. 

In [[2Kgs.14.13|2 Kings 14:13]] and [[2Chr.25.23|2 Chronicles 25:23]], the Corner Gate is mentioned as one of the points from which King Jehoash of Israel broke down the wall of Jerusalem after defeating King Amaziah of Judah. This suggests that the Corner Gate was a significant and strategic point in the city's defenses. 

During the reign of King Uzziah of Judah, the Corner Gate was fortified and towers were built near it \([[2Chr.26.9|2 Chronicles 26:9]]\). This further emphasizes the gate's importance in the city's defensive structure. 

In the book of Jeremiah, the Corner Gate is mentioned as one of the landmarks in the prophetic description of Jerusalem's future restoration \([[Jer.31.38|Jeremiah 31:38]]\). This passage envisions a time when the city will be rebuilt and expanded, with the Corner Gate marking one of the boundaries of the renewed city. 

The exact location of the Corner Gate is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated at a point where the city wall turned a corner, hence its name. Some scholars suggest that it may have been located near the northwest corner of the city, possibly close to the present-day Jaffa Gate.
