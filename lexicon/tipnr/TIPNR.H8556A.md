Timnath-heres, also known as Timnath-serah, was a town in the hill country of Ephraim that was allotted to Joshua, the son of Nun, as his inheritance after the conquest of Canaan \(Josh. 19:50\). The name "Timnath-heres" means "portion of the sun," while "Timnath-serah" means "portion of abundance." Joshua built the city and settled there \(Josh. 19:50\). After Joshua's death, he was buried in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres \(Judg. 2:9; Josh. 24:30\). The town became a symbol of Joshua's leadership and faithfulness in serving the Lord throughout his life. Its location is believed to be at modern-day Khirbet Tibnah, approximately 20 miles southwest of Shechem.
