Bethuel was the son of Nahor, Abraham's brother, and Milcah, the daughter of Haran \(Gen. 22:22-23\). He lived in Paddan-aram, the region where Abraham's family originated. Bethuel was the father of Rebekah, who became the wife of Isaac, Abraham's son \(Gen. 24:15, 24, 47\). When Abraham's servant was sent to find a wife for Isaac, he was led to Rebekah, and Bethuel, along with his son Laban, agreed to the marriage \(Gen. 24:50-51\). Bethuel's lineage is significant, as it demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would come from his own family line \(Gen. 17:4-7\). Rebekah's marriage to Isaac ensured the continuation of the covenant promise through the next generation \(Gen. 25:20; 28:2, 5\).
