- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Kgs.22.8|1Ki.22.8]]; 
- only referred to as Imlah **<big>[[H3229|יִמְלָא]]</big>**; 
-  father of Micaiah **<big>[[H4321|מִיכָיְהוּ]]</big>**.

Imlah is mentioned in the Bible as the father of the prophet Micaiah, who lived during the reign of King Ahab of Israel. Micaiah is known for his unwavering commitment to speaking the truth, even when it was unpopular or unwelcome. 

In 1 Kings 22 and 2 Chronicles 18, King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah are preparing to go to battle against the Arameans at Ramoth-gilead. Ahab gathers his prophets, who all prophesy victory for the king. However, Jehoshaphat asks if there is another prophet of the Lord who can be consulted. 

Ahab reluctantly mentions Micaiah, son of Imlah, but expresses his disdain for him, saying, "I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil" \([[1Kgs.22.8|1 Kings 22:8]]; [[2Chr.18.7|2 Chronicles 18:7]]\). 

Despite Ahab's reluctance, Micaiah is summoned and initially seems to prophesy victory for the kings. However, when pressed to speak the truth, Micaiah reveals that he saw a vision of Israel scattered on the mountains like sheep without a shepherd, indicating that Ahab would be killed in battle \(1 Kings 22:17; 2 Chronicles 18:16\). 

Micaiah's prophecy angers Ahab, who orders him to be imprisoned and fed with minimal food and water until the king returns safely from battle. However, Micaiah stands firm, declaring that if Ahab returns in peace, then the Lord has not spoken through him \(1 Kings 22:27-28; 2 Chronicles 18:26-27\). 

Although Imlah himself is not mentioned beyond being identified as Micaiah's father, his son's role as a prophet and his unwavering commitment to speaking the truth, even in the face of opposition from the king, suggests that Imlah may have raised his son with a strong faith in God and a commitment to integrity.
