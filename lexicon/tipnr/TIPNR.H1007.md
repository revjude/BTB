Beth-aven, meaning "house of wickedness" or "house of idolatry" in Hebrew, was a town and wilderness area mentioned in the Old Testament. In [[Josh.7.2|Joshua 7:2]], Beth-aven is described as being east of Bethel and near the city of Ai. Spies were sent from Joshua's camp at Gilgal to Ai, and they reported that the city was small and could be easily defeated. However, when the Israelites attacked Ai, they were defeated because of the sin of Achan \(Joshua 7:3-5\). 

In [[Josh.18.12|Joshua 18:12]], Beth-aven is mentioned as part of the northern border of the territory allotted to the tribe of Benjamin, near Bethel. Later, in [[1Sam.13.5|1 Samuel 13:5]], the Philistines gathered their forces at Michmash, east of Beth-aven, in preparation for battle against Israel. During this conflict, Saul's son Jonathan and his armor-bearer initiated an attack on the Philistine garrison, which led to a great victory for Israel \(1 Samuel 14:1-23\). 

The prophets Hosea and Amos used Beth-aven as a derogatory term for Bethel, which had become a center of idolatry in Israel \([[Hos.4.15|Hosea 4:15]]; 5:8; 10:5\). Hosea warned the people not to go to Gilgal or Beth-aven, and Amos denounced the idolatrous practices at Bethel.
