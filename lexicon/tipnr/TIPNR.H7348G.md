Rehum is briefly mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as one of the Levites who helped repair a section of the wall of Jerusalem \([[Neh.3.17|Nehemiah 3:17]]\). During the time of Nehemiah, the walls of Jerusalem were in disrepair, leaving the city vulnerable to attack. Nehemiah, who was serving as cupbearer to King Artaxerxes of Persia, received permission to return to Jerusalem and oversee the rebuilding of the walls \(Nehemiah 2:1-8\). Various individuals and families were assigned to repair specific sections of the wall. Rehum, along with other Levites, worked on a portion of the wall \([[Neh.3.17|Nehemiah 3:17]]\). The mention of Rehum in this context highlights the participation of the Levites in the restoration of Jerusalem's defenses and the importance of each person's contribution to the overall project.
