Mount Esau is a term used in the Book of Obadiah to refer to the mountainous region inhabited by the Edomites, the descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother. The Edomites lived in the area south of the Dead Sea, extending from the Wadi Zered to the Gulf of Aqaba, in what is now southern Jordan and Israel. 

In his prophecy, Obadiah declares God's judgment against Edom for their hostile actions and attitudes toward Israel, particularly during the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem \(Obadiah 1:8, 9, 19, 21\). The Edomites had rejoiced over Judah's destruction and had even participated in looting the city and capturing fleeing Israelites \(Obadiah 1:11-14\). 

Obadiah prophesies that God will bring down the "wise men" and "mighty men" of Edom, and that their mountain stronghold will be unable to protect them from divine judgment \(Obadiah 1:8-9\). He also foretells that the house of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and Joseph will possess the territories of Edom and the surrounding nations, and that deliverers will come from Mount Zion to judge Mount Esau \(Obadiah 1:19, 21\). 

The reference to Mount Esau symbolizes the pride and security of the Edomites in their mountainous territory, as well as their opposition to God's people.
