Uzziel was a goldsmith who participated in repairing the wall of Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah. He is mentioned as one of the people who worked on restoring the city's fortifications after the Babylonian exile. Uzziel, along with Hananiah, one of the perfumers, repaired a section of the wall next to the work of Hananiah son of Shelemiah and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph. The involvement of goldsmiths and perfumers in the wall's repair shows the community-wide effort in rebuilding Jerusalem.
