- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.56|Ezr.2.56]]; 
- only referred to as Giddel **<big>[[H1435|גִּדֵּל]]</big>**.

Giddel is mentioned in [[Ezra.2.56|Ezra 2:56]] and [[Neh.7.58|Nehemiah 7:58]] as an ancestor of a group of Solomon's servants who returned to Jerusalem from the Babylonian exile. Solomon's servants were a distinct group of temple personnel, separate from the Levites and the Nethinim \(Ezra 2:55, 58; Nehemiah 7:57, 60\). They were likely descendants of the Canaanites whom Solomon had conscripted as forced laborers for his building projects, including the construction of the temple \(1 Kings 9:20-21; 2 Chronicles 8:7-8\). In the lists of the exiles who returned to Jerusalem under the leadership of Zerubbabel \(Ezra 2\) and Nehemiah \(Nehemiah 7\), the descendants of Giddel are counted among Solomon's servants. This suggests that Giddel's descendants had continued to serve in the temple, even during the exile, and were part of the group who returned to restore worship in Jerusalem. The inclusion of Solomon's servants in the lists of returning exiles highlights the diverse composition of the Jewish community and the various roles and lineages represented in the temple service.
