Bozkath was a town located in the Shephelah, or lowlands, of Judah \([[Josh.15.39|Joshua 15:39]]\). It is mentioned in the Bible as the birthplace of Jedidah, the mother of King Josiah of Judah \([[2Kgs.22.1|2 Kings 22:1]]\). Josiah was known for his religious reforms and his obedience to the Law of Moses, which was rediscovered during his reign. The fact that Josiah's mother came from Bozkath may suggest that the town had a reputation for religious faithfulness. However, no other details are provided about Bozkath's history, size, or significance.
