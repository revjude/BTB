Gibeah was a town located in the hill country of Judah \([[Josh.15.57|Joshua 15:57]]\). It is mentioned briefly in the context of the cities and villages assigned to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land under Joshua. The exact location of this Gibeah is uncertain, as there are several places with the same name mentioned in the Bible. In [[2Chr.13.2|2 Chronicles 13:2]], Gibeah is identified as the hometown of Maacah \(also known as Micaiah\), the mother of King Abijah of Judah. Abijah was the son of Rehoboam and succeeded him as king. Apart from these two references, no further information is provided about this particular Gibeah in the Bible.
