Man living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Hushim</span>, also known as Shuham, was the son of Dan and the ancestor of the Shuhamite clan within the tribe of Dan.
- A man from the tribe of Dan living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Gen.46.23|Gen.46.23]]; 
- referred to as Hushim **<big>[[H2366|חוּשִׁים]]</big>**, or Shuham **<big>[[H7748|שׁוּחָם]]</big>**, or Shuhamite **<big>[[H7749|שׁוּחָמִי]]</big>**; 
- a son of Dan **<big>[[H1835|דָּן]]</big>**.

Hushim, also referred to as Shuham, is mentioned in [[Gen.46.23|Genesis 46:23]] and [[Num.26.42|Numbers 26:42]]-43 as the son of Dan, one of the twelve sons of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) \(Israel\). In the genealogy of Genesis 46, which records the descendants of Jacob who went down to Egypt, Hushim is listed as the only son of Dan. 

In Numbers 26, during the census of the Israelites in the wilderness, the descendants of Hushim are referred to as the Shuhamites. This suggests that Hushim was also known as Shuham, and his descendants formed a clan within the tribe of Dan. 

The census in Numbers 26 was taken after the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness for 40 years and were preparing to enter the Promised Land. The purpose of the census was to determine the military strength of each tribe and to allocate the land inheritance accordingly. 

The Shuhamites, as descendants of Hushim \(Shuham\), would have been part of the tribe of Dan and would have received their portion of the land inheritance in Canaan. 

The variations in the name \(Hushim and Shuham\) may be due to different spellings or pronunciations used in different traditions or may reflect changes in the name over time.
