Tabrimmon is mentioned in [[1Kgs.15.18|1 Kings 15:18]] as the father of Ben-hadad, who was the king of Syria in Damascus during the reign of Asa king of Judah. Asa made a treaty with Ben-hadad and sent him silver and gold from the temple treasuries to persuade him to break his treaty with Baasha king of Israel. Ben-hadad agreed and attacked the northern cities of Israel, forcing Baasha to stop building Ramah. No other details are provided about Tabrimmon. His name may mean "good is Rimmon," referring to a Syrian deity. As the father of Ben-hadad, Tabrimmon was likely also a king of Syria before his son succeeded him on the throne.
