Man living before Israel's Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Jotham</span>, the youngest son of Gideon, was the only one to escape when Abimelech killed his seventy brothers.
- A man living before Israel's Monarchy, first mentioned at [[Judg.9.5|Jdg.9.5]]; 
- only referred to as Jotham<[[H3147G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יו</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ת</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ם</span>\); 
-  son of Gideon<[[H1439]]>; 
- a brother of Jether<[[H3500G]]> and Abimelech<[[H0040H]]>.

Jotham was the youngest of Gideon's seventy sons \([[Judg.9.5|Judges 9:5]]\). After Gideon's death, Abimelech, another of Gideon's sons, conspired to become king and killed his seventy brothers on one stone \([[Judg.9.5|Judges 9:5]]\). However, Jotham escaped by hiding \([[Judg.9.5|Judges 9:5]]\). 

Jotham went to Mount Gerizim and delivered a parable to the men of Shechem, warning them of the consequences of their actions in supporting Abimelech \([[Judg.9.7|Judges 9:7]]-21\). In the parable, the trees sought to anoint a king over them, but the worthy trees \(olive, fig, and vine\) refused, while the bramble accepted and threatened to devour the cedars of Lebanon \(Judges 9:8-15\). Jotham then fled to Beer and remained there, fearing Abimelech \([[Judg.9.21|Judges 9:21]]\). 

Later, God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem, causing them to turn against each other \(Judges 9:22-25\). This ultimately led to Abimelech's downfall and death, which was seen as a fulfillment of Jotham's curse \([[Judg.9.5|Judges 9:5]]7\).
