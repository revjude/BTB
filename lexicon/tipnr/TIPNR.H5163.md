Naham is briefly mentioned in [[1Chr.4.19|1 Chronicles 4:19]] as part of the genealogy of the descendants of Judah. He is described as the  brother of Hodiah whose son founded Keilah the Garmite city.. No additional information is provided about Naham's life, occupation, or character. 

The context of the passage suggests that Naham was a member of the tribe of Judah and lived during the period of the judges or the early monarchy of Israel. The genealogical record in 1 Chronicles 4 traces the lineage of several clans within the tribe of Judah, demonstrating the importance of family heritage and tribal identity in ancient Israelite society. 

Naham's son, Keilah the Garmite, is distinguished by the epithet "Garmite," which may indicate a connection to a specific location or clan. However, no further details are given about Keilah or the significance of his title. 

The inclusion of Naham in this genealogy, despite the lack of additional information, highlights the importance of preserving family lineages and the recognition of each individual's place within their tribal heritage.
