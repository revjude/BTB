Shaphir is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the context of the prophet Micah's oracle against the towns of Judah \(Mic. 1:11\). In his prophecy, Micah addresses Shaphir, urging the inhabitants to pass on in nakedness and shame, a sign of humiliation and judgment. The exact location of Shaphir is unknown, but it was likely situated in the Shephelah region, the western foothills of Judah. The name "Shaphir" is derived from the Hebrew word meaning "beautiful" or "pleasant," possibly indicating the town's attractive appearance or setting. However, the prophecy suggests that Shaphir's beauty would be stripped away as a result of God's judgment on the nation. The mention of Shaphir alongside other towns in Micah's oracle highlights the widespread nature of the divine judgment and the consequences of Judah's unfaithfulness.
