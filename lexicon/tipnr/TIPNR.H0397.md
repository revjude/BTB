Achish, also known as Abimelech, was the Philistine king of Gath during the time of King Saul and King David. When David fled from Saul, he sought refuge in Gath, pretending to be insane to avoid being perceived as a threat \([[1Sam.21.10|1 Samuel 21:10]]-15\). Achish's servants recognized David as the celebrated Israelite warrior, but David's act of insanity convinced Achish to dismiss him \([[1Sam.21.11|1 Samuel 21:11]]-15\). 

Later, when David was again fleeing from Saul, he returned to Achish in Gath, this time with a group of 600 men \(1 Samuel 27:1-4\). Achish granted David and his men the town of Ziklag as a base \([[1Sam.27.5|1 Samuel 27:5]]-6\). David and his men raided the Geshurites, Girzites, and Amalekites, but deceived Achish into believing that they were raiding the Israelites and their allies \(1 Samuel 27:8-12\). 

When the Philistines gathered their forces to fight against Israel, Achish brought David and his men with him \([[1Sam.28.1|1 Samuel 28:1]]-2\). However, the Philistine commanders objected to David's presence, fearing that he might turn against them in battle \(1 Samuel 29:1-5\). Achish, trusting in David's loyalty, defended him, but ultimately sent him back to Ziklag \([[1Sam.29.6|1 Samuel 29:6]]-11\). 

After David became king, some of his servants fled to Achish in Gath \([[1Kgs.2.39|1 Kings 2:39]]-40\), indicating that David maintained a relationship with Achish even after becoming king. 

Psalm 34 is attributed to David when he pretended to be insane before Abimelech \(Achish\), who drove him away \(Psalm 34:1\). The psalm expresses David's trust in God and his deliverance from fear and trouble.
