- A priest living before Israel's Monarchy, first mentioned at [[Judg.17.1|Jdg.17.1]]; 
- referred to as Micah **<big>[[H4318|מִיכָה]]</big>**, or Micah **<big>[[H4321|מִיכָיְהוּ]]</big>**.

Micah is a man from the hill country of Ephraim who is featured in a narrative in the book of Judges \([[Judg.17.1|Jdg.17.1]]8\). He stole 1,100 pieces of silver from his mother but later returned them. His mother then dedicated 200 pieces of silver to the Lord for Micah to make a carved image and a metal idol \([[Judg.17.1|Jdg.17.1]]-4\). Micah set up these idols in his house, along with an ephod and household gods, and installed one of his sons as his priest \([[Judg.17.5|Jdg.17.5]]\). Later, a Levite from Bethlehem came to Micah's house, and Micah hired him to be his personal priest \([[Judg.17.8|Jdg.17.8]]-13\). The Danites, who were seeking land to settle, sent spies who stayed at Micah's house. They later returned with 600 armed men, stole Micah's idols and his priest, and went on to conquer the city of Laish \(Jdg.18.1-29\). This narrative highlights the religious and moral decline in Israel during the time of the judges, when "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" \(Jdg.17.6; 21.25\).
