Athlai is mentioned in Ezra 10 as one of the men who had married foreign women during the time of Ezra. After the return from Babylonian captivity, Ezra discovered that many Israelites, including priests and Levites, had intermarried with the neighboring peoples, going against God's commands. Ezra called for a assembly and urged the people to confess their sin and separate themselves from their foreign wives. Athlai was among those who agreed to put away their foreign wives and children, demonstrating his commitment to obey God's laws and maintain the purity of the Israelite community.
