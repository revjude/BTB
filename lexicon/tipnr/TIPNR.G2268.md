Isaiah was one of the major prophets of the Old Testament, active during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah \([[Isa.1.1|Isa.1.1]]\). He brought messages of judgment and hope, foretelling the Babylonian exile and the future restoration of God's people. 

Isaiah advised kings in several crises, including the Syro-Ephraimite threat against Ahaz \(Isa.7\) and Sennacherib's invasion during Hezekiah's reign \(2Ki.19, Isa.37\). He also confronted Hezekiah for entertaining Babylonian envoys \(2Ki.20, Isa.39\). 

Isaiah's prophecies contain strong themes of God's holiness, judgment against sin, and the coming of the Messianic king and Suffering Servant. Many of his prophecies were fulfilled in the life of Jesus Christ, as noted in the New Testament \(e.g., [[Matt.4.14|Mat.4.14]]-16, [[Luke.4.17|Luk.4.17]]-21, [[John.12.38|Jhn.12.38]]-41\). 

Isaiah's ministry included dramatic prophetic signs, such as walking barefoot and naked for three years \(Isa.20\) and giving his sons symbolic names \([[Isa.7.3|Isa.7.3]], 8.3\). Jewish tradition says he was martyred by being sawn in two during Manasseh's evil reign \(cf. Heb.11.37\). Isaiah is considered one of the greatest literary prophets, and his book is sometimes called "the fifth Gospel" for its rich messianic imagery.
