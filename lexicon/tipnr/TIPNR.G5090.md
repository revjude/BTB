Timaeus is mentioned in [[Mark.10.46|Mark 10:46]] as the father of Bartimaeus, a blind beggar who encountered Jesus on the road to Jericho. The name Bartimaeus literally means "son of Timaeus," indicating that he was known primarily by his relationship to his father. In the biblical account, Bartimaeus was sitting by the roadside when he heard that Jesus was passing by. He cried out, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!" Despite the crowd's attempts to silence him, Bartimaeus persisted in calling out to Jesus. Jesus stopped and called for Bartimaeus to come to him. When asked what he wanted, Bartimaeus replied, "Rabbi, I want to see." Jesus then healed him, saying, "Go, your faith has healed you." Immediately, Bartimaeus received his sight and followed Jesus.
