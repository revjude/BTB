Meshullam is mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as one of the priests who stood beside Ezra during the public reading of the Law \([[Neh.8.4|Neh.8.4]]\). After the completion of the wall of Jerusalem, the people gathered to hear Ezra read the Book of the Law. Ezra stood on a wooden platform built for this purpose, and beside him stood several priests, including Meshullam. The presence of these priests alongside Ezra emphasizes the importance and solemnity of the occasion, as well as the role of the priesthood in teaching and upholding the Law.
