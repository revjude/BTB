- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[2Tim.1.15|2Ti.1.15]]; 
- only referred to as Hermogenes **<big>[[G2061|Ἑρμογένης]]</big>**.

Hermogenes is mentioned briefly in Paul's second letter to Timothy as one of the believers in Asia who deserted Paul during his imprisonment. Along with Phygellus, Hermogenes is cited as an example of those who turned away from Paul in his time of need \([[2Tim.1.15|2Ti.1.15]]\). The exact circumstances of this desertion are not specified, but it likely occurred during Paul's final imprisonment in Rome. Paul's mention of Hermogenes' abandonment serves as a contrast to the faithfulness of Onesiphorus, who diligently sought out Paul and refreshed him \(2Ti.1.16-18\). No other details about Hermogenes' background, conversion, or reasons for deserting Paul are provided in the Bible. \([[2Tim.1.15|2Ti.1.15]]\).
