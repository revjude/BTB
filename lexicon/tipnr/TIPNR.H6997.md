Hakkatan is mentioned in [[Ezra.8.12|Ezra 8:12]] as the father of Johanan, who was one of the leaders that returned to Jerusalem from Babylonian exile. Johanan is described as "of the sons of Azgad" and was accompanied by 110 males. The return from exile was a significant event in Jewish history, as it marked the end of the Babylonian captivity and the beginning of the restoration of Jerusalem and the temple. Ezra, a priest and scribe, led a group of exiles back to Jerusalem and was instrumental in teaching the people the Law of Moses and instituting religious reforms.
