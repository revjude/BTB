Shemaiah, also known as Shemaiah the Nehelamite, was a false prophet who lived among the exiles in Babylon during the time of Jeremiah. According to [[Jer.29.24|Jeremiah 29:24]]-32, Shemaiah sent letters to the people and priests in Jerusalem, contradicting Jeremiah's prophetic messages and accusing him of being a false prophet. Shemaiah urged the priest Zephaniah to rebuke and imprison Jeremiah for his prophecies. However, the Lord revealed to Jeremiah that Shemaiah was a false prophet who was leading the people astray. As a result, Jeremiah prophesied that Shemaiah and his descendants would be punished, and none of them would see the good that God would do for His people. This incident underscores the conflict between true and false prophets during the Babylonian exile and the importance of discerning genuine prophetic messages.
