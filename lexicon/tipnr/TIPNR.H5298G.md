- A man from the tribe of Levi living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, only mentioned at [[Exod.6.21|Exo.6.21]]; 
- only referred to as Nepheg<[[H5298G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ֶ֫<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>פ</span>ֶ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ג</span>\); 
-  son of Izhar<[[H3324]]>;

Nepheg is mentioned in [[Exod.6.21|Exodus 6:21]] as one of the sons of Izhar, who was a grandson of Levi, the founder of the Levite tribe. The Levites were set apart by God to serve in the tabernacle and, later, in the temple. 

The reference to Nepheg occurs in the context of God's instructions to Moses regarding the organization and duties of the Levites. The Levites were divided into three main clans: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Izhar, Nepheg's father, belonged to the clan of Kohath. 

The Kohathites were responsible for the care and transportation of the most sacred items in the tabernacle, including the ark of the covenant, the table of showbread, the lampstand, and the altars \(Numbers 3:27-32\). As a member of this clan, Nepheg would have been part of a family entrusted with these important duties. 

Apart from this genealogical mention, no further information is provided about Nepheg's life or specific role within the Levite community. His inclusion in the record serves to highlight the importance of family lineage in the organization and responsibilities of the Levites. 

The Levites' dedication to the service of God and their role in maintaining the sacred objects and rituals of worship were essential to the spiritual life of the Israelite community. Nepheg's mention, along with other Levites, underscores the significance of this tribe in the religious and social structure of ancient Israel.
