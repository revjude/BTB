Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Iddo</span>, also known as Adaia, was a priest who returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel and was head of a priestly family during the time of Joiakim.
- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Neh.12.4|Neh.12.4]]; 
- referred to as Iddo **<big>[[H5714|עִדּוֹ]]</big>**, or Iddo \(=Qere. Ketiv=Adaia\)  **<big>[[H5714|עִדּוֹ]]</big>**, or Adaia \(=Ketiv\)  **<big>[[H5718|עֲדָיָה]]</big>**.

Iddo, also referred to as Adaia, is mentioned in [[Neh.12.4|Nehemiah 12:4]] and 12:16 as a priest who returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, after the Babylonian exile. He is listed among the priests who came back to Jerusalem to help rebuild the city and restore the temple worship. 

In [[Neh.12.4|Nehemiah 12:4]], Iddo is mentioned along with other priests such as Shecaniah, Rehum, and Meremoth, who were among the first to return to Jerusalem. This suggests that Iddo was a prominent figure among the returning priests and played a significant role in the restoration of the temple and its services. 

Later, in [[Neh.12.16|Nehemiah 12:16]], Iddo is mentioned again, this time as the head of a priestly family during the time of Joiakim, the son of Jeshua. Jeshua was the high priest who had returned with Zerubbabel. This indicates that Iddo's family continued to serve as priests in the restored temple, and he held a leadership position among them. 

The fact that Iddo is also referred to as Adaia suggests that he may have had two names or that the names were used interchangeably. This was not uncommon in ancient times, especially during the post-exilic period when many Jews had both Hebrew and Babylonian names. 

Iddo's involvement in the restoration of the temple and his leadership role among the priests highlight the importance of the priestly families in maintaining the religious life of the Jewish community after the exile. The mention of his name in the context of the returning priests and the priestly families also emphasizes the continuity of the priestly lineage and their dedication to serving God in the restored temple.
