Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Malchijah</span>, a descendant of Parosh, divorced his foreign wife during Ezra's reforms \(Ezr.10.25\).
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at Ezr.10.25; 
- only referred to as Malchijah **<big>[[H4441|מַלְכִּיָּה]]</big>**.

Malchijah was a man from the family of Parosh who had married a foreign woman during the time of Ezra. As part of Ezra's reforms to purify the Jewish community, Malchijah and others who had married foreign wives were required to divorce them \(Ezra 10:25\). The presence of two similar men in the same verse named Malchijah in this list either indicates that it was a common name during this period, or a scribal error.
