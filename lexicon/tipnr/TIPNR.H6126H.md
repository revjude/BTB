Akkub was a Levite who belonged to the family of gatekeepers during the post-exilic period, after the return of the Jews from Babylonian captivity. He is mentioned in several lists of Levites and Temple servants in the books of 1 Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah. 

In the genealogy of the Levites who settled in Jerusalem, Akkub is listed among the gatekeepers who were responsible for guarding the entrances to the Temple. \([[1Chr.9.17|1Ch.9.17]]\) The gatekeepers played a crucial role in maintaining the sanctity and security of the Temple premises. 

Akkub is also mentioned among the Levites who returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, after the Babylonian exile. \([[Ezra.2.42|Ezr.2.42]]; [[Neh.7.45|Neh.7.45]]\) This indicates that he or his descendants were part of the group that helped rebuild the Temple and restore the worship practices in Jerusalem. 

Later, during the time of Nehemiah, Akkub is listed among the gatekeepers who were entrusted with the task of guarding the storehouses of the Temple gates. \([[Neh.11.19|Neh.11.19]]\) These storehouses likely contained the tithes, offerings, and other resources necessary for the maintenance of the Temple and the support of the Levites. 

In the context of the dedication of the rebuilt wall of Jerusalem, Akkub is mentioned among the Levites who were involved in the purification rituals and the celebration that followed. \([[Neh.12.25|Neh.12.25]]\) 

Akkub's repeated mention in the lists of Levites and Temple servants highlights the importance of the gatekeeper's role in the post-exilic Jewish community. They were responsible for maintaining order, protecting the Temple, and ensuring that the sacred space remained pure and secure.
