Ozem was one of the sons of Jesse and a brother of King David \([[1Chr.2.15|1 Chronicles 2:15]]\). He is mentioned in the genealogy of Judah, which lists the descendants of Jesse. Ozem is named as the sixth son of Jesse, with his brothers being Eliab, Abinadab, Shimea, Nethanel, Raddai, and David \(1 Chronicles 2:13-15\). The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 2 provides insight into the family background of David, Israel's most famous king. However, no further details about Ozem's life or role are provided in the Bible.
