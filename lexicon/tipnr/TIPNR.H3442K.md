Jeshua is mentioned briefly in Ezra as one of the priests who received the temple treasures that were brought back from Babylon. These treasures, which included gold and silver vessels, had been taken from the temple by the Babylonians during the conquest of Jerusalem. When the exiles returned, they brought these treasures back to be used in the rebuilt temple. Jeshua, along with other priests, was responsible for ensuring that the treasures were properly accounted for and stored until the temple was ready for use.
