Jashub, also referred to as Yob, was one of the sons of Issachar, as recorded in [[Num.26.24|Numbers 26:24]], [[1Chr.7.1|1 Chronicles 7:1]], and [[Gen.46.13|Genesis 46:13]]. He was born to Issachar, the ninth son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and Leah, during the time when the Israelites lived in Canaan. In [[Gen.46.13|Genesis 46:13]], Jashub is mentioned as one of the descendants of Jacob who went down to Egypt during the famine, along with his father and brothers. The name "Yob" appears to be an alternate spelling or pronunciation of his name. In [[Num.26.24|Numbers 26:24]], Jashub is listed as one of the clans of Issachar during the census taken in the wilderness. This suggests that his descendants formed a significant subgroup within the tribe of Issachar. The Bible does not provide any further details about Jashub's life or his role in the events of Israel's history.
