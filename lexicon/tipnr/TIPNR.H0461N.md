- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.18|Ezr.10.18]]; 
- only referred to as Eliezer **<big>[[H0461|אֱלִיעֶזֶר]]</big>**.

Eliezer is mentioned as one of the priests who had married foreign women during the Babylonian exile \([[Ezra.10.18|Ezr.10.18]]\). After the return to Jerusalem, Ezra discovered that many of the Israelites, including priests and Levites, had intermarried with the neighboring peoples. This was a violation of God's command not to intermarry with the pagan nations. Eliezer was among those who had taken foreign wives, but he agreed to put away his wife as part of the covenant renewal led by Ezra. The Bible does not provide any further details about Eliezer's life or priestly service.
