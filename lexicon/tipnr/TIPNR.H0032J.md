Abihail is mentioned in [[2Chr.11.18|2 Chronicles 11:18]] as the mother of Mahalath, who became one of King Rehoboam's wives. Rehoboam was the son of Solomon and the first king of the southern kingdom of Judah after the division of the united monarchy. Mahalath's father was Jerimoth, one of David's sons. 

The marriage of Rehoboam to Mahalath was likely a political alliance, as it strengthened Rehoboam's connection to the Davidic dynasty.
