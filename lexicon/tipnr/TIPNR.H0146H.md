Addar, also known as Ard, was a son of Bela, who was one of the sons of Benjamin, the patriarch \([[1Chr.8.3|1 Chronicles 8:3]]\). He is mentioned in the genealogy of the tribe of Benjamin, which lists the descendants of Benjamin's sons. 

In the parallel genealogies found in Genesis 46:21 and Numbers 26:40, Addar is referred to as Ard. This variation in names is not uncommon in biblical genealogies and may be due to differences in spelling, pronunciation, or the use of alternative names for the same individual. 

As a grandson of Benjamin, Addar would have been part of the generation that entered Egypt with Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and his family \(Genesis 46:1-27\). The tribe of Benjamin, along with the other Israelite tribes, grew in number during their time in Egypt and later participated in the Exodus under the leadership of Moses. 

No further information is provided about Addar's life, his role within the tribe, or any notable events associated with him. His mention in the genealogy serves to document the descendants of Benjamin and to highlight the continuity of the tribal lineage from the time of the patriarchs to the formation of the nation of Israel.
