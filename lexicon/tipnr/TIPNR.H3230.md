Jamlech is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.4.34|1 Chronicles 4:34]] as one of the leaders from the tribe of Simeon during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. He is listed along with other Simeonite leaders, including Meshobab, Jamlech, Joshah son of Amaziah, Joel, Jehu son of Joshibiah, and others. These leaders are described as having gone to the region of Gedor, east of the valley, in search of pasture for their flocks. This event likely took place during a time of peace and prosperity in Judah, as Hezekiah was known for his religious reforms and his trust in God \(2 Chronicles 29-31\).
