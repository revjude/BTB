Manasseh was the firstborn son of Joseph and Asenath, born in Egypt before the famine. When Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) blessed Joseph's sons, he gave the greater blessing to Ephraim, the younger son, despite Joseph's objection. The tribe of Manasseh, along with Ephraim, became one of the twelve tribes of Israel. 

During the Exodus, the tribe of Manasseh was counted in the census and arranged in the camp under their standard. They had a significant population and contributed to the army. Notable descendants of Manasseh include Gaddi, who was among the twelve spies sent to explore Canaan, and Zelophehad's daughters, who received an inheritance among their uncles due to their father's lack of sons. 

When the Promised Land was divided, half of the tribe of Manasseh settled east of the Jordan River, while the other half settled west of the Jordan. The eastern portion of Manasseh, along with Reuben and Gad, assisted in the conquest of Canaan before returning to their inheritance. The western portion of Manasseh received cities and territories, including the city of refuge, Golan. 

Throughout Israel's history, the tribe of Manasseh played significant roles. They participated in the conquest of Canaan, fought alongside Gideon against the Midianites, and joined David's army. However, they also faced challenges, such as incomplete conquest of their territories and occasional conflicts with other tribes. 

In later prophecies, Manasseh is mentioned as part of the restored Israel. The tribe is also listed among the sealed servants of God in the Book of Revelation. 

Manasseh is also used to refer to the territory allotted to the tribe of Manasseh. The tribe's inheritance was divided between the eastern and western portions of the Promised Land. 

The eastern portion of Manasseh's territory was conquered by Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, and was named Havvoth-jair. This region was known for its small towns and villages. 

The western portion of Manasseh's territory was located in the heart of Canaan. It included cities such as Beth-shean, Ibleam, Dor, En-dor, Taanach, and Megiddo, along with their villages. However, the Manassites were unable to drive out the Canaanites from these cities completely. 

Manasseh's territory also included the city of refuge, Golan, in the region of Bashan. This city was designated as a place of asylum for those who unintentionally caused the death of another person. 

The territory of Manasseh is mentioned in the context of the conquest of Canaan, the division of the land among the tribes, and the establishment of cities of refuge. It is also noted in the description of the regions that remained loyal to the house of David during the reign of King Pekah of Israel.
