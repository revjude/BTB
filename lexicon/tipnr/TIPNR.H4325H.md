The Water Gate was one of the gates in the wall of Jerusalem, mentioned in the Book of Nehemiah in connection with the city's rebuilding and spiritual renewal. During the reconstruction of Jerusalem's walls, the Nethinim \(temple servants\) and the merchants made repairs on the wall as far as the Water Gate \(Neh. 3:26\). Later, when Ezra the scribe read the Book of the Law to the people, he did so in the square before the Water Gate \(Neh. 8:1, 3\). The people listened attentively and responded with worship and repentance. During the celebration of the Feast of Tabernacles, the people gathered at the Water Gate to hear the Law read and to celebrate the feast \(Neh. 8:16\). The Water Gate is also mentioned in the description of the dedication of the rebuilt wall, where two choirs proceeded along the wall in opposite directions, with one group going past the Water Gate \(Neh. 12:37\). The exact location of the Water Gate is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated on the eastern side of Jerusalem, near the Gihon Spring, which provided a vital water source for the city. The Water Gate's association with the reading of the Law and the celebration of the Feast of Tabernacles emphasizes its importance as a place of spiritual renewal and community gathering in post-exilic Jerusalem.
