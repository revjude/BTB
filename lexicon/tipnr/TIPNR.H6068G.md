Anathoth was a city in the territory of Benjamin, located approximately 3 miles \(5 km\) northeast of Jerusalem. It was assigned to the Levites, specifically the descendants of Aaron, as one of their cities \([[Josh.21.18|Joshua 21:18]]; [[1Chr.6.60|1 Chronicles 6:60]]\). 

The city is most notably associated with the prophet Jeremiah, who was born in Anathoth \([[Jer.1.1|Jeremiah 1:1]]\). Jeremiah faced opposition from the people of his hometown, who plotted against his life because of his prophecies \([[Jer.11.21|Jeremiah 11:21]]-23\). The prophet also received a divine command to purchase a field in Anathoth, which served as a sign of the future restoration of Judah \([[Jer.32.7|Jeremiah 32:7]]-9\). 

Several prominent figures in the Bible were associated with Anathoth, including Abiathar, a priest during the reign of King Solomon, who was exiled to Anathoth after supporting Adonijah's claim to the throne \([[1Kgs.2.26|1 Kings 2:26]]\). Two of David's mighty men, Abiezer and Jehu, were also from Anathoth \([[2Sam.23.27|2 Samuel 23:27]]; [[1Chr.11.28|1 Chronicles 11:28]]; 12:3; 27:12\). 

Anathoth was among the towns resettled by the Benjamites after the Babylonian exile \([[Ezra.2.23|Ezra 2:23]]; [[Neh.7.27|Nehemiah 7:27]]; 11:32\). The city is also mentioned in a prophetic context, as Isaiah declares judgment upon it \([[Isa.10.30|Isaiah 10:30]]\), and Jeremiah confronts a false prophet from Anathoth named Pashhur \([[Jer.29.27|Jeremiah 29:27]]\). 

The biblical references to Anathoth highlight its significance as a Levitical city, its connection to the life and ministry of Jeremiah, and its role in the history of Israel, particularly during the divided monarchy and the post-exilic period.
