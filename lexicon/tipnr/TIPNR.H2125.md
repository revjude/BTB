Zizah, also known as Zina, was a Gershonite Levite mentioned in the genealogy of the Levites during the reign of King David. He was the second son of Shimei, who was a descendant of Gershon, one of the three main divisions of the Levites. In 1 Chronicles 23, Zizah is listed among the sons of Shimei, along with his brothers Jahath, Jeush, and Beriah. The passage notes that Jahath was the chief and Zizah was second in rank. However, it also mentions that Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they were counted as a single family. This suggests that the Gershonite families were organized based on the number of male descendants they had. As a Levite, Zizah would have had responsibilities related to the tabernacle and later the temple services, although his specific role is not mentioned in the text.
