- A priest living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Chr.24.7|1Ch.24.7]]; 
- only referred to as Jedaiah **<big>[[H3048|יְדַעְיָה]]</big>**.

Jedaiah is mentioned in [[1Chr.24.7|1 Chronicles 24:7]] as the head of the second priestly division during the reign of King David. David organized the priests into twenty-four divisions to ensure a systematic and orderly approach to temple service. Jedaiah's division was the second to serve in the temple rotation. In [[Ezra.2.36|Ezra 2:36]] and [[Neh.7.39|Nehemiah 7:39]], the descendants of Jedaiah are listed among the priests who returned to Jerusalem from the Babylonian exile. This indicates that Jedaiah's family continued to serve as priests throughout the generations, even during the exile. The return of Jedaiah's descendants highlights the continuity of the priestly lineage and the importance of the temple service in the restoration of Jewish worship after the exile.
