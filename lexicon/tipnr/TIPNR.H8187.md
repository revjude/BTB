Sheariah, mentioned in [[1Chr.8.38|1 Chronicles 8:38]] and 9:44, was a descendant of Benjamin and the son of Azel. He is listed in the genealogical records of the tribe of Benjamin, which trace the lineage of prominent figures within the tribe. Sheariah is named along with his brothers Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Azarel, and Hanan, all of whom were the sons of Azel. The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 8 and 9 provides a detailed account of the descendants of Benjamin, particularly focusing on the family of Saul, the first king of Israel. The repetition of Sheariah's name in both chapters emphasizes his place within the Benjamite lineage. However, the text does not provide any specific details about Sheariah's life, his role within the tribe, or any notable achievements. The inclusion of his name in the genealogical record serves to establish the continuity of the Benjamite lineage and highlight the importance of family ties within the tribe.
