Geshur was an Aramean kingdom located northeast of the Sea of Galilee, in the region of Bashan. It bordered the Israelite territories of Manasseh and Maacah, as mentioned in Deuteronomy 3:14 and [[Josh.12.5|Joshua 12:5]]; 13:11. 

The kingdom of Geshur played a significant role in the life of King David and his family. David married Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur \([[2Sam.3.3|2 Samuel 3:3]]; [[1Chr.3.2|1 Chronicles 3:2]]\). Maacah was the mother of Absalom and Tamar, two of David's children who were involved in a tragic family conflict. 

After Absalom murdered his half-brother Amnon in revenge for the rape of his sister Tamar, he fled to Geshur and sought refuge with his grandfather, King Talmai \([[2Sam.13.37|2 Samuel 13:37]]-38\). Absalom remained in Geshur for three years before Joab, David's commander, arranged for his return to Jerusalem \([[2Sam.14.23|2 Samuel 14:23]],32\). 

Later, when Absalom rebelled against his father David, he went to Geshur to gather support and raise an army \([[2Sam.15.8|2 Samuel 15:8]]\). This suggests that Absalom maintained ties with his maternal grandfather's kingdom and used it as a base for his political ambitions. 

In [[Josh.13.13|Joshua 13:13]], it is mentioned that the Israelites did not drive out the Geshurites, indicating that they coexisted with the Aramean kingdom. However, during the reign of Solomon, it seems that Geshur came under Israelite control, as [[1Chr.2.23|1 Chronicles 2:23]] mentions that Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took Geshur and Aram and their towns. 

The biblical narrative portrays Geshur as an independent Aramean kingdom that had close ties with the Israelite royal family through marriage alliances. Its location and political significance made it a place of refuge and a potential source of support for those involved in the power struggles within the Israelite monarchy.
