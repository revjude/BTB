Bezalel, the son of Uri and grandson of Hur from the tribe of Judah, was a skilled craftsman chosen by God to oversee the construction of the tabernacle and its furnishings \(Exo. 31:2; 35:30; 1 Ch. 2:20\). God filled Bezalel with His Spirit, giving him wisdom, understanding, and knowledge in all kinds of craftsmanship, including working with gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood \(Exo. 31:3-5\). Bezalel, along with Oholiab from the tribe of Dan, led the skilled workers in creating the tabernacle, the ark of the covenant, the altar, and all the other sacred items according to the divine instructions given to Moses \(Exo. 36:1-2; 37:1; 38:22\). Bezalel's exceptional skills and divine empowerment underscore the importance of the tabernacle as a place where God's presence would dwell among His people. The tabernacle and its furnishings, crafted by Bezalel, were later brought to Jerusalem by King Solomon \(2 Ch. 1:5\).
