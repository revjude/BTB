Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Eliezer</span> was an Israelite who married a foreign woman during the exile \([[Ezra.10.31|Ezr.10.31]]\).
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.31|Ezr.10.31]]; 
- only referred to as Eliezer **<big>[[H0461|אֱלִיעֶזֶר]]</big>**.

Eliezer is listed among the descendants of Harim who had married foreign women during the Babylonian exile \([[Ezra.10.31|Ezr.10.31]]\). After the return to Jerusalem, Ezra discovered that many of the Israelites had intermarried with the neighboring peoples. This was a violation of God's command not to intermarry with the pagan nations. Eliezer was one of those who had taken a foreign wife, but he agreed to put away his wife as part of the covenant renewal led by Ezra. The Bible does not provide any additional information about Eliezer's life or family.
