<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Ishmael</span>, son of Nethaniah, assassinated Gedaliah the governor and led captives to Ammon before being pursued by Johanan \([[2Kgs.25.23|2Ki.25.23]],25; Jer.40-41\).
- An adversary of Jeremiah living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Kgs.25.23|2Ki.25.23]]; 
- only referred to as Ishmael<[[H3458H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ש</span>ְׁ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>מ</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ֵ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>אל</span>\); 
- a son of Nethaniah<[[H5418G]]>.

Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, was a member of the royal family of Judah \([[2Kgs.25.25|2Ki.25.25]]\). After the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and appointed Gedaliah as governor over the remnant, Ishmael and other army officers came to Gedaliah at Mizpah \([[2Kgs.25.23|2Ki.25.23]]; [[Jer.40.8|Jer.40.8]]\). 

Despite being warned of Ishmael's treacherous intentions \(Jer.40.13-16\), Gedaliah welcomed him. However, Ishmael, acting under the orders of Baalis, king of the Ammonites, assassinated Gedaliah and his men \([[2Kgs.25.25|2Ki.25.25]]; [[Jer.41.1|Jer.41.1]]-3\). 

Ishmael then led captives, including the king's daughters, from Mizpah toward Ammon \([[Jer.41.1|Jer.41.1]]0\). When Johanan and the other leaders heard of Ishmael's actions, they pursued him. Ishmael's captives were rescued, but he escaped to the Ammonites with eight men \([[Jer.41.1|Jer.41.1]]1-15\). 

Ishmael's treachery further devastated the remnant of Judah after the Babylonian conquest. His actions led the survivors to flee to Egypt out of fear of Babylonian reprisals \([[Jer.41.1|Jer.41.1]]6-18\), directly disobeying God's command through Jeremiah \(Jer.42-43\).
