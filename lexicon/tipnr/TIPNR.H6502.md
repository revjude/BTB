Piram was the Amorite king of Jarmuth, a city in the Shephelah region of Canaan, during the time of Joshua's conquest of the Promised Land. In [[Josh.10.3|Joshua 10:3]], Piram is mentioned as one of the five Amorite kings who formed a coalition against the Israelites after the fall of Jericho and Ai. The other kings in this alliance were Adoni-Zedek of Jerusalem, Hoham of Hebron, Japhia of Lachish, and Debir of Eglon. These kings united their forces to attack Gibeon, a city that had made a peace treaty with Israel. In response, Joshua and the Israelite army came to Gibeon's defense, and with the help of God, they defeated the Amorite coalition, capturing and executing the five kings, including Piram \(Joshua 10:16-27\). This victory was a significant milestone in the Israelites' conquest of Canaan.
