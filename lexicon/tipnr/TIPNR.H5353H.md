Man living at the time of Exile and Return

The descendants of <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Nekoda</span> were among those who could not prove their priestly lineage after returning from the Babylonian exile.
- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.60|Ezr.2.60]]; 
- only referred to as Nekoda **<big>[[H5353|נְקוֹדָא]]</big>**.

Nekoda is mentioned in [[Ezra.2.60|Ezra 2:60]] and [[Neh.7.62|Nehemiah 7:62]] as one of the families who returned to Jerusalem from Babylonian captivity but were unable to prove their lineage as Israelites or priests. This incident occurred during the time of Zerubbabel, who led the first group of exiles back to Jerusalem around 538 BC. 

According to the text, the descendants of Nekoda, along with those of Delaiah and Tobiah, sought to be included among the priests but could not find their names in the genealogical records. As a result, they were considered unclean and excluded from the priesthood. 

The importance of genealogical records in determining priestly lineage is evident from this account. The priests were required to prove their descent from Aaron, the first high priest, to be eligible for service in the temple. The inability of the Nekoda family to establish their priestly heritage suggests that their ancestors may have been among those who had intermarried with non-Israelites during the exile, thus compromising their lineage. 

The exclusion of the Nekoda family from the priesthood highlights the significance of maintaining the purity and integrity of the priestly line. It also underscores the challenges faced by the returning exiles in reestablishing their religious and social order after years of captivity in a foreign land. 

Apart from this incident, no further information is provided about the Nekoda family or their subsequent role in the post-exilic Jewish community.
