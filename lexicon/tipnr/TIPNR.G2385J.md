James, the son of Alphaeus, was one of the Twelve Apostles chosen by Jesus, as recorded in Luke 6:15 and Acts 1:13. He is sometimes referred to as "James the Less" or "James the Younger" to distinguish him from James, the son of Zebedee. Beyond his inclusion in the lists of the apostles, the Bible provides no further information about his background, ministry, or fate. His father, Alphaeus, is mentioned only in reference to James, and no other details are given about him. As one of the Twelve, James would have been a witness to Jesus' ministry, teachings, death, and resurrection, and would have played a role in the early spread of the gospel message.
