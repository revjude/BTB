Berea, also known as Beroea, was a city in Macedonia, located southwest of Thessalonica. It is mentioned in the book of Acts as one of the places where Paul and Silas preached the gospel during Paul's second missionary journey. After being forced to leave Thessalonica due to opposition from the Jews, Paul and Silas went to Berea \(Acts 17:10\). The Bereans were commended for their open-mindedness and diligence in examining the Scriptures daily to verify the truth of Paul's message \(Acts 17:11\). Many of the Bereans believed, including prominent Greek women and men. However, when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching in Berea, they came and stirred up trouble, forcing Paul to leave the city \(Acts 17:13-14\). Sopater, a believer from Berea, later accompanied Paul on his return trip to Asia \(Acts 20:4\). The church in Berea stands as an example of a community that eagerly received the word of God and diligently studied the Scriptures.
