Woman living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Chloe</span>'s household informed Paul about divisions in the Corinthian church. \([[1Cor.1.11|1Co.1.11]]\)
- A woman living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[1Cor.1.11|1Co.1.11]]; 
- only referred to as Chloe **<big>[[G5514|Χλόη]]</big>**.

Chloe is mentioned in [[1Cor.1.11|1 Corinthians 1:11]] as a believer whose household members reported to Paul about the divisions and quarrels in the church at Corinth. The fact that Paul cites her household as the source of this information suggests that Chloe was a prominent member of the Corinthian church, and her household had direct knowledge of the problems within the congregation. Paul's mention of Chloe's name indicates that she was known to the Corinthians and that her report was credible.
