Athaiah is mentioned in Nehemiah 11 as one of the people who resettled in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. He is described as a descendant of Judah, specifically from the lineage of Perez. The chapter provides a list of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, including leaders, priests, Levites, and people from various tribes who chose to settle in the city. Athaiah's presence in this list suggests that he was a prominent figure among the returnees and played a role in the repopulation and restoration of Jerusalem in the post-exilic period.
