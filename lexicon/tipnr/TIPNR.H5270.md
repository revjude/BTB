Noah was one of the daughters of Zelophehad, a descendant of Manasseh \([[Num.26.33|Numbers 26:33]]\). She had four sisters: Mahlah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah \([[Num.27.1|Numbers 27:1]]\). When their father died without any sons, the daughters of Zelophehad approached Moses and Eleazar the priest, requesting to receive an inheritance among their father's relatives \([[Num.27.1|Numbers 27:1]]-4\). God instructed Moses to grant their request, establishing a legal precedent for daughters to inherit property when there were no sons \(Numbers 27:5-11\). As a result, Noah and her sisters were given an inheritance among the clans of Manasseh \([[Josh.17.3|Joshua 17:3]]-6\).
