- A woman from the tribe of Manasseh living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Num.26.33|Num.26.33]]; 
- only referred to as Noah<[[H5270]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>\); 
-  daughter of Zelophehad<[[H6765]]>; 
- a sister of Mahlah<[[H4244G]]>, Hoglah<[[H2295]]>, Milcah<[[H4435H]]> and Tirzah<[[H8656G]]>.

Noah was one of the daughters of Zelophehad, a descendant of Manasseh \([[Num.26.33|Numbers 26:33]]\). She had four sisters: Mahlah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah \([[Num.27.1|Numbers 27:1]]\). When their father died without any sons, the daughters of Zelophehad approached Moses and Eleazar the priest, requesting to receive an inheritance among their father's relatives \([[Num.27.1|Numbers 27:1]]-4\). God instructed Moses to grant their request, establishing a legal precedent for daughters to inherit property when there were no sons \(Numbers 27:5-11\). As a result, Noah and her sisters were given an inheritance among the clans of Manasseh \([[Josh.17.3|Joshua 17:3]]-6\).
