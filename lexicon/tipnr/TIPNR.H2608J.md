Hananiah is mentioned in [[Neh.12.12|Nehemiah 12:12]] as one of the priests who served during the high priesthood of Joiakim. Joiakim was the son of Jeshua, the high priest who had returned from the Babylonian exile with Zerubbabel. The list in Nehemiah 12 records the heads of the priestly families during the time of Joiakim and his successor, Eliashib. Hananiah is listed among these priestly leaders, indicating his role and responsibility within the temple service. The priests were responsible for conducting religious ceremonies, offering sacrifices, and teaching the law to the people. The mention of Hananiah in this context highlights the continuity of the priestly lineage and the importance of their service in the post-exilic temple.
