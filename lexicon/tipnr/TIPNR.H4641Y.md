Maaseiah was a false prophet who, along with Ahab, prophesied lies to the Jewish exiles in Babylon \([[Jer.29.21|Jer.29.21]]\). In a letter sent by the prophet Jeremiah to the exiles, he warned them about the false prophecies of Ahab and Maaseiah, who were leading the people astray \(Jer.29.20-23\). Jeremiah prophesied that these false prophets would be punished by God, and they would be killed by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon \([[Jer.29.21|Jer.29.21]]\). The presence of false prophets like Maaseiah among the exiles demonstrates the spiritual challenges faced by the Jewish community during the Babylonian captivity.
