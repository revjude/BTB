Shallum, mentioned in [[Jer.35.4|Jeremiah 35:4]], was the father of Maaseiah, who served as a keeper of the threshold during the time of the prophet Jeremiah. The text identifies Maaseiah as "the son of Shallum, the son of Kol-hozeh," indicating Shallum's lineage. The keepers of the threshold were Levitical officials responsible for guarding the entrance to the temple and maintaining order within its precincts. Jeremiah's interaction with the Rechabites, a nomadic tribe known for their commitment to their ancestor's commands, took place in a chamber near the room of the keepers of the threshold. This suggests that Maaseiah, as a keeper of the threshold and the son of Shallum, may have had some connection to or responsibility for this chamber.
