Assos was a seaport located in the region of Mysia, in the western part of Asia Minor. It is mentioned in the New Testament in connection with Paul's third missionary journey. 

According to Acts 20:13-14, Paul's companions sailed from Troas to Assos, while Paul himself traveled by land. The plan was for Paul to meet them in Assos and join them on the ship. After meeting up in Assos, they sailed together to Mitylene. 

The reason for Paul's decision to travel by land to Assos is not explicitly stated in the text. Some scholars suggest that Paul may have wanted to visit friends or churches along the way, or that he needed time alone for prayer and reflection. 

Assos was situated on the Aegean coast, about 20 miles \(32 km\) south of Troas. It was known for its strong walls, which were built from the local volcanic rock. The city also had a significant harbor and was an important trade center in the region. 

Apart from this brief mention in Acts, Assos does not play a significant role in the New Testament narrative. However, its inclusion in the account of Paul's journey provides a glimpse into the geographical and maritime context of the apostle's travels and the early spread of Christianity in Asia Minor.
