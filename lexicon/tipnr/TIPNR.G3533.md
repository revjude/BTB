Nicopolis was a city in the Roman province of Epirus, located on the western coast of Greece. It is mentioned in the New Testament in Paul's letter to Titus \([[Titus.3.12|Titus 3:12]]\). In this letter, Paul instructs Titus to meet him in Nicopolis, as he had decided to spend the winter there. The city was founded by Octavian \(later Emperor Augustus\) to commemorate his victory over Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. Nicopolis became an important center of trade and culture in the region. Paul's mention of Nicopolis suggests that he may have planned to use the city as a base for missionary work in the surrounding area.
