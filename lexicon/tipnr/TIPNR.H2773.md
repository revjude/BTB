Horonaim was a city in Moab that is mentioned in the context of prophetic judgments against Moab \([[Isa.15.5|Isaiah 15:5]]; [[Jer.48.3|Jeremiah 48:3]], 5, 34\). The name Horonaim means "two caves" or "double cave." In Isaiah's oracle, the people of Moab are described as fleeing to Zoar and Horonaim, crying out in distress. Jeremiah's prophecy portrays the impending destruction of Moab, with the sound of crying from Horonaim and the anguish of its inhabitants. These prophecies indicate that Horonaim was a significant city in Moab, but its exact location is unknown.
