The genealogy in 1 Chronicles traces the lineage of Saul and his family, demonstrating the continuity of his descendants even after his death and the transfer of the kingship to David. Binea's inclusion in this record highlights the importance of family lineage and the preservation of ancestral records, even for those who were not part of the royal line of David.
