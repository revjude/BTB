Nehelam is mentioned in the book of Jeremiah as the hometown of Shemaiah, a false prophet living among the exiles in Babylon \([[Jer.29.24|Jeremiah 29:24]],31-32\). Shemaiah sent letters to the people and priests in Jerusalem, urging them to oppose the prophet Jeremiah. He falsely prophesied of a quick return from exile. Jeremiah pronounced judgment on Shemaiah, declaring that he would have no descendants and would not see the good that God would do for His people. The exact location of Nehelam is unknown, but it was likely a village in Babylonia where some of the Jewish exiles settled.
