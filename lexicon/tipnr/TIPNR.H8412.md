Tadmor, also known as Tamar, was a city built by King Solomon in the wilderness. It is mentioned in [[1Kgs.9.18|1 Kings 9:18]] and [[2Chr.8.4|2 Chronicles 8:4]]. The name "Tadmor" is derived from the Semitic word for "palm tree," while "Tamar" means "date palm." The city's location in the wilderness suggests that it was situated in an oasis, possibly to serve as a trade center or a fortified outpost. Many scholars identify Tadmor with the later city of Palmyra, a prominent trading hub in the Syrian Desert during the Roman period. However, this identification remains uncertain. The construction of Tadmor demonstrates Solomon's efforts to expand his kingdom and control trade routes.
