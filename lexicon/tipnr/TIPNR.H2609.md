Hanes is an Egyptian city mentioned briefly in the book of Isaiah. In a prophecy concerning Judah's futile reliance on Egypt for protection against the Assyrian threat, Isaiah declares that Judah's princes were at Zoan, and their envoys had arrived at Hanes \([[Isa.30.4|Isaiah 30:4]]\). 

The exact location of Hanes is uncertain, but it is believed to be situated in ancient Egypt, possibly in the Nile Delta region. Some scholars identify it with the city of Heracleopolis Magna, known as "Hnen-nesut" in ancient Egyptian texts, which was located near the entrance of the Faiyum region. 

Isaiah's prophecy condemns Judah's political alliance with Egypt, portraying it as a useless and shameful endeavor. The mention of Hanes, along with Zoan \(Tanis\), another Egyptian city, highlights the extent of Judah's diplomatic efforts to secure Egypt's support against the impending Assyrian invasion. 

Apart from this single reference in Isaiah, Hanes is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. Its inclusion in the prophecy serves to underscore the futility of Judah's reliance on human alliances, particularly with Egypt, instead of trusting in God for protection and deliverance.
