- A man living before Israel's Monarchy, first mentioned at [[Judg.1.5|Jdg.1.5]]; 
- only referred to as Adoni-bezek **<big>[[H0137|אֲדֹנִי־בֶזֶק]]</big>**.

Adoni-bezek was a Canaanite king mentioned in [[Judg.1.5|Judges 1:5]]-7. He ruled over the city of Bezek, which was located in the territory allocated to the tribe of Judah after the Israelites entered the Promised Land. 

According to the account in Judges, the men of Judah and Simeon fought against Adoni-bezek and defeated him. During the battle, Adoni-bezek fled, but he was pursued, caught, and captured by the Israelites. 

As punishment for his cruelty, the Israelites cut off Adoni-bezek's thumbs and big toes. This was an act of retribution, as Adoni-bezek himself confessed that he had done the same to seventy other kings who had gathered scraps under his table. The seventy kings Adoni-bezek mutilated likely represented the extent of his power and dominion over the surrounding areas. 

Adoni-bezek acknowledged the justice of his punishment, stating, "As I have done, so God has repaid me" \([[Judg.1.7|Judges 1:7]]\). This statement reflects the biblical principle of reaping what one sows and the concept of divine retribution for evil deeds. 

After his capture and mutilation, Adoni-bezek was brought to Jerusalem, where he died. The defeat of Adoni-bezek was part of the larger conquest of Canaan by the Israelites under the leadership of Joshua and the subsequent judges.
