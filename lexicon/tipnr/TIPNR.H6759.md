Zalmunna was one of the two Midianite kings, along with Zebah, who oppressed Israel during the time of the judges. The Midianites, in alliance with the Amalekites and other eastern peoples, regularly raided Israel and destroyed their crops. God raised up Gideon to deliver Israel from the Midianites. After a decisive battle, Gideon pursued the fleeing Midianite army and captured Zalmunna and Zebah. Gideon questioned them about the men they had killed at Tabor, and upon learning that they were his brothers, he executed Zalmunna and Zebah. The defeat of these Midianite kings brought about a period of peace for Israel. The psalmist later refers to Zalmunna and Zebah as examples of God's enemies who were defeated and destroyed.
