Asnah was the head of a family of temple servants, known as the Nethinim, who returned to Jerusalem from Babylonian captivity, as recorded in the book of Ezra. The Nethinim were a group of people assigned to assist the Levites in the maintenance and service of the temple. Asnah's family is mentioned among the list of returnees who accompanied Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, back to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple. This list emphasizes the importance of restoring temple worship and the role of the Nethinim in supporting the Levites in their sacred duties.
