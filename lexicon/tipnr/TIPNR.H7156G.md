Kiriathaim, also referred to as Kerioth or "cities," was a city in Moab, east of the Dead Sea. It is first mentioned in [[Num.32.37|Numbers 32:37]] as one of the cities rebuilt by the Reubenites after the conquest of the region. [[Josh.13.19|Joshua 13:19]] confirms that Kiriathaim was allotted to the tribe of Reuben as part of their inheritance. However, the city later appears to have reverted to Moabite control, as the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel speak of God's judgment against Moab, specifically mentioning Kiriathaim \([[Jer.48.1|Jeremiah 48:1]], 23; [[Ezek.25.9|Ezekiel 25:9]]\). The name "Kiriathaim" means "double city" or "two cities," possibly indicating that it consisted of two parts or was a significant city in the region. The exact location of Kiriathaim is uncertain, but it is believed to be near the modern-day town of Quraiyat in Jordan.
