Jehudi was an official during the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah. He was the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi. When Baruch, Jeremiah's scribe, read the prophet's scroll in the temple, the officials sent Jehudi to summon Baruch and have him bring the scroll. Jehudi then read the scroll to the officials, who decided to report its contents to the king. Jehudi was then sent to read the scroll to King Jehoiakim. As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king cut off the portion with a scribe's knife and threw it into the fire until the entire scroll was burned. Despite the warnings in the scroll, neither the king nor his officials showed any fear or repentance.
