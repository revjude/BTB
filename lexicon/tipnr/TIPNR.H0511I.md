Elkanah is mentioned in the genealogies of the Levites as an ancestor of the prophet Samuel \([[1Chr.6.25|1Ch.6.25]],36\). He appears in the lineage traced from Kohath, the son of Levi, to Samuel and his descendants. This Elkanah is different from the Elkanah who was the father of Samuel, as the genealogy spans several generations. The mention of Elkanah in these passages serves to establish the Levitical lineage of Samuel and his family, highlighting their role in the priesthood and temple service.
