Mattaniah was a Levite who lived during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. When Hezekiah initiated a reformation to restore proper worship in Judah, he ordered the cleansing and consecration of the temple, which had been neglected and defiled during the reign of his father, Ahaz. Mattaniah was among the Levites who participated in this cleansing process, removing the unclean items from the temple and preparing it for proper worship \([[2Chr.29.13|2 Chronicles 29:13]]\). This event marked a significant turning point in Judah's spiritual life, as Hezekiah sought to lead the nation back to the Lord.
