Shelumiel was the son of Zurishaddai and the leader of the tribe of Simeon during the Israelites' wilderness wanderings. In the census taken in the wilderness of Sinai, Shelumiel was the one who stood with Moses and Aaron to number the Simeonites \([[Num.1.6|Numbers 1:6]]\). When the Israelites camped in the wilderness, Shelumiel and the Simeonites were positioned on the south side of the tabernacle, alongside the tribes of Reuben and Gad \([[Num.2.12|Numbers 2:12]]\). 

Shelumiel also had a prominent role in the dedication of the altar. On the fifth day of the dedication, he brought his offering on behalf of the tribe of Simeon, which included various silver and gold utensils and sacrificial animals \([[Num.7.36|Numbers 7:36]],41\). When the Israelites set out from Mount Sinai, Shelumiel led the tribe of Simeon in the second division of the marching order, following the tabernacle \([[Num.10.19|Numbers 10:19]]\).
