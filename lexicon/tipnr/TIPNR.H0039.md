Abimael is mentioned in the genealogies of Genesis 10 and 1 Chronicles 1 as one of the sons of Joktan, a descendant of Shem, the son of Noah \([[Gen.10.28|Genesis 10:28]]; [[1Chr.1.22|1 Chronicles 1:22]]\). Joktan and his descendants, including Abimael, are listed as part of the Table of Nations, which records the spread of Noah's descendants after the Flood. 

The descendants of Joktan are believed to have settled in the southern regions of the Arabian Peninsula. However, no further information is provided about Abimael or his specific role in the biblical narrative. His mention in the genealogies serves to trace the lineage of the Semitic peoples and to demonstrate the fulfillment of God's promise to Noah that his descendants would spread throughout the earth after the Flood \(Genesis 9:1,7\).
