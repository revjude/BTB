Thyatira was a city in the Roman province of Asia Minor \(modern-day Turkey\), located in the Lycus Valley. It was known for its thriving dyeing industry, particularly in the production of purple cloth. Lydia, a seller of purple goods and a worshiper of God, was from Thyatira. She encountered the apostle Paul in Philippi and became a convert to Christianity \(Acts 16:14-15\). Thyatira is also mentioned as one of the seven churches addressed in the Book of Revelation \(Rev. 1:11\). In the letter to the church in Thyatira, the risen Christ commends the believers for their love, faith, service, and patient endurance \(Rev. 2:18-19\). However, he also rebukes them for tolerating a false prophetess, symbolically referred to as "Jezebel," who promoted sexual immorality and idolatry \(Rev. 2:20-23\). The faithful in Thyatira are encouraged to hold fast until Christ's return, with the promise of authority over the nations for those who overcome \(Rev. 2:24-28\).
