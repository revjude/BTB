Hilkiah was the high priest during the reign of King Josiah of Judah \(2 Kings 22-23, 2 Chronicles 34-35\). He is most notable for his discovery of the Book of the Law in the temple, which led to a significant religious reform and renewal in Judah. 

In the 18th year of Josiah's reign, Hilkiah was involved in the repair and restoration of the temple. During this process, he found the Book of the Law, which had been lost or neglected for some time \(2 Kings 22:8, [[2Chr.34.14|2 Chronicles 34:14]]\). Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan the scribe, who then brought it to King Josiah. 

Upon hearing the words of the Law, Josiah was deeply troubled and sought to inquire of the Lord. Hilkiah, along with others, was sent to consult with the prophetess Huldah, who confirmed the authenticity of the book and prophesied about the judgment that would come upon Judah for their disobedience \([[2Kgs.22.12|2 Kings 22:12]]-20, [[2Chr.34.20|2 Chronicles 34:20]]-28\). 

Following this, Josiah initiated a comprehensive religious reform, removing idolatry, destroying pagan shrines, and restoring proper worship according to the Law. Hilkiah played a key role in this process, as he was entrusted with the task of cleansing the temple and overseeing the observance of the Passover \([[2Kgs.23.4|2 Kings 23:4]]-24, 2 Chronicles 35:1-19\). 

Hilkiah is also mentioned in the genealogies of the Levites and priests \(1 Chronicles 6:13, 9:11\).
