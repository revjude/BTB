Man living at the time of Exile and Return

The descendants of <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Jorah</span> \(or Hariph\) were among the exiles who returned to Jerusalem from Babylon.
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.18|Ezr.2.18]]; 
- referred to as Jorah<[[H3139]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יו</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>\), or Hariph<[[H2756H]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ח</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יף</span>\).

Jorah, also called Hariph, was the ancestor of a group of exiles who returned to Jerusalem and Judah from Babylon \([[Ezra.2.18|Ezra 2:18]]; [[Neh.7.24|Nehemiah 7:24]]\). The return likely took place around 538 BC after the Persian king Cyrus issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to their homeland \(Ezra 1:1-4\). In the lists of returning exiles, 112 people are identified as descendants of Jorah/Hariph. The different names may reflect variant spellings or perhaps two related family groups. Apart from being listed among the returning exiles, no other details are provided about Jorah/Hariph or his/their descendants.
