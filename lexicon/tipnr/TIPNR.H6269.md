<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Athach</span>, a town in Judah that received a share of the spoils from David's victory over the Amalekites.
- A location near Hebron\(?\) only  mentioned at [[1Sam.30.30|1Sa.30.30]]; called Athach  **<big>[[H6269|עֲתָךְ]]</big>**

Athach is mentioned briefly in [[1Sam.30.30|1 Samuel 30:30]] as one of the towns in Judah that received a portion of the spoils from David's victory over the Amalekites. After rescuing his men's families and recovering all that the Amalekites had taken, David sent gifts from the plunder to the elders of Judah and to his friends in various towns, including Athach. 

The exact location of Athach is unknown, but it was likely situated in the southern part of Judah, possibly in the Negev region. The context of 1 Samuel 30 suggests that Athach was among the towns where David had previously found support and refuge during his time fleeing from King Saul. 

David's act of sharing the spoils with Athach and other towns demonstrates his gratitude for their assistance and his desire to strengthen his relationships with the people of Judah. This gesture also foreshadows David's future role as king over all Israel, as he sought to build alliances and establish his authority in the region. 

Apart from this single reference in 1 Samuel, no other information about Athach is provided in the Bible. Its mention in the context of David's victory and distribution of plunder highlights the significance of his growing influence and the support he enjoyed among the towns of Judah.
