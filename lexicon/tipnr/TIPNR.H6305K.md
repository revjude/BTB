- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.8.4|Neh.8.4]]; 
- only referred to as Pedaiah **<big>[[H6305|פְּדָיָה]]</big>**.

Pedaiah was a Levite who assisted Ezra when he read the Law to the people in Jerusalem, according to [[Neh.8.4|Nehemiah 8:4]]. After the completion of the wall, the people gathered in the square before the Water Gate to hear Ezra read from the Book of the Law. Ezra stood on a high wooden platform along with several others, including Pedaiah. The presence of Levites like Pedaiah suggests that they had a role in teaching and interpreting the Law to the people.
