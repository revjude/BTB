Pilha is mentioned in [[Neh.10.24|Nehemiah 10:24]] as one of the leaders of the people who signed the covenant during the time of Nehemiah. The covenant was a solemn agreement made by the returned exiles in Jerusalem, in which they pledged to follow the Law of God, given through Moses \(Nehemiah 10:29\). The signatories included priests, Levites, and leaders of the people, demonstrating a collective commitment to obey God's commandments and to support the temple service. Pilha's inclusion in this list suggests that he held a position of responsibility among the people and was a representative of his family or community.
