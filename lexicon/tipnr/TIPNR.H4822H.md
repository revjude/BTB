Meremoth is mentioned in the book of Ezra as one of the Israelites who had married foreign women during the Babylonian exile \([[Ezra.10.36|Ezr.10.36]]\). After Ezra's prayer of confession and call for repentance, the people assembled and agreed to put away their foreign wives and children. Meremoth was among those who had taken foreign wives, but no further information about his specific situation or response to Ezra's call is provided in the biblical text.
