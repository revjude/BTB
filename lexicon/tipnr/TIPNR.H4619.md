Maaz was a son of Ram, who was a descendant of Judah, as recorded in the genealogy found in 1 Chronicles 2 \([[1Chr.2.27|1Ch.2.27]]\). He is mentioned only in this genealogical list and no further information is provided about his life or role in the biblical narrative. The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 2 traces the lineage of Judah, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, and highlights the descendants of Ram, who was a grandson of Judah. Maaz's inclusion in this list serves to establish the continuity of the tribe of Judah and its prominent figures. As with many individuals mentioned in biblical genealogies, the lack of additional details about Maaz suggests that the primary purpose of his mention is to maintain the historical record of the family line.
