Bamoth-baal, meaning "high places of Baal," was a Moabite place of worship mentioned in [[Num.22.41|Numbers 22:41]]. It was one of the locations where Balak, the king of Moab, took the prophet Balaam to curse the Israelites as they were passing through the region. From Bamoth-baal, Balaam could see a portion of the Israelite camp. The place was likely situated on an elevated location, as its name suggests, and was associated with the worship of the Canaanite deity Baal. In [[Josh.13.17|Joshua 13:17]], Bamoth-baal is listed as one of the towns allotted to the tribe of Reuben in the territory east of the Jordan River. [[Num.21.28|Numbers 21:28]] also mentions Bamoth-baal in the context of the Amorite conquest of Moab before the Israelites arrived in the area.
