Ataroth was a town located in the region of Gilead, east of the Jordan River. It is mentioned in the Bible as part of the territory requested by the tribes of Reuben and Gad for their inheritance \([[Num.32.3|Numbers 32:3]]\). Moses granted their request on the condition that they help the other tribes conquer the land west of the Jordan \([[Num.32.3|Numbers 32:3]]3-42\). The town of Ataroth was rebuilt by the tribe of Gad \([[Num.32.3|Numbers 32:3]]4\). Its exact location is uncertain, but it was likely situated near the border between Gad and Reuben's territories. No other details are provided about the town's history, size, or importance. It should not be confused with other places named Ataroth mentioned in the Bible, such as Ataroth-addar on the border of Ephraim \(Joshua 16:5\).
