Tikvah is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.15|Ezra 10:15]] as one of two men who opposed Ezra's reforms concerning Jewish men who had married foreign women. After the Babylonian exile, Ezra led a religious revival among the returned exiles, which included separating from foreign influences. When it was discovered that many Jewish men, including priests and Levites, had married women from other nations, Ezra called for a assembly and urged the people to confess their sin and divorce their foreign wives. The assembly agreed to Ezra's proposal, with the exception of Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, who opposed the plan. Despite their opposition, the reforms were carried out, and the foreign wives were sent away.
