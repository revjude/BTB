Pharaoh living at the time of Divided Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Pharaoh</span>, the Egyptian ruler mentioned among those who would face God's judgment, as prophesied by Jeremiah.
- An Egyptian Pharaoh living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[Jer.25.19|Jer.25.19]]; 
- only referred to as Pharaoh **<big>[[H6547|פַּרְעֹה]]</big>**.

This Pharaoh is mentioned in [[Jer.25.19|Jeremiah 25:19]] as one of the kings and nations that would face God's judgment and be forced to drink the cup of His wrath. The prophecy was given by Jeremiah during the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah, warning of the impending Babylonian invasion and the destruction it would bring upon various nations, including Egypt. 

The specific identity of this Pharaoh is not provided in the text. However, based on the historical context of Jeremiah's prophecy, it is likely that this Pharaoh was either Necho II \(610-595 BC\) or Psamtik II \(595-589 BC\) of the 26th Dynasty of Egypt. These Pharaohs reigned during the time of the Babylonian Empire's rise to power and its eventual conquest of Judah and other nations in the region.
