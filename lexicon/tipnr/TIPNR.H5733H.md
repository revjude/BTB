- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.12.15|Neh.12.15]]; 
- only referred to as Adna **<big>[[H5733|עַדְנָא]]</big>**.

Adna is mentioned in [[Neh.12.15|Nehemiah 12:15]] as one of the priests who served during the high priesthood of Joiakim, the son of Jeshua. Jeshua was the high priest who returned from the Babylonian exile along with Zerubbabel \(Ezra 3:2\). 

The context of Nehemiah 12 is a list of priests and Levites who served in the temple after the return from exile. This list includes the heads of priestly families during the time of Joiakim, as well as the Levites who were responsible for praise and thanksgiving in the temple service. 

Adna's inclusion in this list indicates that he was a prominent priest during the post-exilic period, serving under the leadership of the high priest Joiakim. However, no further details are provided about Adna's specific role, family background, or personal life. 

The mention of Adna in this context highlights the continuity of priestly service in the temple, even after the disruption of the Babylonian exile, and the importance of documenting the lineage and service of the priests and Levites in the restored community.
