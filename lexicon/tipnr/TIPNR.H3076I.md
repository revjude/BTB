Jehohanan is mentioned in [[1Chr.26.3|1 Chronicles 26:3]] as one of the gatekeepers from the Levites during the reign of King David. The gatekeepers were responsible for guarding the entrances to the tabernacle and later the temple. They ensured that only authorized individuals entered the sacred spaces and maintained order and security. Jehohanan is listed among the descendants of Korah who were assigned to this important role. The text does not provide any further details about Jehohanan's specific duties or the duration of his service. However, his inclusion in the list of gatekeepers highlights the significance of this function in the organization of the Levites and the importance of maintaining the sanctity of the tabernacle during David's reign.
