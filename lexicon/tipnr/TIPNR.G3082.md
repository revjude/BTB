Lystra was a city in the region of Lycaonia in Asia Minor \(modern-day Turkey\). Paul and Barnabas fled to Lystra and Derbe when they faced persecution in Iconium \(Acts 14:6\). In Lystra, Paul healed a man who had been lame from birth, which caused the people to believe that Paul and Barnabas were gods \(Acts 14:8-18\). However, Jews from Antioch and Iconium came to Lystra and stirred up the crowd against them, leading to Paul being stoned and left for dead outside the city \(Acts 14:19-20\). Paul later returned to Lystra to strengthen the disciples \(Acts 14:21\). Timothy, a young disciple who accompanied Paul on his missionary journeys, was from Lystra \(Acts 16:1-2\).
