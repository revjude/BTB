Bichri was a Benjamite mentioned as the father of Sheba, a man who led a rebellion against King David \(2 Sa. 20\). After the death of Absalom, David returned to Jerusalem and faced a new challenge when Sheba, son of Bichri, rallied the Israelites against the king, saying, "We have no share in David, no part in Jesse's son!" \(2 Sa. 20:1\). Sheba's rebellion posed a significant threat to David's reign, prompting the king to send his forces, led by Joab, to pursue the rebel. Joab's army besieged the city of Abel-beth-maacah, where Sheba had taken refuge. The city was spared when a wise woman negotiated with Joab and convinced the inhabitants to behead Sheba, thus ending the rebellion \(2 Sa. 20:14-22\). The incident involving Sheba, son of Bichri, highlights the tensions and challenges faced by David in consolidating his rule over all Israel.
