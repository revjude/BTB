- A man living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.36.23|Gen.36.23]]; 
- only referred to as Ebal<[[H5858B]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ֵ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יב</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>\); 
-  son of Shobal<[[H7732G]]>; 
- a brother of Alvan<[[H5935]]>, Manahath<[[H4506B]]>, Shepho<[[H8195]]> and Onam<[[H0208G]]>.

Ebal is mentioned in the genealogies of Esau's family in [[Gen.36.23|Genesis 36:23]] and [[1Chr.1.40|1 Chronicles 1:40]]. He is listed as one of the sons of Shobal, who was a descendant of Seir the Horite. 

The Horites were the original inhabitants of Mount Seir, the region south of the Dead Sea, before Esau's descendants settled there \(Deuteronomy 2:12\). Seir the Horite, Ebal's ancestor, is mentioned as one of the chiefs of the Horites \(Genesis 36:20-21\). 

The inclusion of Ebal and other Horite names in Esau's genealogy suggests that there was intermarriage between Esau's descendants and the Horites. This intermingling of the two groups is further evidenced by the fact that Esau's grandson, Zepho, is also named as a descendant of Seir the Horite \(Genesis 36:11, 15\). 

Apart from being listed in these genealogies, no further information is provided about Ebal or his specific role in the biblical narrative. His mention serves to trace the origins and relationships of the people living in the region of Edom during the time of the patriarchs. 

It is worth noting that there is another Ebal mentioned in the Bible, which is a mountain in the land of Canaan \(Deuteronomy 11:29; 27:4, 13\). However, this mountain is not related to the Ebal mentioned in the genealogies of Esau's family.
