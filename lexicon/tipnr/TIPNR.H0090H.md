Agag was the king of the Amalekites during the reign of King Saul of Israel. God commanded Saul to attack the Amalekites and totally destroy everything, including Agag. Saul defeated the Amalekites but spared Agag and the best of the livestock. The prophet Samuel rebuked Saul for his disobedience and told him that God had rejected him as king. Samuel then summoned Agag and "hewed him in pieces before the Lord." \([[1Sam.15.8|1Sa.15.8]],9,20,32,33\) 

The book of Esther mentions that Haman, the enemy of the Jews, was an Agagite, which suggests he may have been a descendant of Agag the Amalekite. \([[Esth.3.1|Est.3.1]],10; 8.3,5; 9.24\).
