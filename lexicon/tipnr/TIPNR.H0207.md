Ono was a town located in the territory of Benjamin, near Lod \(1 Chr. 8:12; [[Ezra.2.33|Ezra 2:33]]; Neh. 7:37; 11:35\). It is mentioned in the context of the descendants of Benjamin who resettled the area after the Babylonian exile. Ono is also known for its association with Nehemiah's enemies, Sanballat and Geshem, who sought to lure him away from Jerusalem to the plain of Ono, likely to harm him \(Neh. 6:2\). Nehemiah, however, perceived their intentions and refused to meet with them. The exact location of Ono is uncertain, but it was probably situated in the western part of Benjamin, near the border with Judah.
