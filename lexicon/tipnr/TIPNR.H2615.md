Hannathon was a town located on the border of the territory allocated to the tribe of Zebulun during the division of the Promised Land. In the description of Zebulun's boundaries, Hannathon is mentioned as one of the towns marking the eastern border of their territory \([[Josh.19.14|Joshua 19:14]]\). 

The exact location of Hannathon is not specified in the Bible, but based on the description of Zebulun's borders, it is believed to have been situated in the lower Galilee region, likely near the Kishon River. The town's name, Hannathon, is of Hebrew origin and means "favored" or "gracious." 

Apart from its mention in the delineation of Zebulun's territory, no further information about Hannathon is provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in the boundary description suggests that it was a recognized landmark or settlement during the time of the Israelite conquest and settlement of Canaan. 

The tribe of Zebulun, along with the tribes of Issachar and Naphtali, occupied the fertile lands of the Galilee region. They were known for their agricultural and commercial activities, benefiting from the region's rich soil and proximity to trade routes.
