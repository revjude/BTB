Trogyllium is mentioned briefly in Acts 20:15 as a place where the apostle Paul's ship anchored during his journey from Troas to Jerusalem. The town was located on the western coast of Asia Minor \(modern-day Turkey\), near the city of Ephesus. After leaving Troas, Paul and his companions sailed to Assos, where Paul boarded the ship. They then sailed past Mitylene and arrived at Chios. The following day, they crossed over to Samos and stayed at Trogyllium. The next day, they reached Miletus, where Paul summoned the elders of the Ephesian church to give them a farewell address \(Acts 20:17-38\). The mention of Trogyllium in the itinerary of Paul's journey highlights the coastal route he took as he traveled to Jerusalem, stopping at various cities along the way to minister to the churches and strengthen the believers.
