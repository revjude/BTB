Lot was the son of Haran and the nephew of Abraham \([[Gen.11.27|Gen.11.27]],31\). He traveled with Abraham from Ur to Canaan \([[Gen.12.4|Gen.12.4]]-5\). Due to strife between their herdsmen, Lot chose to settle in the plain of Jordan near Sodom \([[Gen.13.1|Gen.13.1]]-13\). Lot was captured when Sodom was invaded, but Abraham rescued him \([[Gen.14.12|Gen.14.12]],16\). Despite the wickedness of Sodom, Lot continued living there \(Gen.19.1\). When God revealed His plan to destroy the city, Abraham pleaded for Lot's safety \(Gen.18.16-33\). Two angels warned Lot to flee Sodom with his family \(Gen.19.1-22\). Lot's wife disobeyed and was turned into a pillar of salt \(Gen.19.26; Lk.17.32\). Lot and his daughters escaped to Zoar and later settled in a cave \([[Gen.19.30|Gen.19.30]]\). Lot's daughters, believing they were the last survivors, got him drunk and slept with him, resulting in the births of Moab and Ammon \(Gen.19.31-38; Ps.83.8\). The New Testament describes Lot as a righteous man distressed by the debauchery of Sodom \([[2Pet.2.7|2Pe.2.7]]\). Jesus used Lot's story as a warning about the suddenness of His return \(Lk.17.28-29\).
