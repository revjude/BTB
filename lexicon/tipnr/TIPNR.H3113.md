Joiakim is mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as a high priest who served during the early Persian period. He was the son of Jeshua, the first high priest to return from the Babylonian exile \(Neh.12.10\). Joiakim is listed in the genealogy of the high priests, affirming his rightful claim to the office. 

According to [[Neh.12.12|Nehemiah 12:12]], during the days of Joiakim, the heads of the priestly families were recorded. This suggests that Joiakim oversaw the organization and administration of the priestly duties and responsibilities. 

Joiakim's high priesthood is also mentioned in [[Neh.12.26|Nehemiah 12:26]], which notes that he served during the time of Nehemiah the governor and Ezra the priest and scribe. This places his tenure in the context of the significant religious and political reforms implemented by Nehemiah and Ezra, which aimed to restore Jewish religious practices and enforce adherence to the Law of Moses. 

As a high priest, Joiakim would have played a crucial role in the spiritual leadership of the Jewish community, ensuring the proper functioning of the temple and its services. His time in office was marked by the ongoing process of rebuilding and strengthening the Jewish faith and identity in the post-exilic period.
