Bajith, meaning "temple" or "house," is mentioned in [[Isa.15.2|Isaiah 15:2]] as part of a prophecy against Moab. In this passage, Isaiah describes the Moabites going up to their temple \(Bajith\) and to their high places to weep and mourn over the impending destruction of their cities, Nebo and Medeba. 

The specific location of Bajith is not provided, but it is likely that it was a significant temple or high place within Moabite territory, east of the Dead Sea. High places were elevated locations where pagan worship and sacrifices were often conducted. 

The prophecy in Isaiah 15 foretells the judgment and devastation that would come upon Moab, a nation that had a history of conflict with Israel. The mention of the Moabites going to Bajith to weep and mourn highlights their distress and the futility of seeking help from their pagan gods in the face of God's judgment.
