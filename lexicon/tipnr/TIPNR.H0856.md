Ethbaal was the king of Sidon, a Phoenician city-state. He was the father of Jezebel, who became the wife of King Ahab of Israel \([[1Kgs.16.31|1 Kings 16:31]]\). Ethbaal's reign is estimated to have been around 878-847 BC. By arranging the marriage of his daughter Jezebel to Ahab, Ethbaal likely sought to strengthen political and economic ties between Sidon and Israel. Jezebel's influence led to the promotion of Baal worship in Israel, which had significant consequences for the nation \(1 Kings 16:32-33\).
