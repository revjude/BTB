- A king in Mesopotamia living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.14.1|Gen.14.1]]; 
- only referred to as Amraphel **<big>[[H0569|אַמְרָפֶל]]</big>**.

Amraphel was the king of Shinar \(Babylonia\) during the time of Abraham. He was one of the four kings who formed an alliance with Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, in a battle against the five kings of the cities of the Plain, including Sodom and Gomorrah. The four kings, led by Chedorlaomer, emerged victorious in this conflict. Some scholars have suggested that Amraphel might be an alternate name for Hammurabi, the famous Babylonian king, but this identification remains uncertain.
