Maacah was the daughter of King Talmai of Geshur, a region located northeast of the Sea of Galilee \([[2Sam.3.3|2Sa.3.3]]; [[1Chr.3.2|1Ch.3.2]]\). She became one of King David's wives and bore him a son named Absalom. Maacah's marriage to David likely served as a political alliance between Israel and Geshur. Absalom, her son, would later flee to Geshur after murdering his half-brother Amnon and remained there for three years \(2Sa.13.37-38\). Although not mentioned by name, Maacah was likely the mother of Tamar, who was raped by her half-brother Amnon \(2Sa.13.1-22\). Maacah's role in the biblical narrative is primarily as the mother of Absalom, whose rebellion against David and subsequent death had a profound impact on the king and his reign \(2Sa.15-18\). Her inclusion in the genealogies of David's family underscores the importance of maternal lineage in the royal line of Judah.
