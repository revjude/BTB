Kir is mentioned in the Bible as a city or region in Mesopotamia, distinct from the Moabite city of the same name. It is associated with the Arameans, who were a Semitic people that inhabited parts of Syria and Mesopotamia. According to [[2Kgs.16.9|2 Kings 16:9]], during the reign of King Ahaz of Judah, the king of Assyria captured Damascus and exiled its inhabitants to Kir. The prophet Amos also mentions that the Arameans originally came from Kir before settling in Damascus \(Amos 9:7\). Some scholars suggest that Kir may be located in the region of Elam, east of Babylonia, based on its association with Elam in [[Isa.22.6|Isaiah 22:6]]. However, the exact location of Kir remains uncertain.
