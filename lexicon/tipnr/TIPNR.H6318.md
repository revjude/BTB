Potiphar was an Egyptian official who served as the captain of the guard in the court of Pharaoh. He is first mentioned in [[Gen.37.36|Genesis 37:36]], where he is identified as the man who purchased Joseph, the son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\), from the Ishmaelite traders who had brought him to Egypt. Potiphar recognized Joseph's abilities and put him in charge of his household, entrusting him with all his possessions \([[Gen.39.1|Genesis 39:1]]-6\). However, Potiphar's wife attempted to seduce Joseph, and when he refused her advances, she falsely accused him of trying to assault her. Believing his wife's accusation, Potiphar had Joseph thrown into prison \(Genesis 39:7-20\). Despite this unjust treatment, God was with Joseph and granted him favor, even in prison. The story of Joseph and Potiphar highlights the themes of integrity, faithfulness, and God's providence in the face of adversity.
