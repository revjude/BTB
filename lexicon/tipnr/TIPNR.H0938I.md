Buz is mentioned in Jeremiah's prophecy as one of the Arabian tribes that would face God's judgment \([[Jer.25.23|Jeremiah 25:23]]\). The tribe of Buz is listed alongside Dedan, Tema, and the kings of the mixed tribes who dwell in the desert. This suggests that Buz was a nomadic or semi-nomadic tribe inhabiting the Arabian desert, possibly in the region east of the Jordan River. 

The name Buz may be derived from Buz, the son of Nahor and nephew of Abraham \(Genesis 22:21\), indicating that the tribe descended from him. However, this connection is not explicitly stated in the Bible. Jeremiah's prophecy implies that the tribe of Buz, along with other Arabian tribes, would suffer the consequences of their sins and face God's judgment. The inclusion of Buz in this prophecy highlights the far-reaching scope of God's judgment and the accountability of all nations before Him.
