Jotbathah was one of the places where the Israelites camped during their wilderness journey after leaving Egypt \([[Num.33.33|Numbers 33:33]]-34\). It is described as a land with brooks of water \(Deuteronomy 10:7\), suggesting that it was a refreshing and well-watered location. The Israelites arrived at Jotbathah after camping at Hor-haggidgad and before moving on to Abronah. The exact location of Jotbathah is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the Sinai Peninsula or the Arabah region, south of the Dead Sea.
