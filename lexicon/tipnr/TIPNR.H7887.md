Shiloh was an important religious center and assembly point for the Israelites during the period of the judges. After the conquest of Canaan, the tabernacle was set up at Shiloh, and it served as the central place of worship for the nation \(Josh. 18:1; 19:51\). It was at Shiloh that the land was allotted to the tribes of Israel \(Josh. 18:8-10; 21:2\) and where the Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh were dismissed to their territories east of the Jordan \(Josh. 22:9, 12\). 

During the time of the judges, Shiloh continued to be a significant religious site. The tabernacle remained at Shiloh throughout this period \(Judg. 18:31\), and annual festivals were held there \(Judg. 21:19, 21\). It was at Shiloh that Hannah prayed for a son and dedicated Samuel to the Lord's service \(1 Sam. 1:3, 9, 24\). The priest Eli and his sons ministered at the tabernacle in Shiloh \(1 Sam. 2:14; 3:21; 4:3, 4, 12\), and the Ark of the Covenant was kept there until it was captured by the Philistines \(1 Sam. 4:3, 4\). 

Shiloh's importance declined after the Ark was taken and the tabernacle was destroyed \(Ps. 78:60; Jer. 7:12, 14; 26:6, 9\). The prophet Ahijah, who prophesied the division of the kingdom, was from Shiloh \(1 Ki. 11:29; 14:2, 4\). The town was eventually destroyed, and its ruins served as a warning against disobedience to God \(Jer. 7:12, 14; 26:6, 9\). 

Shiloh's significance in the biblical narrative lies in its role as a religious and political center during the formative years of Israel's history. Its central location in the hill country of Ephraim made it a convenient meeting place for the tribes and a symbol of their unity under the worship of the Lord.
