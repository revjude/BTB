<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Kelita</span> was a Levite who helped explain the Law to the people and sealed the covenant during the time of Nehemiah.
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Neh.8.7|Neh.8.7]]; 
- only referred to as Kelita<[[H7042G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ק</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יט</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>\).

Kelita is mentioned in [[Neh.8.7|Nehemiah 8:7]] and 10:10 as a Levite who played a significant role in the spiritual renewal of the people during the time of Nehemiah. 

In [[Neh.8.7|Nehemiah 8:7]], Kelita is listed among the Levites who helped Ezra teach the Law to the people. Along with the other Levites, he explained the meaning of the Law to the people, making it clear and giving insight so that they could understand what was being read \([[Neh.8.7|Nehemiah 8:7]]-8\). 

Later, in [[Neh.10.10|Nehemiah 10:10]], Kelita is among the Levites who sealed the covenant made by the people to follow the Law of God. This covenant included commitments to avoid intermarriage with the pagan peoples, to observe the Sabbath, to support the temple service, and to obey the commandments of God \(Nehemiah 10:28-39\). 

Kelita's involvement in teaching the Law and sealing the covenant highlights his role as a Levite in the spiritual instruction and leadership of the people during the post-exilic period. 

Apart from these two mentions in Nehemiah, no other information is provided about Kelita's background or specific responsibilities.
