Ulam is mentioned in [[1Chr.8.39|1 Chronicles 8:39]]-40 as a descendant of Benjamin. He was the firstborn son of Eleasah \(or 'Eshek'\), who was a descendant of Saul, the first king of Israel. Ulam is noted for his numerous descendants, which included 150 sons and grandsons. His descendants were known for their skill in archery, as they are described as "mighty men of valor, archers." The large number of Ulam's descendants and their military prowess suggest that he and his family played a significant role in the tribe of Benjamin during their time. The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 8 traces the lineage of Saul and highlights the prominence of certain individuals within the tribe of Benjamin.
