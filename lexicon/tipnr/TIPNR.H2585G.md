- A man living at the time before the Flood, first mentioned at Gen.4.17; 
- only referred to as Enoch **<big>[[H2585|חֲנוֹךְ]]</big>**; 
- a son of Cain **<big>[[H7014|קַיִן]]</big>**; 
-  father of Irad **<big>[[H5897|עִירָד]]</big>**.

Enoch is mentioned in the genealogy of Cain as his son \(Gen.4.17\). He was born after Cain had been banished by God for killing his brother Abel. The text states that Cain built a city and named it after his son Enoch, which is the first mention of a city in the Bible \(Gen.4.17\). The naming of the city after Enoch suggests that Cain had high hopes for his son and wanted to establish a lasting legacy through him. However, no further details are provided about Enoch's life, his role in the city, or his descendants. The genealogy continues with Enoch's son, Irad, but the focus shifts away from Enoch himself \([[Gen.4.18|Gen.4.18]]\). The mention of Enoch in this context serves primarily to highlight the development of civilization and the expansion of human society, even among the descendants of Cain.
