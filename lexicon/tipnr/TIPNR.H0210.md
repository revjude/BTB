Uphaz is mentioned twice in the Bible as a place known for its fine gold. In [[Jer.10.9|Jeremiah 10:9]], the prophet describes the idols of the nations as being adorned with gold from Uphaz and silver from Tarshish, emphasizing the precious materials used in their construction. In [[Dan.10.5|Daniel 10:5]], the prophet Daniel has a vision of a man clothed in linen, whose waist was girded with gold from Uphaz. The use of gold from Uphaz in both passages suggests that it was highly valued and associated with wealth and luxury. The exact location of Uphaz is uncertain, and some scholars believe it may be a variant spelling or a copyist's error for Ophir, another region famous for its gold in the Bible \(1 Kgs. 9:28; 10:11; 22:48; 1 Chr. 29:4; 2 Chr. 8:18; 9:10; Job 22:24; 28:16; Ps. 45:9; Isa. 13:12\). However, others maintain that Uphaz was a distinct place, possibly located in the Arabian Peninsula or the Near East, known for its high-quality gold. Regardless of its exact location, the mention of Uphaz in the Bible underscores the importance and value placed on gold in ancient Near Eastern cultures.
