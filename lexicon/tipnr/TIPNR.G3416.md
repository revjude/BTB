- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[1Chr.1.37|Act.21.16]]; 
- only referred to as Mnason<[[G3416]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Μνάσων</span>\).

Mnason is mentioned in Acts 21:16 as a disciple from Cyprus who hosted the apostle Paul and his companions during their visit to Jerusalem. He is described as an "early disciple," indicating that he had been a follower of Christ for a long time, possibly even from the early days of the church. 

As Paul and his group traveled to Jerusalem, they were accompanied by some disciples from Caesarea who brought them to Mnason's house. This suggests that Mnason was well-known and respected within the Christian community and that his home was a safe and welcoming place for fellow believers. 

Mnason's Cypriot background is significant, as Cyprus was one of the first places where the gospel was preached to non-Jewish people \(Acts 11:19-20\). His presence in Jerusalem and his willingness to host Paul and his companions demonstrate the unity and hospitality that characterized the early church, despite the cultural and geographical diversity of its members. 

Although no further details are provided about Mnason's life or ministry, his brief mention in Acts 21 highlights the importance of hospitality, fellowship, and support within the early Christian community. His actions exemplify the love and care that believers showed for one another as they worked to spread the gospel message throughout the world.
