Man living at the time of the New Testament

Porcius <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Festus</span> succeeded Felix as the Roman governor of Judea and heard Paul's case, ultimately sending him to Rome for trial.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[1Chr.27.26|Act.24.27]]; 
- referred to as Festus<[[G5347]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Φῆστος</span>\), or Porcius<[[G4201]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Πόρκιος</span>\).

Porcius Festus was a Roman procurator \(governor\) of Judea who succeeded Felix around 60 AD \(Acts 24:27\). He is mentioned in the book of Acts in relation to the apostle Paul's ongoing legal case. Upon taking office, Festus was confronted with the charges against Paul that had been left unresolved by Felix \(Acts 25:1-2\). Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favor, asked Paul if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem for trial, but Paul appealed to Caesar, asserting his rights as a Roman citizen \(Acts 25:9-12\). Festus, unsure how to handle the case, consulted with King Agrippa II and his sister Bernice, who came to Caesarea to pay their respects to the new governor \(Acts 25:13-22\). Paul was brought before Festus, Agrippa, and Bernice to present his defense \(Acts 25:23-26:32\). After hearing Paul's testimony, Festus exclaimed that Paul's great learning had driven him insane \(Acts 26:24\). Agrippa, however, believed that Paul could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar \(Acts 26:32\). Festus then sent Paul to Rome for trial, as he had requested \(Acts 27:1\). The account of Festus's involvement in Paul's case illustrates the complexities of the Roman legal system and the challenges faced by early Christians in navigating it.
