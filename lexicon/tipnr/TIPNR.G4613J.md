Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Simon</span> of Cyrene was compelled by Roman soldiers to carry Jesus' cross on the way to his crucifixion.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Matt.27.32|Mat.27.32]]; 
- only referred to as Simon<[[G4613J]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Σίμων</span>\); 
-  father of Alexander<[[G0223G]]>, Rufus<[[G4504G]]>.

Simon of Cyrene is mentioned in [[Matt.27.32|Matthew 27:32]], [[Mark.15.21|Mark 15:21]], and [[Luke.23.26|Luke 23:26]] as the man who was compelled by Roman soldiers to carry Jesus' cross on the way to his crucifixion at Golgotha. Cyrene was a city in modern-day Libya, North Africa, indicating that Simon may have been a visitor to Jerusalem, possibly for the Passover festival. 

The gospels record that as Jesus was being led out of the city to be crucified, he was weakened by the torture and beatings he had endured. The Roman soldiers seized Simon, who was passing by on his way in from the country, and forced him to carry Jesus' cross behind him. 

Mark's gospel provides an additional detail, mentioning that Simon was the father of Alexander and Rufus \([[Mark.15.21|Mark 15:21]]\). This suggests that Simon's sons were known to the early Christian community, possibly as believers themselves. 

Simon's role in carrying Jesus' cross has been seen as a symbolic representation of the Christian call to take up one's cross and follow Christ \(Matthew 16:24; Luke 9:23\). His brief but significant appearance in the gospel narrative has made him a figure of contemplation and veneration in Christian tradition.
