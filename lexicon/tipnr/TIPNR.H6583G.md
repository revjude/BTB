[[1Chr.9.12|1 Chronicles 9:12]] mentions Adaiah son of Jeroham, the son of Pashhur, as one of the priests who settled in Jerusalem. [[Neh.11.12|Nehemiah 11:12]] also lists Adaiah the son of Jeroham, son of Pashhur, among the priests living in Jerusalem. In [[Ezra.10.22|Ezra 10:22]], descendants of Pashhur are named among those who had married foreign women, which was a violation of the Law. The Pashhur family was one of the important priestly clans in the post-exilic community in Judah.
