Tirzah was a Canaanite city that was captured by Joshua during the conquest of Canaan \(Josh. 12:24\). It later became the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel during the reigns of Jeroboam I, Nadab, Baasha, Elah, Zimri, and Omri \(1 Kgs. 14:17; 15:21, 33; 16:6-23\). Tirzah served as the royal residence and administrative center until Omri built Samaria, which then became the new capital \(1 Kgs. 16:23-24\). The city is also mentioned in the Song of Solomon, where the beauty of the Shulammite woman is likened to that of Tirzah \(Song 6:4\). Tirzah's exact location is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the hill country of Samaria, possibly near modern-day Tell el-Far'ah, about 7 miles northeast of Nablus.
