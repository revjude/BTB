Jair the Gileadite is introduced in [[Judg.10.3|Judges 10:3]]-5 as a judge who led Israel for twenty-two years. He came after Tola and was succeeded by Jephthah. Jair had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys and controlled thirty towns in Gilead, which were called Havvoth-jair. This suggests that Jair and his family held significant influence and power in the region. The text does not provide any further details about Jair's leadership or accomplishments during his time as a judge. After his death, Jair was buried in Kamon, a location likely within Gilead.
