Jehoiada was a prominent high priest who served during the reigns of King David and King Solomon. He first appears in [[2Sam.8.18|2 Samuel 8:18]] and 20:23, where he is mentioned alongside David's sons as a priest. In [[2Sam.23.20|2 Samuel 23:20]] and 22, as well as [[1Chr.11.22|1 Chronicles 11:22]] and 24, Jehoiada is described as the father of Benaiah, one of David's mighty men and a commander in his army. 

During the later years of David's reign, when Adonijah attempted to seize the throne, Jehoiada remained loyal to David and supported Solomon's claim to the kingship \([[1Kgs.1.8|1 Kings 1:8]], 26\). He was among the trusted advisors whom David instructed to anoint Solomon as king \([[1Kgs.1.32|1 Kings 1:32]]-40\). After Solomon's accession, Jehoiada continued to serve as a priest \([[1Kgs.4.4|1 Kings 4:4]]\) and was involved in the execution of Adonijah and Joab for their treachery \([[1Kgs.2.25|1 Kings 2:25]]-35, 46\). 

Jehoiada's son Benaiah also held a prominent position as the commander of Solomon's army \([[1Chr.18.17|1 Chronicles 18:17]]; 27:5\). The text suggests that Jehoiada was a influential figure who played a significant role in ensuring a smooth transition of power from David to Solomon and helped maintain the stability of the kingdom during this critical period.
