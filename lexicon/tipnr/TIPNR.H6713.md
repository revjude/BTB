Sahar is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the book of Ezekiel. In a prophecy against Tyre, Ezekiel lists various places that traded with the city, including Damascus, which is said to have traded in the wine of Helbon and white wool from Sahar \(Ezk. 27:18\). No other information is provided about Sahar in the Bible, and its exact location remains unknown. It is possible that Sahar was a region known for its high-quality wool, but this cannot be confirmed from the biblical text alone.
