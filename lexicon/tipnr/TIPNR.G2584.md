Capernaum was a fishing village located on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee. It served as a base for Jesus' ministry in the region and is mentioned frequently in the Gospels. After being rejected in Nazareth, Jesus made Capernaum his home \([[Matt.4.13|Matthew 4:13]]\) and performed many miracles there, including healing a centurion's servant \([[Matt.8.5|Matthew 8:5]]-13\) and Peter's mother-in-law \(Mark 1:29-31\). 

Jesus taught in the synagogue at Capernaum \([[Mark.1.21|Mark 1:21]]; [[John.6.59|John 6:59]]\) and called several of his disciples, such as Peter, Andrew, James, and John, from the village \(Mark 1:16-20\). Despite the numerous miracles and teachings, the people of Capernaum did not repent, leading Jesus to rebuke the city for its unbelief \([[Matt.11.23|Matthew 11:23]]; [[Luke.10.15|Luke 10:15]]\). 

The ruins of ancient Capernaum have been excavated, revealing the remains of a synagogue dating to the 4th or 5th century AD, built on the foundation of an earlier synagogue from the time of Jesus. The site also includes the remains of a house that may have belonged to Peter.
