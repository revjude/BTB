- An Egyptian Pharaoh living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[Jer.37.5|Jer.37.5]]; 
- referred to as Hophra **<big>[[H6547|פַּרְעֹה]]</big>**, or Pharaoh/-hophra \(NIV= Pharaoh Hophra\)  **<big>[[H6548|פַּרְעֹה חׇפְרַע]]</big>** **<big>[[H6547|פַּרְעֹה]]</big>**.

Hophra, also referred to as Pharaoh in the Bible, was the king of Egypt during the time of the prophet Jeremiah and the Babylonian invasion of Judah. He is mentioned in several passages in the books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel. 

When the Babylonians besieged Jerusalem, King Zedekiah of Judah sought help from Hophra, hoping that the Egyptian army would come to their aid \([[Jer.37.5|Jeremiah 37:5]]\). However, the Egyptians' intervention was short-lived, and they withdrew when the Babylonians temporarily lifted the siege to confront them \([[Jer.37.7|Jeremiah 37:7]], 11\). 

The prophet Ezekiel prophesied against Hophra and Egypt, declaring that God would bring judgment upon them for their pride and for failing to provide effective support to Judah \(Ezekiel 29-32\). Ezekiel's prophecies depicted Hophra as a great crocodile in the Nile, symbolizing his power and influence, but also his downfall \([[Ezek.29.3|Ezekiel 29:3]]-5, 32:2\). 

Jeremiah also prophesied that Hophra would be delivered into the hands of his enemies, just as King Zedekiah of Judah was given into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon \([[Jer.44.30|Jeremiah 44:30]]\). 

Historically, Hophra \(also known as Apries\) ruled Egypt from 589 to 570 BC. He was known for his military campaigns and his support of the Phoenician city of Tyre against the Babylonians. However, he faced internal challenges and was eventually overthrown by Amasis II, one of his generals. 

The biblical account of Hophra highlights the political and military dynamics of the time, as well as the prophetic warnings against relying on human alliances instead of trusting in God.
