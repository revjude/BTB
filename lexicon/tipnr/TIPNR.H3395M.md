Jeroham is mentioned in 2 Chronicles as the father of Azariah, one of the commanders who supported the priest Jehoiada in overthrowing Queen Athaliah and installing Joash as the rightful king of Judah. Athaliah had seized power after the death of her son, King Ahaziah, and had ordered the execution of the royal family. However, Joash, the youngest son of Ahaziah, was rescued and hidden by Jehoiada. When Joash was seven years old, Jehoiada gathered support from the commanders, including Azariah son of Jeroham, to overthrow Athaliah and restore the Davidic line to the throne. This event highlights the importance of loyalty to the Davidic dynasty and the role of key individuals in preserving the lineage of David.
