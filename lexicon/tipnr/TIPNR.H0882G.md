Beeri is mentioned in [[Gen.26.34|Genesis 26:34]] as the father of Judith, one of Esau's wives. He is described as a Hittite, indicating that he was not part of the Abrahamic lineage. The context of the passage is the account of Esau's marriages, which caused grief to his parents, Isaac and Rebekah, because the wives were from the local Canaanite population. The mention of Beeri as Judith's father serves to emphasize the foreign nature of Esau's marriages and the potential for cultural and religious conflicts within the family.
