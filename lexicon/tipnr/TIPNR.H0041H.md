Abinadab, also referred to as Ishvi, was one of the sons of King Saul, the first king of Israel \([[1Sam.14.49|1 Samuel 14:49]]; [[1Chr.8.33|1 Chronicles 8:33]]; 9:39\). He was the brother of Jonathan, Malchishua, and Esh-baal \(also known as Ish-bosheth\). 

Abinadab fought alongside his father and brothers in the battle against the Philistines at Mount Gilboa. In this battle, Saul and his sons, including Abinadab, were killed \([[1Sam.31.2|1 Samuel 31:2]]; [[1Chr.10.2|1 Chronicles 10:2]]\). The Philistines found their bodies the following day and fastened Saul's body to the wall of Beth-shan, while the bodies of his sons were taken to Jabesh-gilead and buried there \(1 Samuel 31:8-13\). 

The death of Abinadab and his brothers marked the end of Saul's reign and paved the way for David to become king over Israel.
