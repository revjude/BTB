Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Hanan</span>, a Levite, was among the signatories of the covenant led by Nehemiah to follow God's Law.
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.10.26|Neh.10.26]]; 
- only referred to as Hanan<[[H2605M]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ח</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ן</span>\).

Hanan is mentioned in [[Neh.10.26|Nehemiah 10:26]] as another Levite who signed the covenant led by Nehemiah to follow the Law of God. This Hanan is listed separately from the Hanan mentioned in Nehemiah 10:22, indicating that they were two different individuals. After the completion of the wall of Jerusalem and the public reading of the Law, the people of Israel made a solemn covenant to obey God's commandments and to support the temple service \(Nehemiah 9-10\). The covenant was sealed by the signatures of the leaders, priests, and Levites, including this Hanan. This event demonstrated the commitment of the post-exilic community to God and their determination to live according to His laws.
