Paphos was a city located on the southwestern coast of the island of Cyprus. It served as the capital of the island during the Roman period and was known for its temple dedicated to Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty. In the New Testament, Paphos is mentioned in connection with Paul's first missionary journey \(Acts 13:6-13\). 

When Paul and Barnabas arrived in Paphos, they encountered a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus, who was an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus \(Acts 13:6-7\). The proconsul, an intelligent man, summoned Paul and Barnabas and sought to hear the word of God. However, the sorcerer, also known as Elymas, opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith \(Acts 13:8\). 

Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, rebuked Elymas and temporarily blinded him, demonstrating the power of God \(Acts 13:9-11\). As a result, the proconsul believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord \(Acts 13:12\). After this incident, Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and traveled to Perga in Pamphylia \(Acts 13:13\).
