Michael is briefly mentioned in the genealogy of the Levites in the book of 1 Chronicles, specifically in the lineage of the Merarites \([[1Chr.6.40|1Ch.6.40]]\). He is listed as the son of Baaseiah, who was a descendant of Merari, one of the three main divisions of the Levites. The Merarites were responsible for the tabernacle's framework, pillars, bases, and other structural elements \(Num.3.36\). In the context of 1 Chronicles 6, the focus is on the Levitical musicians appointed by David to serve in the temple worship. Although Michael is not explicitly described as a musician, his inclusion in this genealogy suggests that he may have been part of the Levitical musical tradition or that his descendants played a role in the temple music.
