Chinnereth, Chinneroth, the Sea of Galilee, and the Sea of Tiberias are different names used in the Bible to refer to the largest freshwater lake in Israel. The lake is located in the Jordan Rift Valley, fed by the Jordan River, and is approximately 13 miles \(21 kilometers\) long and 8 miles \(13 kilometers\) wide. 

In the Old Testament, the lake is referred to as the Sea of Chinnereth \([[Num.34.11|Numbers 34:11]]; [[Josh.13.27|Joshua 13:27]]\) or Chinneroth \([[Josh.12.3|Joshua 12:3]]\), likely named after a nearby town. The name "Chinnereth" may be derived from the Hebrew word for "harp," possibly referring to the shape of the lake. 

In the New Testament, the lake is most commonly known as the Sea of Galilee \([[Matt.4.18|Matthew 4:18]]; [[Mark.1.16|Mark 1:16]]; [[John.6.1|John 6:1]]\) and is the setting for many events in Jesus' life and ministry. Jesus called his first disciples, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew, while they were fishing on the Sea of Galilee \([[Matt.4.18|Matthew 4:18]]-22\). He also calmed a storm on the lake \(Mark 4:35-41\), walked on its waters \([[John.6.1|John 6:1]]6-21\), and appeared to his disciples on its shores after his resurrection \([[John.21.1|John 21:1]]-14\). 

The lake is also referred to as the Sea of Tiberias \([[John.6.1|John 6:1]]; 21:1\), named after the city of Tiberias, which was founded on its western shore during the reign of Herod Antipas \(circa 20 CE\). The city was named in honor of the Roman Emperor Tiberius. 

The Sea of Galilee was an important source of livelihood for the people in the region, with fishing being a major industry. Several of Jesus' disciples, including Peter, Andrew, James, and John, were fishermen on the lake \(Luke 5:1-11\). The lake's shores were also dotted with numerous towns and villages, such as Capernaum, Bethsaida, and Magdala, which feature prominently in the Gospels.
