Igdaliah is mentioned in [[Jer.35.4|Jeremiah 35:4]] as a man of God during the time of the prophet Jeremiah. He is described as having a chamber in the upper court of the house of the Lord, near the chamber of the officials. 

In the context of Jeremiah 35, the prophet Jeremiah is instructed by God to bring the Rechabite family into the house of the Lord and offer them wine to drink. The Rechabites were a nomadic tribe known for their commitment to abstaining from wine and living in tents, as commanded by their ancestor Jonadab, son of Rechab. 

Jeremiah brings the Rechabites to the chamber of Igdaliah, which is described as being above the chamber of Maaseiah, the son of Shallum, who was a doorkeeper.
