Eglaim was a city in Moab, east of the Dead Sea. The only biblical mention is in [[Isa.15.8|Isaiah 15:8]], which is part of a prophecy against Moab. Isaiah declared that the "waters of Dimon are full of blood" and the "cry of distress rises from Eglaim." This indicates that Eglaim would face destruction as part of God's judgment on Moab for their pride and contempt toward His people. The exact location of Eglaim is unknown.
