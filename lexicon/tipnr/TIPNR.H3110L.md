Johanan is mentioned in Nehemiah 12 as a high priest who served during the Persian period. In the genealogies of the priests and Levites, Johanan is listed as the son of Joiada and the father of Jaddua \(Neh.12.11\). He is also mentioned in the context of the priests who were recorded as heads of their fathers' houses during the reigns of Darius the Persian, Xerxes, and Artaxerxes \([[Neh.12.22|Neh.12.22]]-23\). 

These genealogical records were important for establishing the legitimacy and continuity of the priesthood after the return from the Babylonian exile. Johanan's inclusion in these lists indicates that he played a significant role in leading the priesthood and maintaining religious order during a crucial period in Jewish history. However, no additional details are provided about his specific actions or achievements as high priest.
