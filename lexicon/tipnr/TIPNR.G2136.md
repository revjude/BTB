- A woman living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Phil.4.2|Php.4.2]]; 
- only referred to as Euodia **<big>[[G2136|Εὐοδία]]</big>**.

Euodia was a Christian woman in the church at Philippi. In his letter to the Philippians, Paul specifically addresses Euodia and another woman named Syntyche, urging them to reconcile and be of the same mind in the Lord \([[Phil.4.2|Philippians 4:2]]\). The fact that Paul mentions them by name and calls them his co-workers suggests that they were prominent members of the church who had labored alongside him in spreading the gospel \(Philippians 4:3\). The disagreement between Euodia and Syntyche was significant enough for Paul to address it directly, emphasizing the importance of unity and harmony within the church.
