Joezer is briefly mentioned in [[1Chr.12.6|1 Chronicles 12:6]] as one of the Benjaminite warriors who joined David at Ziklag while he was seeking refuge from King Saul. He is described as a Korahite, which may indicate that he belonged to the Levitical clan of Korah. Joezer was part of a group of skilled archers and slingers from the tribe of Benjamin who came to support David during this challenging time. The chronicler highlights the bravery and military expertise of these men, noting that they were "armed with bows and were able to shoot arrows or to sling stones right-handed or left-handed" \(1Ch.12.2\). Joezer's presence among David's supporters demonstrates his loyalty to the future king and his belief in David's divine appointment, even while Saul was still in power.
