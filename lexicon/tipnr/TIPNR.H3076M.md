Jehohanan is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.6|Ezra 10:6]] as the son of Eliashib, a priest during the time of Ezra. The passage describes Ezra's response to the issue of intermarriage between the Israelites and the surrounding nations. Upon learning of this problem, Ezra tore his garments, pulled out some of his hair and beard, and sat down in shock. He then went to the chamber of Jehohanan, son of Eliashib, where he spent the night, mourning and fasting because of the unfaithfulness of the exiles. The text does not provide any further details about Jehohanan himself, but the mention of his chamber suggests that he may have held a significant position within the temple or the priesthood. The fact that Ezra chose to spend the night in Jehohanan's chamber may also indicate a close relationship or a shared concern for the spiritual well-being of the community.
