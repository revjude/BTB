<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Ahishar</span> was in charge of King Solomon's palace. \([[1Kgs.4.6|1Ki.4.6]]\)
- A man living at the time of United Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Kgs.4.6|1Ki.4.6]]; 
- only referred to as Ahishar<[[H0301]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>ֲ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ח</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יש</span>ָׁ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>\).

Ahishar is mentioned briefly in the context of King Solomon's administration. He was appointed as the official in charge of Solomon's palace, which was a significant responsibility. \([[1Kgs.4.6|1Ki.4.6]]\) 

The palace overseer would have been responsible for managing the daily operations of the royal household, ensuring that the needs of the king and his court were met, and maintaining the upkeep of the palace itself. This role required a person of trust, efficiency, and organizational skills. 

The fact that Ahishar is mentioned by name suggests that he was a prominent figure in Solomon's court and held a position of importance. However, no further details about his background, his specific duties, or his tenure as palace overseer are provided in the biblical text. 

Ahishar's role is listed among other key officials in Solomon's administration, such as Azariah, who was in charge of the district governors, and Zabud, a priest and the king's friend. \(1Ki.4.5,7\) This context highlights the structure and organization of Solomon's kingdom during his reign.
