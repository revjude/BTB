Aram-naharaim, meaning "Aram of the two rivers," is mentioned in the title of Psalm 60. This region, located in Mesopotamia between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, was the homeland of the Arameans, a Semitic people group. The title of the psalm indicates that David fought against Aram-naharaim, likely referring to a military campaign during his reign. 

The Arameans of this region were among the enemies Israel faced during the time of the united monarchy. David's confrontation with Aram-naharaim demonstrates the ongoing conflicts between Israel and the surrounding nations as the Israelite kingdom expanded and sought to establish its dominance in the region. 

Apart from this single reference in the psalm title, no other details about David's specific battle against Aram-naharaim are provided in the Bible. However, the mention of this region highlights the geographical scope of David's military activities and the challenges he faced as king of Israel.
