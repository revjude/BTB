Prophet living at the time of Divided Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Nahum</span>, identified as the Elkoshite, was a prophet of God who delivered a message of judgment against the Assyrian city of Nineveh.
- A prophet living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[Luke.3.25|Nam.1.1]]; 
- only referred to as Nahum **<big>[[H5151|נַחוּם]]</big>**.

Nahum, whose name means "comfort", was a prophet identified as "the Elkoshite" in the opening verse of his prophecy. He received and recorded a divine vision concerning the judgment of Nineveh, the capital city of Assyria. 

The prophet's hometown of Elkosh has not been definitively located. Some scholars suggest it may have been in the region of Galilee, noting a possible connection to Capernaum \(Kephar-Nahum, meaning "City of Nahum"\). However, others have proposed locations including the modern Alqush in Assyria. 

Nahum's prophecy provided comfort to Judah, as it announced the coming destruction of Nineveh, their oppressor. His message portrayed God as both an avenging warrior against Nineveh and a protector of those who trust in Him. The historical context of his prophecy appears to be during the period when Assyria was a threatening power over Judah.
