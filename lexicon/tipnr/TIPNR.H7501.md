Rephael is briefly mentioned in the book of 1 Chronicles as one of the gatekeepers of the temple during the reign of King David \([[1Chr.26.7|1 Chronicles 26:7]]\). He was a descendant of Obed-Edom, who was a Levite entrusted with the care of the Ark of the Covenant \(1 Chronicles 13:13-14; 26:4-8\). The gatekeepers were responsible for guarding the entrances to the temple and ensuring that only authorized individuals were allowed to enter \(1 Chronicles 9:17-27\). They also had duties related to the maintenance and organization of the temple. The mention of Rephael as a gatekeeper highlights the importance of this role in maintaining the sanctity and security of the temple, which was the center of worship for the Israelites.
