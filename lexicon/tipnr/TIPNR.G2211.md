- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Titus.3.13|Tit.3.13]]; 
- only referred to as Zenas **<big>[[G2211|Ζηνᾶς]]</big>**.

Zenas was a Christian lawyer mentioned by Paul in his letter to Titus. Paul instructs Titus to help Zenas and Apollos on their journey, ensuring that they have everything they need. The fact that Paul refers to Zenas as a lawyer suggests he may have had training in Jewish or Roman law. His association with Apollos, a learned and eloquent teacher, may indicate that Zenas was also involved in teaching or preaching. Paul's commendation of Zenas demonstrates his importance in the early Christian community, although no other details about his life or ministry are provided in the Bible.
