King living at the time of Divided Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Nadab</span>, the son of Jeroboam I, reigned as king of Israel for two years before being assassinated by Baasha.
- A king of Northern Israel, living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Kgs.14.20|1Ki.14.20]]; 
- only referred to as Nadab **<big>[[H5070|נָדָב]]</big>**; 
-  son of Jeroboam **<big>[[H3379|יָרׇבְעָם]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Abijah **<big>[[H0029|אֲבִיָּה]]</big>**.

Nadab was the son of Jeroboam I, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy. He succeeded his father as king and reigned over Israel for two years \([[1Kgs.15.25|1 Kings 15:25]]\). 

Like his father, Nadab did evil in the sight of the Lord, following in the ways of Jeroboam and leading the people of Israel into sin \(1 Kings 15:26\). This likely refers to the continuation of the idolatrous practices instituted by Jeroboam, such as the worship of golden calves at Bethel and Dan \(1 Kings 12:28-33\). 

During Nadab's reign, he went to war against the Philistines and besieged the town of Gibbethon \([[1Kgs.15.27|1 Kings 15:27]]\). While he was there, Baasha, a man from the tribe of Issachar, conspired against him and assassinated him \([[1Kgs.15.27|1 Kings 15:27]]\). Baasha then succeeded Nadab as king of Israel. 

After Nadab's death, Baasha killed all the members of Jeroboam's household, fulfilling the prophecy spoken by Ahijah the Shilonite against Jeroboam's dynasty \(1 Kings 14:10-11; 15:29\). This act was a judgment against the house of Jeroboam for the sins they had committed and the idolatry they had promoted in Israel. 

Nadab's brief reign and his assassination demonstrate the instability and turmoil that characterized the northern kingdom of Israel, as well as the consequences of disobedience to God and the continuation of idolatrous practices.
