- A man living at the time of United Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.1.10|Psa.7.1]]; 
- only referred to as Cush<[[H3568B]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>כ</span>ּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ו</span>ּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ש</span>ׁ\).

Cush, a Benjamite, is mentioned in the title of Psalm 7, which provides the context for David's composition of this psalm. The title states that David sang this song to the Lord concerning the words of Cush, a Benjamite. This suggests that Cush had spoken against David in some manner, possibly through slander, false accusations, or threats. 

The content of Psalm 7 reveals that David faced persecution and opposition, and he sought God's protection and justice against those who attacked him without cause. David affirms his innocence and trusts in God to judge righteously, knowing that God is a righteous judge who feels indignation every day. 

Although no further details are provided about Cush or his specific words against David, the psalm's title and content indicate that Cush's actions prompted David to seek refuge and vindication from the Lord. This incident demonstrates David's reliance on God in the face of adversity and his confidence in God's justice.
