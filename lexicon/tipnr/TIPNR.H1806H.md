- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.24.18|1Ch.24.18]]; 
- only referred to as Delaiah **<big>[[H1806|דְּלָיָה]]</big>**.

Delaiah is mentioned in [[1Chr.24.18|1 Chronicles 24:18]] as a priest who was appointed by King David to oversee the twenty-third division of the priestly order. David, along with Zadok and Ahimelech, organized the priests into twenty-four divisions to ensure a systematic and orderly service in the temple. 

Each division was responsible for serving in the temple for a specific period, and the order was determined by casting lots. Delaiah's division was the twenty-third in the order of service. 

The organization of the priests into divisions allowed for a fair distribution of duties and responsibilities, ensuring that the temple service ran smoothly and efficiently. This system also allowed the priests to balance their temple duties with their other responsibilities, such as teaching the law and ministering to the people. 

Apart from this mention in the context of the priestly divisions, no other details are provided about Delaiah's life or specific role. His inclusion in this list highlights the importance of the priestly order and the organization of the temple service during the reign of King David.
