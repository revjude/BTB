Mattithiah was a Levite who lived during the time of Ezra and Nehemiah, after the Babylonian exile. When Ezra read the Book of the Law to the people in Jerusalem, Mattithiah was one of the Levites who stood beside him on the platform \([[Neh.8.4|Nehemiah 8:4]]\). The Levites were responsible for helping the people understand the Law as it was being read. This event marked a significant moment in the spiritual reformation of the Israelites, as they recommitted themselves to follow God's commandments and covenant.
