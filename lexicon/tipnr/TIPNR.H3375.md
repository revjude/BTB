Yiron is a town mentioned in [[Josh.19.38|Joshua 19:38]] as part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Naphtali during the division of the Promised Land. It is listed among other cities in the region, such as Iron, Migdal El, Horem, and Beth-anath. The exact location of Yiron is unknown, but it was situated within the tribal territory of Naphtali, which was located in the northern part of Canaan, bordering Asher to the west and the Jordan River to the east. No further information about Yiron is provided in the Bible, and the town is not mentioned in any other context. The inclusion of Yiron in the list of Naphtali's cities highlights the thoroughness of the biblical record in documenting the allotment of the land to the tribes of Israel, even when mentioning relatively obscure places.
