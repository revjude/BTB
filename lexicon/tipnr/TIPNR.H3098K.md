Joah, son of Zimmah, a Levite belonging to the Gershonite clan, is mentioned in 2 Chronicles 29:12 as one of the Levites who participated in the cleansing and consecration of the temple during the reign of King Hezekiah. When Hezekiah ascended to the throne, he initiated a reformation to restore proper worship in Judah. As part of this process, he called upon the Levites to purify the temple, which had fallen into disrepair and defilement during the reign of the previous kings. Joah, along with other Levites from various clans, responded to this call and took part in the cleansing and sanctification of the temple, ensuring that it was ready for the proper worship of God.
