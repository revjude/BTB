Michael is mentioned in the book of 2 Chronicles as one of the sons of King Jehoshaphat of Judah \([[2Chr.21.2|2Ch.21.2]]\). He is listed alongside his brothers: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, and Shephatiah. The passage states that Jehoshaphat gave his sons many gifts of silver, gold, and valuable possessions, along with fortified cities in Judah. However, the kingdom was given to Jehoram, Michael's eldest brother, as he was the firstborn \(2Ch.21.3\). No further details about Michael's life, character, or role within the royal family are provided in the biblical text. His mention serves to highlight the sons of Jehoshaphat and the distribution of wealth and responsibility among them. The focus of the narrative then shifts to Jehoram's reign and the challenges he faced as king of Judah.
