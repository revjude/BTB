- A man living at the time of the Patriarchs, first mentioned at [[Gen.10.14|Gen.10.14]]; 
- only referred to as Philistine **<big>[[H6430|פְּלִשְׁתִּי]]</big>**; 
- a son of Casluhim **<big>[[H3695|כַּסְלֻחִים]]</big>**.

The Philistines are mentioned in the genealogies of Genesis 10 and 1 Chronicles 1, which record the descendants of Noah's sons after the flood. In these passages, the Philistines are listed as descendants of Mizraim, the son of Ham \([[Gen.10.14|Genesis 10:14]]; [[1Chr.1.12|1 Chronicles 1:12]]\). This suggests that the Philistines were related to the Egyptians and other Hamitic peoples. The Table of Nations provides a general overview of the geographic distribution and ethnic relationships of the ancient world, but it does not give specific details about the Philistines' history or culture. Throughout the Old Testament, the Philistines are portrayed as one of the main enemies of Israel, occupying the coastal plain of Canaan and engaging in numerous conflicts with the Israelites during the period of the judges and the early monarchy.
