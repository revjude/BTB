Ramah is mentioned in the Bible as a town situated on the border between the territory of the tribe of Asher and the city-state of Tyre \(Josh. 19:29\). It is listed among the towns and cities allocated to Asher during the division of the Promised Land. The exact location of this Ramah is uncertain, but it is believed to have been located in the northern coastal region of Canaan, near the Mediterranean Sea. Its proximity to Tyre, a major Phoenician city known for its maritime trade and wealth, suggests that Ramah may have been influenced by or involved in commercial activities with the Phoenicians. The mention of Ramah in the description of Asher's territory highlights the allocation of specific towns and cities to each of the twelve tribes of Israel, fulfilling God's promise to give them the land of Canaan as an inheritance. Although no further details about this Ramah are provided in the Bible, its inclusion in the list of Asher's towns serves to emphasize the orderly division of the land and the establishment of the tribes in their designated areas.
