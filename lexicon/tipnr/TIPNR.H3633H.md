Calcol is mentioned in [[1Chr.2.6|1 Chronicles 2:6]] as one of the five sons of Zerah, who was a son of Judah. The other sons of Zerah were Zimri, Ethan, Heman, and Dara. This genealogy traces the descendants of Judah, one of the twelve sons of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\), and highlights the family line of David, who would later become king of Israel. Calcol's inclusion in this genealogy demonstrates his connection to the tribe of Judah and his place in the ancestral line of important figures in Israel's history.
