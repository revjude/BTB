- Aaron's adversary from the tribe of Reuben living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Num.16.1|Num.16.1]]; 
- only referred to as Abiram **<big>[[H0048|אֲבִירָם]]</big>**; 
-  son of Eliab **<big>[[H0446|אֱלִיאָב]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Dathan **<big>[[H1885|דָּתָן]]</big>** and Nemuel **<big>[[H5241|נְמוּאֵל]]</big>**.

Abiram was a Reubenite, the son of Eliab, who joined Korah and Dathan in a rebellion against the leadership of Moses and Aaron in the wilderness \([[Num.16.1|Numbers 16:1]]\). When summoned by Moses, Abiram and Dathan refused to come, accusing Moses of failing to bring them into a land flowing with milk and honey and trying to make himself a prince over them \([[Num.16.1|Numbers 16:1]]2-14\). 

In response to the rebellion, Moses proposed a test to demonstrate whom God had chosen. Korah and his followers were to present themselves before the Lord with censers, and God would show who was holy \([[Num.16.1|Numbers 16:1]]6-19\). God warned Moses and Aaron to separate themselves from the rebels so that He could consume them, but Moses interceded for the people \(Numbers 16:20-22\). 

God then commanded the congregation to move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Moses declared that if these men died a natural death, then the Lord had not sent him, but if the earth swallowed them up, then they had rejected the Lord \(Numbers 16:23-30\). As soon as Moses finished speaking, the ground split apart and swallowed up Korah, Dathan, Abiram, their households, and all their possessions \(Numbers 16:31-33; Psalm 106:17\). 

The sons of Korah, however, did not die \(Numbers 26:11\). The rebellion of Abiram and his co-conspirators served as a warning to the Israelites not to challenge God's appointed leaders \(Deuteronomy 11:6\). The New Testament also refers to this incident as an example of God's judgment against those who reject His authority \(Jude 11\).
