People from Ithar\(?\)

The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Ithrites</span> were a clan descended from Kiriath-jearim \([[1Chr.2.53|1Ch.2.53]]\), and two of David's mighty warriors, Ira and Gareb, were Ithrites \(2Sa.23.38; 1Ch.11.40\).
- People from Ithar\(?\), first mentioned at 2Sa.23.38; 
- only referred to as Ithrites<[[H3505]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ת</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>\).

The Ithrites were a clan or family group mentioned in the Bible, descended from the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, a town in Judah \([[1Chr.2.53|1Ch.2.53]]\). Kiriath-jearim was one of the cities allotted to the tribe of Judah \(Jos.15.60\) and was the place where the ark of the covenant was kept for a time before being brought to Jerusalem by David \(1Sa.7.1-2; 2Sa.6.2-4\). 

Two of David's mighty warriors, Ira and Gareb, are identified as Ithrites \(2Sa.23.38; 1Ch.11.40\). These men were part of an elite group of soldiers who served David faithfully and were renowned for their military prowess \(2Sa.23.8-39; 1Ch.11.10-47\). 

The mention of the Ithrites in these passages highlights the importance of family and clan connections in Israelite society and the role that certain groups played in the military and political life of the nation. It also demonstrates the significance of Kiriath-jearim as a town with a rich history and connection to the ark of the covenant.
