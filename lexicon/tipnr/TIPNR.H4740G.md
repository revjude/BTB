The Angle is mentioned in [[2Chr.26.9|2 Chronicles 26:9]] as one of the towers built by King Uzziah of Judah in Jerusalem. The verse states that Uzziah constructed towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, the Valley Gate, and at the Angle, fortifying them. The exact location of the Angle is not specified, but it was likely a strategic point in the city's defensive system, possibly at a bend or corner in the wall. 

King Uzziah, who reigned in the 8th century BC, was known for his military achievements and building projects. The construction of the Angle tower was part of his efforts to strengthen Jerusalem's fortifications. By building towers at key locations, Uzziah aimed to improve the city's security and protect it from potential enemy attacks. 

Apart from this single mention in the context of Uzziah's building activities, no other information about the Angle is provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in the chronicle of Uzziah's reign highlights the king's dedication to enhancing Jerusalem's defenses and his overall success as a ruler.
