Jahzeel, also known as Jahziel, was one of the sons of Naphtali and a grandson of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) \(Gen. 46:24; 1Ch. 7:13\). He is mentioned in the genealogy of Jacob's descendants who went to Egypt during the time of Joseph. In the census taken in the wilderness, Jahzeel is listed as one of the clans of Naphtali \(Num. 26:48\). The Jahzeelites, his descendants, are counted among the clans of Naphtali. 

Apart from these mentions in the genealogies and census, no other details about Jahzeel's life or specific role are provided in the Bible. His inclusion in these lists highlights his place in the lineage of Naphtali and his status as a clan leader within the tribe. The variation in the spelling of his name \(Jahzeel or Jahziel\) occurs in different passages, but both refer to the same individual.
