- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.3.16|Neh.3.16]]; 
- only referred to as Nehemiah **<big>[[H5166|נְחֶמְיָה]]</big>**; 
- a son of Azbuk **<big>[[H5802|עַזְבּוּק]]</big>**.

Nehemiah, the son of Azbuk, is mentioned briefly in [[Neh.3.16|Nehemiah 3:16]] as one of the individuals who participated in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls under the leadership of Nehemiah, the governor of Judah. This event took place in the mid-5th century BC, following the return of the Jews from Babylonian exile. 

According to the text, Nehemiah son of Azbuk was responsible for repairing a specific section of the wall, which was located near the tombs of David, the house of the warriors, and the Water Gate. This suggests that he was a person of some importance or influence within the Jewish community, as he was entrusted with a significant portion of the rebuilding project. 

The fact that Nehemiah son of Azbuk's section of the wall was near the tombs of David also indicates that this area was of particular historical and religious significance to the Jewish people. By repairing this section, Nehemiah son of Azbuk was contributing to the restoration of both the physical and spiritual aspects of Jerusalem. 

Apart from this single mention in [[Neh.3.16|Nehemiah 3:16]], no further information is provided about Nehemiah son of Azbuk's life, family, or role within the community. However, his inclusion in the list of those who participated in the rebuilding of the walls highlights the collective effort and unity of the Jewish people in their task of restoring Jerusalem and their commitment to their faith and heritage.
