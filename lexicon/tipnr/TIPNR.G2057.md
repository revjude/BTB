Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Hermas</span> was a Christian in Rome to whom Paul sent greetings in his letter to the Romans. \(Rom.16.14\)
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at Rom.16.14; 
- referred to as Hermas **<big>[[G2057|Ἑρμᾶς]]</big>**, or Hermes \(=Var, KJV\)  **<big>[[G2057|Ἑρμᾶς]]</big>**.

Hermas is mentioned in the Bible as one of the Christians in Rome to whom Paul sent greetings in his letter to the Romans. He is listed along with several other believers, including Asyncritus, Phlegon, and Hermes \(Rom.16.14\). The fact that Paul specifically mentions Hermas in his greetings suggests that he was a notable member of the Roman Christian community. However, no further information is provided about Hermas' background, conversion, or role in the church. Some scholars have suggested that this Hermas may be the same person as the author of the early Christian work "The Shepherd of Hermas," but this identification is uncertain and not universally accepted. \(Rom.16.14\).
