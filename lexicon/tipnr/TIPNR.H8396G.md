Mount Tabor is a prominent mountain located in the Jezreel Valley of Israel. It is mentioned several times in the Bible, most notably in the account of Deborah and Barak's victory over Sisera and the Canaanite army \(Judg. 4:6-14\). Deborah, a prophetess and judge, summoned Barak to gather troops from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun on Mount Tabor. From there, they descended to fight against Sisera's forces, and with God's help, they achieved a decisive victory. Mount Tabor is also mentioned as a boundary marker for the tribe of Zebulun \(Josh. 19:22\) and is praised for its beauty along with Mount Hermon in Psalm 89:12. The prophet Jeremiah uses Mount Tabor as a symbol of God's power and majesty \(Jer. 46:18\), while Hosea associates it with sites of idolatry and corruption \(Hos. 5:1\).
