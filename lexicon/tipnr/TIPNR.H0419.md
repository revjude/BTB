Man living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Eldad</span> was a prophet who prophesied in the Israelite camp during the time of Moses.
- A man living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Num.11.26|Num.11.26]]; 
- only referred to as Eldad **<big>[[H0419|אֶלְדָּד]]</big>**.

Eldad is mentioned in [[Num.11.26|Numbers 11:26]]-27 as one of the seventy elders chosen by Moses to share the burden of leadership. When the Spirit rested upon the elders, they prophesied. However, Eldad and another man named Medad were not with the others at the tent of meeting but prophesied in the camp. Joshua urged Moses to stop them, but Moses replied that he wished all the Lord's people were prophets. This incident highlights the unexpected and widespread nature of the Spirit's work.
