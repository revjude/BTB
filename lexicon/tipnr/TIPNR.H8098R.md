Shemaiah was a Levite who participated in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's wall under the leadership of Nehemiah. According to [[Neh.3.29|Nehemiah 3:29]], Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah \(or 'Shechaniah'\), the keeper of the East Gate, made repairs to a section of the wall next to his house. This was part of a larger effort to restore the walls and gates of Jerusalem, which had been damaged during the Babylonian conquest. Shemaiah's contribution, along with that of many others, helped to fortify the city and provide a sense of security for the Jewish community.
