<small>*Male • Egyptian magician who opposed Moses*</small>

Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Jambres</span> was an Egyptian magician who, along with Jannes, opposed Moses.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[2Tim.3.8|2Ti.3.8]]; 
- only referred to as Jambres **<big>[[G2387|Ἰαμβρῆς]]</big>**.

Jambres is mentioned in [[2Tim.3.8|2 Timothy 3:8]] as one of two Egyptian magicians who opposed Moses during the events of the Exodus. Along with Jannes, Jambres is said to have resisted Moses, likely referring to the magicians' attempts to duplicate the miracles performed by Moses and Aaron before Pharaoh \(Exodus 7-8\). Although not named in the Old Testament, Jewish tradition identified these two magicians and passed down their names. Paul's use of these names in 2 Timothy suggests that the story of Jannes and Jambres was well-known among his audience and served as an example of those who resist the truth. The text does not provide any further details about Jambres' life or the extent of his opposition to Moses.
