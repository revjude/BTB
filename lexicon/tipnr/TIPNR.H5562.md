- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[Jer.39.3|Jer.39.3]];

Samgar is mentioned in [[Jer.39.3|Jeremiah 39:3]] as one of the Babylonian officials who were present at the fall of Jerusalem during the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah. The context of this passage describes the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem, which occurred after a prolonged siege \(Jeremiah 39:1-2\). When the city wall was breached, the Babylonian officials entered the city and took up positions at the Middle Gate \([[Jer.39.3|Jeremiah 39:3]]\). Samgar is listed among these officials, along with Nergal-sharezer of Samgar, Nebo-sarsekim the Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag, and other officials of the king of Babylon. The exact role or position of Samgar within the Babylonian hierarchy is not specified in the text. However, his presence among the officials at the fall of Jerusalem indicates that he was a person of some importance in the Babylonian administration. The fall of Jerusalem and the subsequent exile of the Judahites to Babylon was a significant event in the history of Israel, marking the end of the Davidic monarchy and the beginning of the Babylonian captivity, which lasted for 70 years \(Jeremiah 25:11-12\).
