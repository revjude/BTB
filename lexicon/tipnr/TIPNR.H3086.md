Jehoaddan is mentioned in [[2Chr.25.1|2 Chronicles 25:1]] and [[2Kgs.14.2|2 Kings 14:2]] as the mother of King Amaziah of Judah. She was from Jerusalem, but no further information is provided about her background or family. Jehoaddan's son, Amaziah, became king at the age of 25 and reigned for 29 years in Jerusalem. The text does not give any details about Jehoaddan's role in her son's life or reign, but her mention in the context of Amaziah's accession to the throne suggests that the mother of the king was considered a significant figure. The fact that her place of origin, Jerusalem, is specifically mentioned may also indicate that she was from an influential family or had connections to the royal court.
