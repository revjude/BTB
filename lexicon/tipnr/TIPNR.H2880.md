Tibhath is mentioned in [[1Chr.18.8|1 Chronicles 18:8]] as one of the cities from which King David took a large amount of bronze \(copper or brass\) after defeating Hadadezer, king of Zobah. The bronze was later used by Solomon in the construction of the Temple, specifically for making the bronze Sea, the pillars, and various bronze articles \(1 Chr. 18:8\). The parallel passage in 2 Samuel 8:8 refers to the city as "Betah." The exact location of Tibhath is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the region of Zobah, a kingdom to the north of Israel, in the area of modern-day Syria. The acquisition of bronze from Tibhath demonstrates David's military successes and his preparation for the future construction of the Temple, a task that would be completed by his son Solomon.
