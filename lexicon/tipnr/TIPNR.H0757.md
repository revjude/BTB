The Archites were a people group mentioned in the Old Testament, primarily in connection with the region near Bethel, a city located on the border between the territories of Ephraim and Benjamin. In [[Josh.16.2|Joshua 16:2]], the boundary of Ephraim's territory is described as extending from Bethel to Luz and going down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah, reaching to Jericho and the Jordan River. This suggests that the Archites inhabited a region in the vicinity of Bethel. 

The most prominent Archite mentioned in the Bible is Hushai, who is described as King David's friend and advisor. During Absalom's rebellion against David, Hushai remained loyal to the king and acted as a spy in Absalom's court. He successfully countered the advice of Ahithophel, Absalom's counselor, and played a crucial role in helping David regain the throne \(2 Samuel 15-17\). Hushai's loyalty and wisdom were highly valued by David, as evidenced by his inclusion among the king's chief officials \([[1Chr.27.33|1 Chronicles 27:33]]\). 

Apart from these mentions, little is known about the Archites as a people group. Their association with the region near Bethel and the prominence of Hushai in David's court suggest that they may have been a significant clan or tribe within Israel during the time of the United Monarchy.
