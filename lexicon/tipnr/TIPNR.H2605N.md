Hanan, the son of Zaccur, is mentioned in [[Neh.13.13|Nehemiah 13:13]] as one of the treasurers appointed by Nehemiah to oversee the storehouses. Nehemiah assigned four reliable men, including Hanan, to distribute the portions due to the priests and Levites from the tithes and offerings collected in the storehouses. This appointment was made to ensure the fair distribution of resources and to support the temple service. Nehemiah's choice of Hanan and the other treasurers was based on their trustworthiness and integrity. The appointment of dedicated individuals like Hanan helped maintain the proper functioning of the temple and the support of its personnel in the post-exilic period.
