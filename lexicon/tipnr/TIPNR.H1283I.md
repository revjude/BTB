Beriah was a leader from the tribe of Benjamin who, along with his brother Shema, drove out the inhabitants of Gath \(1 Ch. 8:13\). They were the heads of the families living in Aijalon, a city within the territory of Benjamin. This event likely occurred during the period of the judges or the early monarchy, when the Israelites were still establishing their presence in Canaan and facing resistance from the local populations. Beriah and Shema's actions demonstrate the military prowess and leadership of the Benjamites in defending and expanding their territory.
