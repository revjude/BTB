Ehud is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.7.10|1 Chronicles 7:10]] as one of the sons of Bilhan, a descendant of Benjamin. He is listed among the heads of families in the tribe of Benjamin. 

The name Ehud means "united" or "strong" in Hebrew. Apart from this genealogical reference, no other details about this particular Ehud are provided in the Bible. 

It is important to note that this Ehud is not the same person as the judge Ehud, son of Gera, who is mentioned in Judges 3:12-30. The judge Ehud delivered Israel from the oppression of the Moabites, but he is not the same individual as the Ehud mentioned in the genealogy of Benjamin in 1 Chronicles 7.
