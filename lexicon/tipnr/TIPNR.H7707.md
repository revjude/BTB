Shedeur was the father of Elizur, a prominent leader from the tribe of Reuben. Elizur was chosen as the leader of the Reubenites in the census and organization of Israel in the wilderness \([[Num.1.5|Numbers 1:5]]\). He was in charge of the camp of Reuben, which was located on the south side of the tabernacle \([[Num.2.10|Numbers 2:10]]\). 

Elizur represented Reuben when the leaders brought offerings for the dedication of the altar. He brought his offering on the fourth day \([[Num.7.30|Numbers 7:30]],35\). When the Israelites set out from Mount Sinai, Elizur led the tribe of Reuben, along with the Simeonites and the Gadites, as the second group in the order of march \([[Num.10.18|Numbers 10:18]]\). Shedeur is mentioned only in reference to his son Elizur and is not recorded as having any other role or significance himself.
