- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[John.3.1|Jhn.3.1]]; 
- only referred to as Nicodemus **<big>[[G3530|Νικόδημος]]</big>**.

Nicodemus was a Pharisee and a member of the Jewish ruling council, the Sanhedrin \([[John.3.1|John 3:1]]\). He came to Jesus at night, likely to avoid being seen, and engaged in a discussion about the need to be born again to enter the kingdom of God \([[John.3.1|John 3:1]]-21\). Later, Nicodemus defended Jesus before the Sanhedrin, reminding them that the law required a person to be heard before being judged \([[John.7.50|John 7:50]]-51\). After the crucifixion, Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes to anoint Jesus' body for burial, demonstrating his devotion to Jesus \([[John.19.39|John 19:39]]-40\). Though initially coming to Jesus in secret, Nicodemus grew to be a follower of Christ.
