Hanamel was the cousin of the prophet Jeremiah and is mentioned in the context of Jeremiah's purchase of a field during the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem \([[Jer.32.7|Jeremiah 32:7]]-12\). While Jeremiah was imprisoned in the court of the guard, the word of the Lord came to him, revealing that Hanamel would come and offer to sell him a field in Anathoth, Jeremiah's hometown \([[Jer.32.7|Jeremiah 32:7]]-8\). As prophesied, Hanamel visited Jeremiah and offered to sell him the field, which was Jeremiah's right to redeem as a close relative \([[Jer.32.8|Jeremiah 32:8]]\). Jeremiah purchased the field, weighed out the money, signed and sealed the deed, and had it witnessed \([[Jer.32.9|Jeremiah 32:9]]-12\). This transaction served as a symbolic act, demonstrating Jeremiah's faith in God's promise that houses, fields, and vineyards would once again be bought in the land of Judah, despite the impending Babylonian conquest \(Jeremiah 32:15\). The purchase of the field from Hanamel was a sign of hope and future restoration for the people of Israel.
