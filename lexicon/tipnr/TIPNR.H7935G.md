Shecaniah, mentioned in [[1Chr.3.21|1 Chronicles 3:21]]-22, was a descendant of King David through the line of Jeconiah \(also known as Jehoiachin\), who was one of the last kings of Judah before the Babylonian exile. Shecaniah is listed in the genealogy of David's descendants, which traces the royal lineage after the exile. He is identified as the son of Obadiah and the father of Shemaiah, Hattush, Igal, Bariah, Neariah, and Shaphat. The mention of Shecaniah and his sons in this genealogy highlights the continuation of the Davidic line even after the exile and the importance of maintaining family records. The text does not provide any further details about Shecaniah's life, his role within the community, or any specific achievements. However, his inclusion in the genealogy serves to emphasize the enduring significance of the Davidic covenant and the hope for the restoration of the Davidic kingdom, which would ultimately find its fulfillment in the coming of the Messiah.
