Meshullemeth is mentioned in the Second Book of Kings as the mother of Amon, who became king of Judah \([[2Kgs.21.19|2Ki.21.19]]\). She was the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah, a town whose location is unknown. Meshullemeth's son, Amon, succeeded his father, Manasseh, as king of Judah. However, Amon's reign was short-lived, lasting only two years before he was assassinated by his servants. The biblical text does not provide any further information about Meshullemeth's life, her influence on her son, or her role in the royal court. Her mention serves primarily to identify the maternal lineage of King Amon.
