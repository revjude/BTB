Arubboth is mentioned in [[1Kgs.4.10|1 Kings 4:10]] as one of the twelve districts in Israel during the reign of King Solomon. Each district was governed by an officer appointed by Solomon, and these officers were responsible for providing provisions for the king and his household for one month of the year. 

The officer in charge of the district of Arubboth was Hesed, the son of Hesed. The exact location of Arubboth is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in the central or northern part of Israel, as the districts seem to be listed in a roughly geographical order. 

The mention of Arubboth in the context of Solomon's administrative divisions highlights the king's effective organization and management of his kingdom. By appointing officers over specific districts, Solomon ensured a steady supply of resources for the royal court and maintained control over his vast territory. 

Apart from this single reference in the list of Solomon's districts and their officers, no other information about Arubboth is provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in the administrative record underscores the importance of efficient governance and resource management during Solomon's prosperous reign.
