Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Joseph</span> of Arimathea was a wealthy disciple who buried Jesus in his own new tomb.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Matt.27.57|Mat.27.57]]; 
- only referred to as Joseph<[[G2501I]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ἰωσήφ</span>\).

Joseph of Arimathea was a wealthy and prominent member of the Jewish council \([[Matt.27.57|Matthew 27:57]]; [[Mark.15.43|Mark 15:43]]\). He was a disciple of Jesus but secretly out of fear of the Jewish leaders \([[John.19.38|John 19:38]]\). Joseph is described as a good and righteous man who had not consented to the council's decision to condemn Jesus \([[Luke.23.50|Luke 23:50]]-51\). After Jesus' crucifixion, Joseph boldly asked Pilate for Jesus' body \([[Mark.15.43|Mark 15:43]]; [[John.19.38|John 19:38]]\). He took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and placed it in his own new tomb, which had been cut out of rock \([[Matt.27.59|Matthew 27:59]]-60; Mark 15:46; Luke 23:53\). The tomb was then sealed with a large stone \(Matthew 27:60\). Joseph's actions fulfilled the prophecy that the Messiah would be buried with the rich \(Isaiah 53:9\). His selfless act provided a proper burial for Jesus and demonstrated his devotion and respect for the Lord.
