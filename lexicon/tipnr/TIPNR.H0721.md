They are mentioned in the Table of Nations in Genesis 10 and 1 Chronicles 1, which describe the spreading out of Noah's descendants after the flood. The Arvadites likely lived in the city of Arvad, an island city located off the coast of modern-day Syria. Arvad was known for its maritime trade and was a significant Phoenician port city.
