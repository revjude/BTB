Pyrrhus was a Christian from the city of Berea who accompanied Paul on his journey to Asia \(Acts 20:4\). He was part of a group of several individuals, including Sopater, Aristarchus, Secundus, Gaius, Timothy, Tychicus, and Trophimus, who traveled with Paul as he made his way back to Jerusalem after his third missionary journey. These men, representing various churches, were likely entrusted with delivering the collection for the poor in Jerusalem that Paul had gathered from the Gentile churches \(Romans 15:25-28\). Pyrrhus, being from Berea, was probably a member of the church there, which was known for its diligent study of the Scriptures \(Acts 17:10-12\).
