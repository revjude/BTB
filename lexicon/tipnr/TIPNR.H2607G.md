Hanani was a seer who prophesied during the reigns of King Asa and King Jehoshaphat of Judah. He first appears in [[1Kgs.16.1|1 Kings 16:1]], where he delivered a message from God to King Baasha of Israel, warning him of judgment for his evil deeds. Later, during the reign of King Asa of Judah, Hanani rebuked the king for relying on the king of Aram instead of trusting in the Lord \([[2Chr.16.7|2 Chronicles 16:7]]\). As a result, Asa became angry and imprisoned Hanani. Despite this, Hanani's prophecy came true, and Asa suffered from a severe foot disease in his old age \(2 Chronicles 16:12\). Hanani is also mentioned in connection with King Jehoshaphat, Asa's son. After Jehoshaphat formed an alliance with King Ahab of Israel, Hanani's son, Jehu, prophesied against Jehoshaphat \([[2Chr.19.2|2 Chronicles 19:2]]\). The account of Jehoshaphat's reign, including his accomplishments and the events during his time, was recorded in the annals of Hanani the seer \([[2Chr.20.34|2 Chronicles 20:34]]\). Hanani's prophetic ministry spanned multiple generations, and his messages focused on the importance of trusting in God and the consequences of disobedience.
