Mary Magdalene was a devoted follower of Jesus Christ. She was from the town of Magdala and had been healed by Jesus of seven demons \([[Luke.8.2|Luke 8:2]]\). Mary Magdalene was one of the women who supported Jesus' ministry financially and followed Him even to the cross. She witnessed His crucifixion along with other women, including Jesus' mother Mary \(Matthew 27:56; Mark 15:40; John 19:25\). After Jesus' death, Mary Magdalene and other women prepared spices to anoint His body and went to the tomb on the first day of the week. They found the stone rolled away and the tomb empty. Mary Magdalene was the first to see the risen Jesus and was instructed by Him to tell the disciples of His resurrection \(Matthew 28:1; Mark 16:1, 9; Luke 24:10; [[John.20.1|John 20:1]], 11-18\). As a result, she became known as the "apostle to the apostles" for being the first to witness and proclaim the resurrection of Jesus.
