Asaph is mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as the keeper of the king's forest. When Nehemiah requested permission from King Artaxerxes to return to Jerusalem and rebuild its walls, he also asked for letters to Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, to obtain timber for the construction. As the keeper of the king's forest, Asaph was likely responsible for managing and protecting the royal forest lands and overseeing the distribution of timber resources. His cooperation was essential for Nehemiah to secure the necessary materials for the rebuilding project in Jerusalem.
