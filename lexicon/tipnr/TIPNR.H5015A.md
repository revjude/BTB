Nebo was a city in Moab, east of the Jordan River \(Num. 32:3, 38; 1 Chr. 5:8\). It was one of the cities rebuilt by the Reubenites after the conquest of Canaan \(Num. 32:38\). Nebo is also mentioned in prophetic oracles against Moab \(Isa. 15:2; Jer. 48:1, 22\), indicating its significance in Moabite territory. The city was likely named after Mount Nebo, a prominent peak in the Abarim mountain range, from which Moses viewed the Promised Land before his death \(Deut. 32:49; 34:1\).
