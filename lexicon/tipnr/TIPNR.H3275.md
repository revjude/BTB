- A man from the tribe of Gad  living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.5.13|1Ch.5.13]]; 
- only referred to as Jacan<[[H3275]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>כ</span>ָּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ן</span>\); 
-  son of Abihail<[[H0032I]]>; 
- a brother of Michael<[[H4317H]]>, Meshullam<[[H4918I]]>, Sheba<[[H7652G]]>, Jorai<[[H3140]]>, Zia<[[H2127]]> and Eber<[[H5677H]]>.

Jacan is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.5.13|1 Chronicles 5:13]] as one of the leaders from the tribe of Gad during the reign of Jotham, king of Judah. He is listed alongside six other leaders: Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jachan, and Zia. 

This passage is part of a genealogical record of the tribe of Gad, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The Gadites, along with the Reubenites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, settled in the region east of the Jordan River \(1Ch.5.11\). 

The mention of these leaders during the reign of Jotham helps to establish the historical context and timeline of the Gadite tribe. Jotham was a king of Judah who reigned in the 8th century BC, known for doing what was right in the eyes of the Lord \(2Ch.27.2\). 

No other specific details are provided about Jacan's life or role within the tribe. His inclusion in this list, however, suggests that he held a position of authority and responsibility among the Gadites during this period in Israel's history.
