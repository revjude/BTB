Benaiah is mentioned in [[2Chr.20.14|2 Chronicles 20:14]] as the father of Jahaziel, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, during the reign of King Jehoshaphat. The context of the passage is the impending attack on Judah by a vast army from Edom. As the people gathered to seek the Lord's help, the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel, and he prophesied victory for Jehoshaphat and the people of Judah. Jahaziel's prophecy encouraged the king and the people, assuring them that the battle belonged to God and that they would not need to fight. The mention of Benaiah as Jahaziel's father identifies him as a Levite and connects him to the lineage of Asaph, one of the principal musicians and worship leaders in the time of David.
