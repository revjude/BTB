Medan was one of the sons born to Abraham and his concubine Keturah after the death of Sarah. Along with his brothers Zimran, Jokshan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah, Medan was sent away by Abraham with gifts to the land of the east, separating them from Isaac, Abraham's son with Sarah \(Genesis 25:1-6\). Medan is also mentioned in the genealogy of Abraham's descendants in [[1Chr.1.32|1 Chronicles 1:32]]. Little else is known about Medan or his descendants, as they are not mentioned further in the biblical narrative.
