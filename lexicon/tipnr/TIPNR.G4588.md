Sergius Paulus, mentioned in Acts 13:7, was the proconsul of Cyprus during Paul's first missionary journey. He is described as an intelligent man who summoned Barnabas and Saul \(Paul\) because he desired to hear the word of God. However, Elymas, a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet, opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith. Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, confronted Elymas and temporarily blinded him, which led to Sergius Paulus believing, being astonished at the teaching about the Lord. This event marked a significant moment in Paul's ministry, as it demonstrated the power of the gospel to overcome spiritual opposition and reach even high-ranking officials.
