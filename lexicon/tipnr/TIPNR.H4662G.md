The Muster Gate, also known as the Miphkad Gate, was one of the gates of Jerusalem mentioned in the time of Nehemiah \(Neh. 3:31\). It was located on the eastern side of the city, possibly near the temple area. The exact meaning of the name is uncertain, but it may have been a place where troops were mustered or gathered for inspection. Malchijah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs up to the Muster Gate.
