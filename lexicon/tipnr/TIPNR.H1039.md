Beth-nimrah, also known as Nimrah, was a town located east of the Jordan River, in the territory allotted to the tribe of Gad. The name Beth-nimrah means "house of the leopard" or "house of the spotted one" in Hebrew, possibly referring to the presence of leopards in the area or to a local feature that resembled the animal's spots. 

In [[Num.32.3|Numbers 32:3]], the children of Gad and Reuben requested permission from Moses to settle in the land east of the Jordan, citing several cities, including Nimrah, as suitable for their livestock. Moses granted their request on the condition that they would help the other tribes conquer the land west of the Jordan \(Numbers 32:20-22\). 

Later, in [[Num.32.36|Numbers 32:36]], Beth-nimrah is mentioned as one of the cities that the Gadites built or fortified.
