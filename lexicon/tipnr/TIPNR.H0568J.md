Man living at the time of Divided Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Amariah</span> was the chief priest who assisted King Jehoshaphat in his judicial reforms in Judah. \([[2Chr.19.11|2Ch.19.11]]\)
- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[2Chr.19.11|2Ch.19.11]]; 
- only referred to as Amariah<[[H0568J]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>א</span>ֲ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>מ</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ָ֫<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>הו</span>ּ\).

Amariah is mentioned in the context of King Jehoshaphat's judicial reforms in Judah. Jehoshaphat, known for his devotion to God, sought to establish a system of justice based on the laws of God. \(2Ch.19.4-11\) 

As part of these reforms, Jehoshaphat appointed judges in all the fortified cities of Judah and set up a supreme court in Jerusalem. \(2Ch.19.5-8\) He also appointed Levites, priests, and heads of Israelite families to administer justice and settle disputes. \(2Ch.19.8\) 

Amariah, the chief priest, was given authority over all matters concerning the Lord, while Zebadiah, a leader from the tribe of Judah, was responsible for matters concerning the king. \([[2Chr.19.11|2Ch.19.11]]\) This division of authority suggests a separation between religious and civil matters in the administration of justice. 

As the chief priest, Amariah would have been responsible for ensuring that the judges and the people followed God's laws and that the religious aspects of the judicial system were properly maintained. He would have worked closely with the king and the other leaders to implement the reforms and maintain justice in Judah. 

The mention of Amariah in this context highlights the importance of the priesthood in the administration of justice and the collaboration between religious and civil authorities in ancient Israel. It also demonstrates Jehoshaphat's commitment to establishing a just and God-fearing society.
