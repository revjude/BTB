Amon was the son of Manasseh and the 15th king of Judah. He began his reign at the age of 22 and ruled for two years in Jerusalem. Amon followed the evil practices of his father Manasseh, worshiping idols and doing what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not humble himself before the Lord as his father had done. 

Amon's servants conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace. However, the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and they made his son Josiah king in his place. Amon was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza. 

The prophets Jeremiah and Zephaniah began their ministries during the reign of Josiah, Amon's son. Amon is also mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus Christ in the Gospel of Matthew.
