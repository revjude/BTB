Betah is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[2Sam.8.8|2 Samuel 8:8]], as one of the cities from which King David took a large amount of bronze after defeating Hadadezer, the king of Zobah. Zobah was a kingdom located north of Israel, and David's victory over Hadadezer expanded Israel's influence in the region. The exact location of Betah is unknown, but it was likely a city within Hadadezer's kingdom. In the parallel account of David's victory in 1 Chronicles 18:8, the city is called Tibhath, which may be an alternative name for Betah or a scribal variation.
