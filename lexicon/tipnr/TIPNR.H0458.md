Elimelech was a man from Bethlehem in Judah, the husband of Naomi and the father of Mahlon and Chilion \([[2Sam.23.25|Rut.1.2]]\). During a time of famine, Elimelech and his family moved to the country of Moab \(Rut.1.1-2\). While in Moab, Elimelech died, leaving Naomi a widow \(Rut.1.3\). Naomi's sons, Mahlon and Chilion, married Moabite women named Ruth and Orpah, but they also died after about ten years \(Rut.1.4-5\). After the death of her husband and sons, Naomi decided to return to Bethlehem, and her daughter-in-law Ruth accompanied her \(Rut.1.6-22\). Elimelech's family had owned land in Bethlehem, which was later acquired by Boaz, a relative who married Ruth \(Rut.4.3,9\). Through this marriage, Elimelech's lineage was preserved, and his family's property remained within the clan.
