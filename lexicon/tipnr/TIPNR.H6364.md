Pi-beseth, also known as Bubastis, was an ancient Egyptian city located in the eastern Nile Delta. It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Ezekiel's prophecy against Egypt \(Ezek. 30:17\). In this prophecy, Ezekiel declares that the young men of Aven \(or On, another name for Heliopolis\) and Pi-beseth will fall by the sword, and the cities themselves will go into captivity. This judgment is part of a larger oracle against Egypt, in which God declares that He will bring punishment upon the land for its idolatry and opposition to His people. The mention of Pi-beseth alongside other prominent Egyptian cities underscores the severity and scope of the divine judgment that Ezekiel prophesied would come upon the nation.
