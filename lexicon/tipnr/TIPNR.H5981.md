Ummah is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Josh.19.30|Joshua 19:30]], as part of the list of towns allotted to the tribe of Asher during the division of the Promised Land. The exact location of Ummah is uncertain, but it is listed alongside other towns in the western portion of Asher's territory, such as Aphek and Rehob. No further information is provided about the town in the Bible, and its history and significance remain largely unknown. The inclusion of Ummah in the list of Asher's towns highlights the thoroughness of the biblical account in documenting the allotment of the land to the tribes of Israel, even when mentioning relatively obscure places.
