<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Oded</span> was a prophet who confronted the Israelite army returning from a victory over Judah, urging them to release their Judean captives.
- A prophet living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[2Chr.28.9|2Ch.28.9]]; 
- only referred to as Oded **<big>[[H5752|עוֹדֵד]]</big>**.

Oded was a prophet from Samaria who lived during the reign of King Pekah of Israel. When the Israelite army returned from a successful campaign against Judah, bringing back 200,000 captives, Oded confronted them \([[2Chr.28.9|2 Chronicles 28:9]]-11\). He rebuked the army for their intention to enslave their fellow Israelites, reminding them of their own sins against God. Oded warned them of God's fierce wrath if they proceeded with this plan. As a result of his intervention, the Israelite leaders released the captives, provided for their needs, and sent them back to Judah \(2 Chronicles 28:12-15\). Oded's bold prophecy demonstrates the role of prophets in calling the people to repentance and upholding the principles of justice and compassion.
