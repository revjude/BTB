- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.60|Ezr.2.60]]; 
- only referred to as Tobiah **<big>[[H2900|טוֹבִיָּה]]</big>**.

Tobiah is mentioned in [[Ezra.2.60|Ezra 2:60]] and [[Neh.7.62|Nehemiah 7:62]] as an ancestor of some of the returned exiles from Babylon who were unable to prove their Israelite lineage. These individuals were among the descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda, who sought to be registered as priests but were excluded because their names could not be found in the genealogical records. As a result, they were considered unclean and disqualified from serving as priests. The mention of Tobiah in this context highlights the importance of genealogical records in determining priestly eligibility and the challenges faced by some returning exiles in establishing their Israelite identity.
