Besodeiah was the father of Meshullam, one of the individuals who participated in repairing the walls and gates of Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah \(Neh. 3:6\). Meshullam, along with Joiada, the son of Paseah, repaired the Old Gate, which was one of the main entrances to the city. The repair of Jerusalem's walls and gates was a crucial project undertaken by Nehemiah to restore the city's security and strength after the Babylonian exile. Besodeiah's mention as the father of Meshullam highlights the importance of family lineage and the participation of various families in the restoration of Jerusalem.
