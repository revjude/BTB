- A High Priest living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Neh.3.23|Act.23.2]]; 
- only referred to as Ananias<[[G0367I]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ἀνανίας</span>\).

Ananias was the high priest during the time of Paul's trial in Jerusalem. When Paul was brought before the Sanhedrin to face accusations from the Jewish leaders, Ananias presided over the proceedings. During Paul's defense, Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth. Paul, unaware that Ananias was the high priest, rebuked him for commanding him to be struck contrary to the law. Later, when Paul was brought before Felix the governor, Ananias, along with some elders and an orator named Tertullus, presented their case against Paul, accusing him of being a troublemaker and a ringleader of the Nazarene sect.
