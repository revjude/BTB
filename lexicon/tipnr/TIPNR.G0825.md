Attalia, mentioned in Acts 14:25, was a seaport city in the region of Pamphylia, on the southern coast of Asia Minor \(modern-day Turkey\). Paul and Barnabas visited Attalia at the end of Paul's first missionary journey, after preaching the gospel in Perga. From Attalia, they sailed back to Antioch, from where they had originally been sent out. Attalia served as an important harbor in ancient times. The city was founded by and named after Attalus II Philadelphus, a king of Pergamon, in the 2nd century BC.
