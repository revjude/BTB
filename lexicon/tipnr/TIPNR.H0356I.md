Elon is mentioned in [[Josh.19.43|Joshua 19:43]] as one of the cities allotted to the tribe of Dan when the Promised Land was divided among the tribes of Israel. It is listed along with other cities in the western foothills and coastal plain, such as Aijalon, Timnah, and Ekron. 

No further details about Elon are provided in the Bible. Its exact location is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the Shephelah region, between the coastal plain and the Judean hills. The city's name is derived from the Hebrew word for "oak" or "terebinth," suggesting it may have been known for its large trees.
