Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Lysanias</span>, the tetrarch of Abilene, ruled during the time of John the Baptist's ministry \(Lk.3.1\).
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Luke.3.1|Luk.3.1]]; 
- only referred to as Lysanias **<big>[[G3078|Λυσανίας]]</big>**.

Lysanias was the tetrarch of Abilene, a region located in the Anti-Lebanon mountains, during the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar \(Lk.3.1\). He is mentioned in the Gospel of Luke as one of the rulers in power when John the Baptist began his ministry. The title "tetrarch" indicates that Lysanias governed a portion of a divided territory. Historical records suggest that he may have been a descendant of an earlier Lysanias who ruled Chalcis and was executed by Mark Antony in 36 BC. Apart from this brief mention in Luke's Gospel, no further details about Lysanias' life or rule are provided in the Bible. His inclusion in the list of rulers helps to establish the historical and political context of John the Baptist's ministry and the beginning of Jesus' public ministry.
