- A woman living at the time of New Testament, only mentioned at [[Matt.14.6|Mat.14.6]]; 
- only referred to as Salome **<big>[[G2266|Ἡρωδιάς]]</big>**; 
- a daughter of Herod Philip I **<big>[[G5376|Φίλιππος]]</big>** and Herodias **<big>[[G2266|Ἡρωδιάς]]</big>**.

Salome Salome, mentioned in [[Matt.14.6|Matthew 14:6]], was the daughter of Herodias and the stepdaughter of Herod Antipas. During Herod's birthday celebration, Salome danced before the guests, pleasing Herod so much that he promised to give her whatever she asked, up to half his kingdom. Prompted by her mother Herodias, who held a grudge against John the Baptist for speaking out against her marriage to Herod, Salome requested the head of John the Baptist on a platter. Herod, though grieved, felt bound by his oath and ordered the execution of John the Baptist. Salome's dance and her role in John the Baptist's death highlight the moral corruption and political intrigues within Herod's court.
