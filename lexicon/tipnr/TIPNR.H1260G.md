Bered is mentioned in [[Gen.16.14|Genesis 16:14]] as a reference point for the location of the well where Hagar, Sarah's maidservant, encountered the Angel of the Lord. After fleeing from Sarah's harsh treatment, Hagar found herself in the wilderness, where the Angel of the Lord appeared to her near a spring of water. The Angel encouraged Hagar and instructed her to return to Sarah and submit to her authority. Hagar called the name of the Lord "You are the God who sees," and the well was named Beer-lahai-roi, meaning "the well of the Living One who sees me." The verse states that this well was located between Kadesh and Bered. The exact location of Bered is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in the Negev region, south of Canaan.
