Hanani, the brother of Nehemiah, is mentioned in [[Neh.1.2|Nehemiah 1:2]] and 7:2. While Nehemiah was serving as cupbearer to King Artaxerxes in Susa, Hanani and some other men from Judah visited him. They brought a report about the dire situation in Jerusalem, with its walls broken down and gates burned. This news deeply troubled Nehemiah, leading him to pray and fast before God. Later, with the king's permission, Nehemiah traveled to Jerusalem to rebuild the city walls. After the completion of the wall, Nehemiah appointed Hanani, along with Hananiah, as the governors of Jerusalem \([[Neh.7.2|Nehemiah 7:2]]\). Nehemiah chose them because they were considered more faithful and God-fearing than others. As governors, they were responsible for overseeing the city's security and administration. Hanani's role in bringing the report to Nehemiah and his subsequent appointment as a governor highlights his trustworthiness and commitment to the well-being of Jerusalem and its people.
