Gershom was the firstborn son of Moses and Zipporah, born during Moses' exile in Midian \([[Exod.2.22|Exodus 2:22]]\). His name, which means "a stranger there," reflects Moses' feelings of being a foreigner in a strange land. Later, when Moses returned to Egypt to lead the Israelites out of slavery, Gershom and his brother Eliezer were reunited with their father \([[Exod.18.3|Exodus 18:3]]-4\). As a descendant of Levi, Gershom and his descendants were counted among the Levites and assigned duties in the tabernacle and temple service \([[1Chr.23.15|1 Chronicles 23:15]]-16; 26:24\). However, one of Gershom's descendants, Jonathan, became involved in idolatrous worship. According to [[Judg.18.30|Judges 18:30]], Jonathan and his sons served as priests for the tribe of Dan, who had set up a graven image and a shrine. This incident highlights the spiritual decline among some of the Levites and the Israelites during the period of the judges. Despite this unfaithful descendant, Gershom's lineage remained significant within the Levitical priesthood, as evidenced by the mention of his descendants in the genealogies of Chronicles.
