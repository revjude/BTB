Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Hakkoz</span> was a priest whose descendants were unable to prove their priestly lineage after the Babylonian exile.
- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.61|Ezr.2.61]]; 
- only referred to as Hakkoz<[[H6976I]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>ַ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>קו</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ץ</span>\).

Hakkoz is mentioned in [[Ezra.2.61|Ezra 2:61]] and [[Neh.7.63|Nehemiah 7:63]] as one of the priests who returned from the Babylonian exile. However, when the genealogies of the priests were examined, the descendants of Hakkoz were unable to prove their priestly lineage. As a result, they were considered unclean and were excluded from serving as priests. The governor ordered them not to eat from the most holy things until a priest with the Urim and Thummim could resolve the matter. The Urim and Thummim were sacred objects used to determine the will of God. The fact that the descendants of Hakkoz could not provide clear genealogical records suggests that their priestly lineage may have been lost or compromised during the exile.
