- referred to as Shem **<big>[[H8035|שֵׁם]]</big>**, or Shem \(KJV= Sem\)  **<big>[[G4590|Σήμ]]</big>**; 
-  son of Noah **<big>[[H5146|נֹחַ]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Ham **<big>[[H2526|חָם]]</big>** and Japheth **<big>[[H3315|יֶפֶת]]</big>**; 
-  father of Asshur **<big>[[H0804|אַשּׁוּר]]</big>**, Elam **<big>[[H5867|עֵילָם]]</big>**, Arpachshad **<big>[[H0775|אַרְפַּכְשַׁד]]</big>**, Lud **<big>[[H3865|לוּד]]</big>** and Aram **<big>[[H0758|אֲרָם]]</big>**.

Shem was one of the three sons of Noah, along with Ham and Japheth \([[Gen.5.32|Genesis 5:32]]; 6:10\). He and his wife were among the eight people who survived the great flood in the ark \([[Gen.7.13|Genesis 7:13]]\). After the flood, Shem and his brothers became the ancestors of the nations that repopulated the earth \([[Gen.9.18|Genesis 9:18]],19; 10:1\). 

Shem was the ancestor of the Semitic peoples, including the Elamites, Assyrians, Arameans, and Hebrews \([[Gen.10.21|Genesis 10:21]]-31\). He was also the ancestor of Abraham and, therefore, of the Israelites \(Genesis 11:10-26; [[1Chr.1.17|1 Chronicles 1:17]]-27\). In the New Testament, Shem is mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus in [[Luke.3.36|Luke 3:36]]. 

Shem and Japheth showed respect for their father by covering his nakedness when he became drunk \([[Gen.9.23|Genesis 9:23]]\). As a result, Noah blessed Shem, saying, "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem" \([[Gen.9.26|Genesis 9:26]]\). This blessing implied that Shem's descendants would have a special relationship with God. Shem lived for 600 years \(Genesis 11:10-11\).
