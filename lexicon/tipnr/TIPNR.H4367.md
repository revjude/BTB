Machnadebai is mentioned in the book of Ezra as one of the men who had married foreign women during the post-exilic period \([[Ezra.10.40|Ezr.10.40]]\). After the return of the Jewish exiles from Babylon, Ezra, a priest and scribe, led a religious reform to address various issues, including intermarriage with foreign women \(Ezr.9-10\). This practice was seen as a violation of God's commandments and a threat to the religious and cultural identity of the Jewish community. Machnadebai is listed among those who pledged to put away their foreign wives and children, following the counsel of Ezra and the leaders \(Ezr.10.44\). The inclusion of Machnadebai in this list highlights the widespread nature of the issue and the importance of maintaining religious purity and obedience to God's laws in the post-exilic period.
