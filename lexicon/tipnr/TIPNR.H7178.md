Kartan was a city allocated to the Levites within the tribal territory of Naphtali \([[Josh.21.32|Joshua 21:32]]\). It was one of the cities given to the Gershonite clan of the Levites, along with Kedesh, Hammoth-dor, and Rakkath. The Levites were not given a specific territory like the other tribes but were distributed among the various tribes in cities designated for their use. These cities served as places of residence for the Levites, who were responsible for the religious duties in Israel. Its location is unknown.
