Sela, meaning "rock" in Hebrew, was an Edomite stronghold located in the mountainous region of Seir. It is also referred to as Joktheel, a name given to it by King Amaziah of Judah after he captured it \(2 Ki. 14:7; 2 Chr. 25:12\). Sela is mentioned in several biblical passages, often in the context of God's judgment against Edom \(Isa. 16:1; 42:11\). The city was known for its strategic location and natural defenses, as it was situated in a valley surrounded by steep cliffs. Sela is believed to be the ancient name for the city of Petra, the capital of the Nabataean kingdom, which was carved into the rock faces of the surrounding mountains. The Nabataeans, who inhabited the area after the Edomites, further developed the city and its impressive rock-cut architecture. Today, the ruins of Petra are a popular tourist destination and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Jordan.
