Jehohanan is mentioned in [[2Chr.23.1|2 Chronicles 23:1]] as the father of Ishmael, one of the military leaders who supported the priest Jehoiada in his coup against Queen Athaliah. Athaliah had seized the throne of Judah after the death of her son, King Ahaziah, and had ordered the execution of all the royal heirs. However, Jehoiada and his wife, Jehosheba, managed to rescue the young prince Joash and hide him in the temple for six years. In the seventh year, Jehoiada gathered the military leaders, including Ishmael, son of Jehohanan, and revealed the existence of the rightful heir to the throne. The military leaders pledged their support to Joash and helped Jehoiada execute a plan to overthrow Athaliah and install Joash as king. The text does not provide any further information about Jehohanan himself, but his son's involvement in this significant event suggests that the family may have held a prominent position in the military or royal court.
