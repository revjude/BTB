- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Neh.2.19|Neh.2.19]]; 
- only referred to as Geshem<[[H1654]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ג</span>ֶּ֫<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ש</span>ֶׁ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ם</span>\).

Geshem the Arab is mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as one of the main opponents of Nehemiah's efforts to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem in the 5th century BC. Geshem, along with Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite, mocked and ridiculed Nehemiah when they learned of his intention to rebuild the city walls \([[Neh.2.19|Nehemiah 2:19]]\). Later, when the wall was being built, Geshem and his allies conspired to harm Nehemiah and hinder the work. They invited Nehemiah to meet with them in the plain of Ono, but Nehemiah perceived that they intended to do him harm and declined their invitation \([[Neh.6.1|Nehemiah 6:1]]-2\). Geshem and his associates also spread rumors accusing Nehemiah of rebelling against the Persian king and aspiring to become king himself \([[Neh.6.6|Nehemiah 6:6]]-7\). Despite these attempts to intimidate and discourage him, Nehemiah remained focused on his mission and relied on God's protection and guidance. The opposition from Geshem and his allies highlights the political and social challenges faced by the Jewish community as they sought to reestablish themselves in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile.
