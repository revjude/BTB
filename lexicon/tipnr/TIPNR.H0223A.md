Uriah, often referred to as Uriah the Hittite, was a soldier in King David's army \(2 Samuel 11; 12:9-10, 15; 23:39; [[1Kgs.15.5|1 Kings 15:5]]; [[1Chr.11.41|1 Chronicles 11:41]]; [[Matt.1.6|Matthew 1:6]]\). He was married to Bathsheba, with whom David committed adultery while Uriah was away fighting in battle. When Bathsheba became pregnant, David attempted to cover up his sin by summoning Uriah back from the battle and encouraging him to sleep with his wife. However, Uriah's loyalty and sense of duty prevented him from enjoying the comforts of home while his fellow soldiers were in battle. David then sent Uriah back to the front lines with a letter instructing the commander, Joab, to place Uriah in the fiercest part of the battle and then withdraw, ensuring his death. After Uriah's death, David took Bathsheba as his wife, but the Lord was displeased with David's actions. The prophet Nathan confronted David about his sin, and David faced severe consequences, including the death of the child conceived through adultery. Uriah's loyalty and righteousness stand in stark contrast to David's abuse of power and moral failure, serving as a reminder of the importance of integrity and the consequences of sin.
