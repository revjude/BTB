Massah was a location in the wilderness where the Israelites quarreled with Moses and tested the Lord by demanding water \([[Exod.17.7|Exodus 17:7]]\). The name Massah means "testing" or "temptation." At this place, the people grumbled against Moses, questioning whether the Lord was among them or not. Moses, following God's instructions, struck the rock at Horeb, and water came out for the people to drink \(Exodus 17:5-6\). The incident at Massah is later recalled as an example of Israel's rebellion and lack of faith \(Deuteronomy 6:16; 9:22; 33:8; Psalm 95:8\), serving as a warning for future generations not to test the Lord.
