Makkedah was a royal Canaanite city that played a significant role in Joshua's conquest of the southern region of Canaan \([[Josh.12.16|Joshua 12:16]]\). During the battle of Gibeon, the five Amorite kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon fled to Makkedah and hid in a cave \([[Josh.10.16|Joshua 10:16]]\). Joshua pursued them, captured the kings, and executed them \([[Josh.10.17|Joshua 10:17]]-27\). He then attacked and conquered the city of Makkedah, putting its king and inhabitants to the sword \(Joshua 10:28\). Makkedah was later allotted to the tribe of Judah \([[Josh.15.41|Joshua 15:41]]\). The exact location of Makkedah is uncertain, but it is believed to be situated in the Shephelah region, possibly near Azekah and Beth-shemesh.
