Seir is a mountainous region mentioned frequently in the Bible, located in the southern part of the Transjordan, extending from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. It was inhabited by the Horites before the descendants of Esau, the Edomites, dispossessed them \(Gen. 14:6; Deut. 2:12, 22\). 

Seir is closely associated with Esau and his descendants, the Edomites \(Gen. 32:3; 33:14, 16; 36:8, 9\). It is often used interchangeably with Edom to refer to the nation that emerged from Esau's lineage \(Gen. 36:30; Num. 24:18; Deut. 2:4, 8, 29; Josh. 24:4\). 

The region of Seir played a role in several biblical events. It was the location where the kings of the East fought against the Horites \(Gen. 14:6\). Moses and the Israelites passed through Seir during their wilderness wanderings, but were instructed not to provoke the Edomites to war \(Deut. 1:44; 2:4, 8\). Later, during the divided monarchy, King Amaziah of Judah defeated the Edomites in the Valley of Salt and captured Sela, a stronghold in Seir \(2 Chr. 25:11, 14\). 

The prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel also mention Seir in their oracles, often in the context of God's judgment against Edom \(Isa. 21:11; Ezek. 25:8\). The region's rugged terrain and strategic location made it a formidable challenge for invading armies and a symbol of Edom's strength and pride.
