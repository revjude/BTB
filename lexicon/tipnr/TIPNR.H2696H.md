Hezron was the son of Perez and the grandson of Judah, as recorded in [[Gen.46.12|Genesis 46:12]], [[Num.26.21|Numbers 26:21]], and [[1Chr.2.5|1 Chronicles 2:5]]. He was born in Canaan and was one of the 70 members of Jacob's household who migrated to Egypt during the time of Joseph. Hezron's descendants formed a clan within the tribe of Judah, known as the Hezronites \([[Num.26.6|Numbers 26:6]], 21\). 

Hezron is mentioned in the genealogy of King David in Ruth 4:18-19 and [[1Chr.2.9|1 Chronicles 2:9]]-25. He is also listed in the genealogy of Jesus Christ in Matthew 1:3 and [[Luke.3.33|Luke 3:33]], emphasizing his importance in the lineage of the Messiah. 

According to [[1Chr.2.18|1 Chronicles 2:18]]-25, Hezron had several children, including Jerahmeel, Ram \(the ancestor of King David\), and Caleb. He married the daughter of Machir, the father of Gilead, in his old age and had a son named Segub, who became the father of Jair. 

As a descendant of Judah and an ancestor of King David and Jesus Christ, Hezron played a significant role in the history of Israel and the fulfillment of God's promises to His people.
