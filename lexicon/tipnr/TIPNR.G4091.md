Ruler living at the time of the New Testament

Pontius <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Pilate</span>, the Roman governor of Judea who presided over the trial of Jesus and ultimately ordered his crucifixion.
- A Roman ruler living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Matt.27.2|Mat.27.2]]; 
- referred to as Pilate or "he" \(KJV= Pilate\)  **<big>[[G4091|Πιλᾶτος]]</big>**, or Pontius **<big>[[G4194|Πόντιος]]</big>**.

Pontius Pilate was the Roman governor \(prefect\) of Judea during the time of Jesus' ministry and crucifixion \([[Luke.3.1|Luke 3:1]]\). He is most known for his role in the trial and execution of Jesus, as recorded in all four Gospels \(Matthew 27; Mark 15; Luke 23; John 18-19\). 

When Jesus was brought before Pilate by the Jewish leaders, who accused him of claiming to be the king of the Jews, Pilate questioned Jesus and found no fault in him \([[John.18.29|John 18:29]]-38\). However, faced with the insistence of the Jewish leaders and the growing crowd, Pilate ultimately gave in to their demands and ordered Jesus to be crucified \([[Matt.27.2|Matthew 27:2]]4; [[Mark.15.1|Mark 15:1]]5; [[Luke.23.24|Luke 23:24]]; [[John.19.1|John 19:1]]6\). 

Pilate is portrayed as a reluctant participant in Jesus' death, attempting to release him but ultimately succumbing to political pressure \([[John.19.1|John 19:1]]2\). He is also depicted as a somewhat cynical and world-weary figure, as seen in his famous question to Jesus, "What is truth?" \([[John.18.38|John 18:38]]\). 

Pilate's involvement in Jesus' crucifixion is also mentioned in the Book of Acts, where the early Christian leaders affirm that Jesus was crucified under Pontius Pilate \(Acts 3:13; 4:27; 13:28\). In [[1Tim.6.13|1 Timothy 6:13]], Paul refers to Jesus' good confession before Pontius Pilate.
