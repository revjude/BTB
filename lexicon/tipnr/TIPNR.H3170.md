Jahzerah is mentioned in [[1Chr.9.12|1 Chronicles 9:12]] as one of the priests who resided in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. He was a descendant of Immer, who was a priest during the time of King David \(1 Chronicles 24:14\). The text provides no further information about Jahzerah's life or role in the postexilic community. His inclusion in the list of priests suggests that he played a part in reestablishing the temple worship and religious practices in Jerusalem following the return from exile.
