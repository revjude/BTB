Beth-anath was a Canaanite town mentioned in [[Josh.19.38|Joshua 19:38]] as part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Naphtali during the division of the Promised Land. The name Beth-anath means "house of Anath," possibly referring to a temple or shrine dedicated to the Canaanite goddess Anath. In Judges 1:33, it is revealed that the tribe of Naphtali failed to drive out the inhabitants of Beth-anath, and instead, the Canaanites continued to live among them. This failure to completely conquer and occupy the town was part of a larger pattern of the Israelites' incomplete obedience to God's command to drive out the Canaanites from the land. The exact location of Beth-anath is not specified in the Bible, but it was within the territory of Naphtali, which was situated in the northern part of Canaan, in the region of Galilee.
