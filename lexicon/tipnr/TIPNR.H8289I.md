Sharon is a coastal plain mentioned several times in the Bible, known for its beauty, fertility, and lush pastureland. It stretches along the Mediterranean coast from Joppa to Mount Carmel. The region was famous for its flowers, particularly the Rose of Sharon \(Song 2:1\), and its productive fields and forests \(Isa. 35:2\). During the reign of King David, Sharon was known for its herds of cattle, overseen by Shitrai the Sharonite \(1 Chr. 27:29\). The prophet Isaiah used Sharon as a symbol of fruitfulness and blessing, contrasting it with the desolation brought by God's judgment \(Isa. 33:9; 65:10\). In the New Testament, the plain of Sharon is mentioned in connection with the ministry of the apostle Peter, who healed Aeneas in Lydda and proclaimed the gospel throughout the region \(Acts 9:35\). The fertile soil and moderate climate of Sharon made it a prosperous agricultural area, supporting a variety of crops and livestock. Its location along the coastal trade routes also contributed to its economic significance in ancient Israel.
