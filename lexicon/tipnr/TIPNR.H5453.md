Sibraim is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the prophet Ezekiel's vision of the boundaries of the restored Promised Land \(Ezek. 47:16\). In this vision, Ezekiel describes the northern border of the land, extending from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River. Sibraim is listed as one of the landmarks along this border, situated between the territory of Damascus and that of Hamath. 

The exact location of Sibraim is uncertain, as it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in other historical sources. Some scholars propose that it may be identified with the modern-day village of Khirbet Sariman, located about 40 miles northeast of Damascus. However, this identification remains tentative due to the lack of conclusive evidence. 

Ezekiel's vision of the restored Promised Land and its boundaries, including the mention of Sibraim, emphasizes God's faithfulness to His covenant promises and His plan to restore Israel to its rightful inheritance. The delineation of the land's borders also highlights the importance of God's sovereign allotment and the need for His people to trust in His provision and guidance.
