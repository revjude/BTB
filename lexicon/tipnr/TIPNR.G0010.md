- A man from the tribe of Judah living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at Mat.1.13; 
- only referred to as Abiud<[[G0010]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Ἀβιούδ</span>\);

Abiud is mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus Christ recorded in the Gospel of Matthew \(Matthew 1:13\). He was the son of Zerubbabel, a prominent figure in the post-exilic period who led the first group of Jewish exiles back to Jerusalem from Babylon and oversaw the rebuilding of the temple \(Ezra 2:2; Haggai 1:1\). 

In the genealogy, Abiud is listed as the father of Eliakim and is an ancestor of Joseph, the husband of Mary, the mother of Jesus. The genealogy in Matthew traces Jesus' lineage through the kings of Judah, highlighting His royal descent and His fulfillment of the messianic prophecies. 

Apart from his mention in the genealogy, no other details are provided about Abiud's life, his role in the community, or any significant events associated with him. His inclusion in the genealogy serves to demonstrate Jesus' connection to the Davidic line and to emphasize the continuity of God's plan of redemption throughout Israel's history.
