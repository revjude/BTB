Achan was an Israelite from the tribe of Judah who violated God's command by taking devoted things from the conquered city of Jericho \(Jos. 7:1\). His sin caused Israel's defeat in the battle against Ai. When Joshua sought the Lord's guidance, God revealed that someone had stolen from the devoted things \(Jos. 7:10-15\). 

Through a process of elimination, Achan was identified as the culprit \(Jos. 7:16-18\). He confessed to taking a beautiful cloak from Shinar, silver, and gold, hiding them in his tent \(Jos. 7:19-21\). As a result, Achan and his family were stoned to death, and their remains were burned \(Jos. 7:24-25\). The place where this occurred was named the Valley of Achor, meaning "trouble" \(Jos. 7:26\). Achan's sin and its consequences were remembered as a warning against unfaithfulness to God \(Jos. 22:20\).
