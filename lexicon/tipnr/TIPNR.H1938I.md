Hodaviah is mentioned in [[1Chr.9.7|1 Chronicles 9:7]] as one of the Benjamites who lived in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. He is listed among the first to resettle in the city, along with other members of his tribe. 

The Benjamites were one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Benjamin, the youngest son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\). After the Babylonian conquest of Judah in 586 BC, many Israelites were taken into captivity. When the Persian king Cyrus allowed the Jews to return to their homeland, some Benjamites, including Hodaviah, were among the first to resettle in Jerusalem. 

The resettlement of Jerusalem was a significant event in the history of Israel, as it marked the beginning of the restoration of the nation and the rebuilding of the temple. As one of the first to return, Hodaviah would have played a role in the reestablishment of the Jewish community in the city. 

The mention of Hodaviah and other Benjamites in this passage underscores the importance of all the tribes of Israel in the life and history of the nation, even after the exile.
