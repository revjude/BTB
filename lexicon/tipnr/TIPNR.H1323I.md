Bath-shua is mentioned in [[1Chr.2.3|1 Chronicles 2:3]] as the Canaanite wife of Judah, son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\). She gave birth to Judah's first three sons: Er, Onan, and Shelah. This brief genealogical note is the only information provided about Bath-shua in the Bible. Her Canaanite origin is significant, as it shows that Judah married outside of his own people, which was not in line with the patriarchs' practice of seeking wives from their own kinsmen. The mention of Bath-shua's sons is also important, as the narrative in Genesis 38 reveals that Er and Onan died due to their wickedness, leaving Judah without an heir until the birth of his twins, Perez and Zerah, through his daughter-in-law Tamar. Bath-shua's inclusion in the genealogy highlights the complex family dynamics and the importance of Judah's lineage in the history of Israel.
