Tishbe, also known as Tishbite, is mentioned in the Bible as the hometown of the prophet Elijah \(1 Kgs. 17:1\). Elijah is often referred to as "Elijah the Tishbite" or "Elijah of Tishbe in Gilead," indicating that the town was located in the region of Gilead, east of the Jordan River. Tishbe is not mentioned in any other context in the Bible, and its exact location remains uncertain. Some scholars propose that it may be associated with the town of Listib, mentioned in the 14th-century BC Amarna letters, which was situated in northern Gilead. Elijah's ministry took place during the reigns of Ahab and Ahaziah, kings of Israel, and he played a significant role in confronting the worship of Baal and delivering God's messages to the kings \(1 Kgs. 21:17-28; 2 Kgs. 1:3-8; 9:36\).
