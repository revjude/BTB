Deborah's adversary living before Israel's Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Sisera</span> was the commander of the Canaanite army who was defeated by the Israelites under the leadership of Deborah and Barak.
- Deborah's adversary living before Israel's Monarchy, first mentioned at [[Judg.4.2|Jdg.4.2]]; 
- only referred to as Sisera **<big>[[H5516|סִיסְרָא]]</big>**.

Sisera was the commander of the Canaanite army under King Jabin of Hazor, who oppressed the Israelites for twenty years during the time of the judges \([[Judg.4.2|Judges 4:2]]-3\). Deborah, a prophetess and judge of Israel, summoned Barak and instructed him to gather an army to fight against Sisera \(Judges 4:4-7\). Barak agreed to go only if Deborah accompanied him, to which she consented but prophesied that the honor of the victory would go to a woman \(Judges 4:8-9\). In the ensuing battle at Mount Tabor, the Lord routed Sisera's army, and Barak pursued them \([[Judg.4.14|Judges 4:14]]-16\). Sisera fled on foot and sought refuge in the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite \([[Judg.4.17|Judges 4:17]]\). Jael welcomed Sisera and gave him a drink, but while he slept, she drove a tent peg through his temple, killing him \([[Judg.4.18|Judges 4:18]]-21\). The victory song of Deborah and Barak celebrates the defeat of Sisera and the role of Jael in his demise \(Judges 5:24-31\). The story of Sisera's defeat is also mentioned in [[1Sam.12.9|1 Samuel 12:9]] as an example of God's deliverance of Israel from their oppressors and in Psalm 83:9 as a prayer for God to defeat Israel's enemies as He did with Sisera. The account of Sisera's downfall highlights the power of God to deliver His people and the role of women in His plan.
