Woman living at the time of the Patriarchs

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Iscah</span> was the daughter of Haran and sister of Milcah and Lot \([[Gen.11.29|Gen.11.29]]\).
- A woman living at the time of the Patriarchs, only mentioned at [[Gen.11.29|Gen.11.29]]; 
- only referred to as Iscah **<big>[[H3252|יִסְכָּה]]</big>**; 
-  daughter of Haran **<big>[[H2039|הָרָן]]</big>**; 
- a sister of Lot **<big>[[H3876|לוֹט]]</big>** and Milcah **<big>[[H4435|מִלְכָּה]]</big>**.

Iscah is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Gen.11.29|Genesis 11:29]]. She was the daughter of Haran, who was the brother of Abraham. Iscah's sister was Milcah, who married Abraham's brother Nahor. Iscah was also the sister of Lot, Abraham's nephew who later lived in Sodom. 

No other details are given about Iscah in the biblical record. Her mention in the genealogy establishes her as a relative of Abraham, but she does not appear to play any role in the narratives concerning him. Some Jewish traditions identify her with Sarah, Abraham's wife, but there is no clear evidence for this in the biblical text. As Haran's daughter, Iscah was born in Ur of the Chaldeans and was part of the family that originally set out with Abraham for Canaan \(Gen.11.31\).
