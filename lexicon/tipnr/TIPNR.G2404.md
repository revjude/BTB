Hierapolis was an ancient city located in the region of Phrygia, in modern-day Turkey. It is mentioned once in the New Testament, in Paul's letter to the Colossians \([[Col.4.13|Col.4.13]]\). In this passage, Paul expresses his concern for the believers in Hierapolis, along with those in Laodicea and Colossae. This suggests that there was a Christian community in Hierapolis during the first century AD. Hierapolis was known for its hot springs and became a popular spa city in the Roman period. The city was also associated with the worship of the Phrygian mother goddess Cybele. The ruins of Hierapolis, including well-preserved Roman baths, temples, and a necropolis, can still be seen today.
