Seba is mentioned in [[Gen.10.7|Genesis 10:7]] and [[1Chr.1.9|1 Chronicles 1:9]] as a son of Cush and a brother of Raamah. He is listed among the descendants of Ham, one of Noah's sons, in the Table of Nations. The Table of Nations in Genesis 10 provides a genealogical record of the repopulation of the earth after the Flood. Seba and his relatives are associated with the southern Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa region. Although little is known about Seba as an individual, his mention in the genealogy suggests that he was a significant ancestor of a people group or region.
