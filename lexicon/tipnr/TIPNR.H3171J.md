Jehiel is mentioned in [[2Chr.21.2|2 Chronicles 21:2]] as one of the sons of King Jehoshaphat of Judah. He is listed along with his brothers Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah. The text states that Jehoshaphat gave his sons many gifts of silver, gold, and valuable possessions, as well as fortified cities in Judah. However, the kingdom was given to Jehoram, Jehoshaphat's firstborn son. The passage does not provide any further information about Jehiel's life or his role in the royal family. His mention in this context serves to highlight the wealth and power of Jehoshaphat's reign and the practice of providing for the king's sons, even though the firstborn would inherit the throne.
