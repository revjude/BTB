- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Neh.10.11|Neh.10.11]]; 
- only referred to as Mica **<big>[[H4316|מִיכָא]]</big>**.

Mica is mentioned in the book of Nehemiah as one of the priests who sealed the covenant with Nehemiah \([[Neh.10.11|Neh.10.11]]\). After the completion of the wall of Jerusalem and the public reading of the Law, the people of Israel made a covenant to follow God's commandments and ordinances. The leaders, Levites, and priests, including Mica, sealed this covenant, pledging to uphold its stipulations. This act demonstrated Mica's commitment to the spiritual renewal and obedience of the Jewish community in the post-exilic period.
