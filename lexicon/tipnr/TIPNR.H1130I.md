- A King of Aram living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Kgs.13.3|2Ki.13.3]]; 
- only referred to as Ben-hadad **<big>[[H1130|בֶּן־הֲדַד]]</big>**; 
- a son of Hazael **<big>[[H2371|חֲזָאֵל]]</big>**.

Ben-hadad I was the king of Aram \(Syria\) who oppressed Israel during the reigns of Jehoahaz and Jehoash, kings of Israel. The Lord allowed Ben-hadad to prevail against Israel because of their sins \(2 Ki. 13:3\). However, before his death, Ben-hadad returned the cities his father had taken from Israel \(2 Ki. 13:24-25\). The prophet Amos also prophesied against Ben-hadad, declaring that God would send fire upon his house \(Amos 1:4\). Ben-hadad was a powerful enemy of Israel, but God ultimately delivered His people from this oppressor.
