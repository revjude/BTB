Levite living at the time of United Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Abijah</span> was one of Samuel's sons who served as a judge in Israel but did not follow his father's righteous ways.
- A man from the tribe of Levi living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[1Sam.8.2|1Sa.8.2]]; 
- only referred to as Abijah **<big>[[H0029|אֲבִיָּה]]</big>**; 
-  son of Samuel **<big>[[H8050|שְׁמוּאֵל]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Joel **<big>[[H3100|יוֹאֵל]]</big>**.

Abijah was one of the sons of Samuel, the last judge and a prominent prophet in Israel. Along with his brother Joel, Abijah was appointed by Samuel as a judge over Israel in his old age \(1 Samuel 8:1-2\). However, Abijah and his brother did not walk in the righteous ways of their father. They turned aside after dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice \(1 Samuel 8:3\). 

The corrupt behavior of Abijah and Joel led the elders of Israel to demand a king to rule over them, rejecting the leadership of Samuel and his sons \(1 Samuel 8:4-5\). This event marked the transition from the period of the judges to the establishment of the monarchy in Israel. Abijah is also mentioned in the genealogy of the Levites in [[1Chr.6.28|1 Chronicles 6:28]], confirming his lineage as a descendant of Levi through Samuel.
