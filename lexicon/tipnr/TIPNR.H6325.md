Punon was a stopping place for the Israelites during their wilderness journey, mentioned only in the list of encampments in Numbers 33. The Israelites arrived at Punon after departing from Zalmonah and before moving on to Oboth \(Num. 33:42-43\). The exact location of Punon is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the region of Edom, east of the Jordan River. According to the Jewish-Roman historian Josephus and early Christian scholars Eusebius and Jerome, Punon was identified with Phaeno \(or Phinon\), a site known for its copper mines and located between the ancient cities of Petra and Zoar. However, this identification remains speculative due to the lack of conclusive archaeological evidence. The biblical record does not provide any details about the events that occurred during the Israelites' stay at Punon, but its inclusion in the itinerary highlights the numerous stages and challenges the Israelites faced during their 40-year journey from Egypt to the Promised Land.
