Pedaiah was the father of Zebidah, who was the mother of King Jehoiakim of Judah, according to [[2Kgs.23.36|2 Kings 23:36]]. Zebidah was from Rumah, but no other details are given about Pedaiah. Jehoiakim was placed on the throne by Pharaoh Necho of Egypt after he deposed Jehoiakim's younger brother Jehoahaz. Jehoiakim's reign was characterized by political turmoil, as Judah came under the domination of Egypt and then Babylon. The brief mention of Pedaiah provides some genealogical background for Jehoiakim.
