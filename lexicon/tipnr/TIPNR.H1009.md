Beth-arbel is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Hos.10.14|Hosea 10:14]], as part of a prophecy against Israel. In this verse, the prophet Hosea warns that the fortresses of Israel will be destroyed, just as Shalman devastated Beth-arbel on the day of battle, when mothers were dashed to the ground with their children. 

The exact location of Beth-arbel is uncertain, and the identity of Shalman is also a matter of debate. Some scholars believe that Beth-arbel may refer to the city of Arbela, located in the region of Galilee, which was known for its fortified caves. Others suggest that it might be a reference to the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III or Shalmaneser V, who were involved in campaigns against Israel and Judah. 

The destruction of Beth-arbel is used by Hosea as an example of the impending judgment that would come upon Israel because of their unfaithfulness to God. The vivid description of the city's destruction, with mothers and children being killed, emphasizes the severity of the coming judgment.
