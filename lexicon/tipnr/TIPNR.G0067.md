Agrippa, also known as Herod Agrippa II, was the great-grandson of Herod the Great. He ruled over various territories in Judea during the time of Paul's imprisonment in Caesarea. Agrippa, along with his sister Bernice, visited Festus, the Roman governor. Festus presented Paul's case to Agrippa, who expressed his desire to hear Paul. \([[2Sam.23.11|Act.25.13]]-27\) 

The next day, Paul appeared before Agrippa and Bernice and made his defense, recounting his conversion and ministry. Agrippa, familiar with Jewish customs and controversies, listened intently. Paul appealed to Agrippa's belief in the prophets and challenged him to believe in Christ. Agrippa replied, "Do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to be a Christian?" \(Act.26.1-28\).
