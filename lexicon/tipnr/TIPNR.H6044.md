Anim is mentioned in [[Josh.15.50|Joshua 15:50]] as one of the cities allotted to the tribe of Judah in the hill country. It is listed among other towns such as Eshtemoh, Goshen, and Holon, indicating its location in the southern part of Judah's territory. The exact site of Anim is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the vicinity of Hebron, a major city in the hill country. 

The allocation of Anim to Judah is part of the detailed description of the tribal territories in the book of Joshua. After the conquest of Canaan under Joshua's leadership, the land was divided among the tribes of Israel. The listing of cities and towns, including Anim, demonstrates the systematic distribution of the land and the establishment of Judah's presence in the region. 

Apart from its mention in the list of Judah's cities, no other information about Anim is provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in the territorial allotment highlights its significance as a settlement in the hill country during the early period of Israel's history in the Promised Land.
