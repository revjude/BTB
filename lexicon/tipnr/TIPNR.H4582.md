Maoch, also known as Maacah, was the father of Achish, the king of Gath, a Philistine city. When David was fleeing from King Saul, he sought refuge with Achish in Gath. Achish, the son of Maoch, received David and his men, allowing them to settle in the city. Later, when David was king of Israel, two of his servants fled to Achish, the son of Maacah, in Gath \([[1Sam.27.2|1 Samuel 27:2]]; [[1Kgs.2.39|1 Kings 2:39]]\). The variation in the name \(Maoch or Maacah\) may indicate different spellings or translations of the same name.
