- A man from the tribe of Levi living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.24.27|1Ch.24.27]]; 
- only referred to as Ibri **<big>[[H5681|עִבְרִי]]</big>**; 
-  son of Jaaziah **<big>[[H3269|יַעֲזִיָּהוּ]]</big>**; 
- a brother of Beno **<big>[[H1121|בֵּן]]</big>**, Shoham **<big>[[H7719|שֹׁהַם]]</big>** and Zaccur **<big>[[H2139|זַכּוּר]]</big>**.

Ibri is mentioned in [[1Chr.24.27|1 Chronicles 24:27]] as a descendant of Merari, one of the three main divisions of the Levites. The Levites were the Israelite tribe designated to assist the priests in the tabernacle and temple services. 

In the context of 1 Chronicles 24, the Levites are being organized into divisions for their service in the temple during the reign of King David. This organization was carried out by David and the leaders of the Levites, with the purpose of ensuring a systematic and orderly approach to the Levitical duties. 

Ibri is specifically mentioned as one of the descendants of Merari, along with his relatives Jaaziah, Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri \(verse 26-27\). This listing of names suggests that Ibri and his family members were part of the Merarite clan and were included in the divisions of Levitical service. 

The organization of the Levites into divisions was a significant step in establishing a structured and efficient system for the temple service. It also ensured that all the Levitical families had an opportunity to serve in the temple and that the responsibilities were evenly distributed among them. 

Apart from being mentioned in this genealogical list, no other specific information is provided about Ibri in the Bible. His inclusion in the record highlights the importance of the Levitical role in ancient Israelite worship and the efforts made by David to organize and regulate the temple service.
