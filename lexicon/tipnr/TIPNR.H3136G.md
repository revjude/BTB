- A priest living at the time of Exile and Return, only mentioned at [[Ezra.10.18|Ezr.10.18]]; 
- only referred to as Jozadak<[[H3136G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>יו</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>צ</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ק</span>\); 
-  father of Jeshua<[[H3442G]]>.

Jozadak is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.18|Ezra 10:18]] in the context of the priests who had married foreign women during the post-exilic period. The passage is part of Ezra's reforms and his efforts to address the issue of intermarriage between the Israelites and the pagan peoples of the land \(Ezra 9-10\). 

In the list of priests who had married foreign women, some of the descendants of Jozadak are mentioned \([[Ezra.10.18|Ezra 10:18]]\). This indicates that even among the priestly families, there were those who had violated the commandment to refrain from intermarrying with the surrounding nations \(Deuteronomy 7:3-4\). 

As part of the covenant made under Ezra's leadership, these priests agreed to put away their foreign wives and children \(Ezra 10:19\). This event underscores the importance of maintaining religious and cultural purity among the Israelites, particularly in the post-exilic period when they were re-establishing their identity and covenant relationship with God.
