Shimei was a Benjamite from the family of Saul who encountered King David during Absalom's rebellion \(2 Sa. 16:5\). As David fled Jerusalem, Shimei cursed him, threw stones at him, and accused him of being a murderer and a wicked man \(2 Sa. 16:7, 13\). After Absalom's defeat, Shimei met David at the Jordan River, seeking forgiveness for his actions \(2 Sa. 19:16, 18\). Although Abishai, one of David's men, wanted to kill Shimei, David spared his life \(2 Sa. 19:21, 23\). However, on his deathbed, David instructed his son Solomon to deal with Shimei, suggesting that he should not be left unpunished \(1 Ki. 2:8-9\). Solomon later confined Shimei to Jerusalem and warned him that leaving the city would result in his death, a condition Shimei initially accepted \(1 Ki. 2:36-38\). However, when Shimei violated this agreement by leaving Jerusalem to retrieve his runaway servants, Solomon ordered his execution \(1 Ki. 2:39-46\).
