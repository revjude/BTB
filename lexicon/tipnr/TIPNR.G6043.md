Joda is mentioned in [[Luke.3.26|Luke 3:26]] as one of the ancestors of Jesus Christ in the genealogy traced through Joseph, Jesus' legal father. He is listed as the son of Joanan and the father of Josech. This genealogy spans from Jesus back to Adam, emphasizing Jesus' connection to all of humanity. 

The genealogy in Luke's Gospel differs from the one recorded in Matthew's Gospel, as Luke traces Jesus' lineage through David's son Nathan, while Matthew traces it through Solomon. The two genealogies converge at Zerubbabel and Shealtiel, after the Babylonian exile.
