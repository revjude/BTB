Gemalli is mentioned briefly in [[Num.13.12|Numbers 13:12]] as the father of Ammiel, the representative of the tribe of Dan among the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan. The twelve spies, one from each tribe, were chosen to assess the land, its inhabitants, and its resources \(Numbers 13:17-20\). Ammiel, son of Gemalli, was the spy selected from the tribe of Dan. The spies returned after forty days with a report of a land flowing with milk and honey, but also inhabited by strong peoples \(Numbers 13:25-28\). Ten of the spies, including Ammiel, brought back a discouraging report, emphasizing the challenges of conquering the land \(Numbers 13:31-33\). Only Joshua and Caleb, the spies from the tribes of Ephraim and Judah, respectively, gave a positive report and encouraged the people to trust in God's promise \(Numbers 14:6-9\). As a result of the people's unbelief and rebellion, God declared that the generation who had witnessed the Exodus would not enter the Promised Land, except for Joshua and Caleb \(Numbers 14:20-35\).
