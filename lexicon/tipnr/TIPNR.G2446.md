The Jordan River, the most prominent river in the Bible, flows from north to south through the Jordan Valley and empties into the Dead Sea. The river and its surrounding region, also known as the Jordan Valley or the Plain of Jordan, are mentioned numerous times throughout the Old and New Testaments. The Jordan River formed the eastern boundary of the Promised Land \([[Num.34.12|Numbers 34:12]]\) and was crossed by the Israelites under Joshua's leadership when they entered Canaan \(Joshua 3-4\). The river also served as a boundary between the tribes settling east and west of the Jordan \([[Josh.22.25|Joshua 22:25]]\). Several significant events took place along the Jordan, including the parting of the river for Elijah and Elisha \([[2Kgs.2.6|2 Kings 2:6]]-14\), Naaman's healing \([[2Kgs.5.10|2 Kings 5:10]]-14\), and John the Baptist's ministry of baptism \([[Matt.3.5|Matthew 3:5]]-6; [[Mark.1.5|Mark 1:5]]\). The Jordan Valley was known for its fertile land, as seen in Lot's choice to settle there \([[Gen.13.10|Genesis 13:10]]-11\). The region also served as a refuge for Elijah \([[1Kgs.17.3|1 Kings 17:3]]-5\) and David \(2 Samuel 17:22-24\). In the New Testament, Jesus was baptized in the Jordan River \([[Matt.3.13|Matthew 3:13]]; [[Mark.1.9|Mark 1:9]]\) and conducted ministry in the region \([[Matt.4.25|Matthew 4:25]]; 19:1\). The Jordan River and its surrounding area continue to hold great significance for Christians, Jews, and Muslims today.
