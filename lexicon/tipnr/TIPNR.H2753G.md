Hori, the son of Shaphat, was a member of the tribe of Simeon who was chosen as one of the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan \([[Num.13.5|Numbers 13:5]]\). This event took place during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt. 

Moses selected one man from each of the twelve tribes to survey the Promised Land and bring back a report about its inhabitants, cities, and agricultural potential \(Numbers 13:1-2, 17-20\). Hori was the representative chosen from the tribe of Simeon. 

The twelve spies, including Hori, spent forty days exploring the land of Canaan \(Numbers 13:25\). Upon their return, they brought back samples of the land's produce, including a cluster of grapes so large that it had to be carried on a pole between two men \(Numbers 13:23\). However, ten of the spies, excluding Caleb and Joshua, gave a discouraging report, emphasing the difficulties.
