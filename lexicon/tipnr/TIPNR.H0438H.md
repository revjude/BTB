Allon is mentioned briefly in the genealogy of the tribe of Simeon, which is recorded in the book of 1 Chronicles. He is listed as the son of Jedaiah, who was a descendant of Simeon through his son Shimei. \([[1Chr.4.37|1Ch.4.37]]\) 

The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 4 traces the lineage of several clans within the tribe of Simeon, providing a record of their descendants and their settlements in the land of Israel. \(1Ch.4.24-43\) 

Apart from being listed as the son of Jedaiah, no further information is provided about Allon's life, his role within the family, or any significant events associated with him. 

The mention of Allon in the genealogy serves to document the lineage of the Simeonite clans and to highlight the importance of family records in the Israelite society. It also demonstrates the continuity of the tribe of Simeon through its various branches and generations.
