Pithom was one of the store cities built by the Israelites during their time of slavery in Egypt \(Exod. 1:11\). The Egyptians appointed taskmasters over the Israelites to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. The construction of these cities was part of the Egyptians' plan to subdue the growing Israelite population and prevent them from joining forces with Egypt's enemies in case of war \(Exod. 1:9-10\). The exact location of Pithom is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the eastern Nile Delta region, possibly near the modern-day city of Tell el-Maskhuta. The name "Pithom" is thought to be derived from the Egyptian "Per-Atum," meaning "House of Atum," referring to the Egyptian god Atum. The mention of Pithom in the book of Exodus serves to illustrate the harsh conditions and oppression experienced by the Israelites in Egypt, setting the stage for God's miraculous deliverance of His people.
