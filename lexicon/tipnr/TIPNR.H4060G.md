The Bible mentions a huge man from Gath in [[2Sam.21.20|2 Samuel 21:20]] and [[1Chr.20.6|1 Chronicles 20:6]]. This man is not named but is described as having six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, a total of twenty-four digits. 

The huge man was from Gath, one of the five major Philistine cities. The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel during the reigns of Saul and David, and there were numerous battles between the two nations. 

In the context of these battles, the huge man is mentioned as a formidable opponent. He is described as being born to the giant, possibly indicating that he was a descendant of the Rephaim, a race of giants mentioned in the Bible \(Deuteronomy 2:11, 20\). 

Despite his size and strength, the huge man was killed by David's warriors during a battle with the Philistines. In [[2Sam.21.20|2 Samuel 21:20]], it is mentioned that he was killed by Jonathan, the son of Shimea, David's brother. In [[1Chr.20.6|1 Chronicles 20:6]], the credit for killing the huge man is given to David's warriors collectively. 

The defeat of the huge man from Gath demonstrates the bravery and skill of David's warriors and highlights the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Philistines during this period in Israel's history.
