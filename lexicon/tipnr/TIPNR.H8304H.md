Seraiah, mentioned in [[2Kgs.25.18|2 Kings 25:18]], 1 Chronicles 6:14, [[Ezra.7.1|Ezra 7:1]], [[Neh.11.11|Nehemiah 11:11]], and [[Jer.52.24|Jeremiah 52:24]], was the high priest during the reign of King Zedekiah, the last king of Judah before the Babylonian exile. As the high priest, Seraiah held the highest religious authority in the land and was responsible for overseeing the temple services and religious practices. He was also a descendant of Aaron, as evident from the genealogical records in 1 Chronicles and Ezra. Tragically, after the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians, Seraiah was captured and executed by Nebuzaradan, the captain of the Babylonian guard, at Riblah. His death marked the end of the line of high priests serving in the first temple.
