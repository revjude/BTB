Eneglaim is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Ezek.47.10|Ezekiel 47:10]], as part of the prophet's vision of the restored land of Israel. In this vision, Ezekiel sees a river flowing from the temple, bringing life and healing to the land. He describes a future time when fishermen will stand along the shore of the Dead Sea, from En-gedi to Eneglaim, and spread their nets to catch an abundance of fish. 

The name Eneglaim likely means "spring of the two calves" or "fountain of the two heifers." Its exact location is unknown, but based on the context, it was probably situated near the Dead Sea, possibly at its northern end, opposite En-gedi. The mention of Eneglaim alongside En-gedi suggests it may have been a significant landmark or settlement. 

Ezekiel's vision portrays a future restoration of Israel, with the land flourishing and providing sustenance for its people. The reference to Eneglaim, though brief, contributes to this picture of abundance and renewal.
