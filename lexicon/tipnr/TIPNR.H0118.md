Adalia was one of the ten sons of Haman, the notorious enemy of the Jews in the book of Esther. Haman, a high-ranking official in the Persian court, had plotted to destroy all the Jews in the empire due to his hatred for Mordecai, a Jew who refused to bow down to him \(Esther 3:5-6\). 

However, Haman's plot was foiled by Queen Esther, who revealed her Jewish identity to King Ahasuerus and exposed Haman's evil scheme \(Esther 7:1-6\). As a result, Haman was hanged on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai \(Esther 7:9-10\). 

Following Haman's death, King Ahasuerus granted the Jews the right to defend themselves against their enemies \(Esther 8:11\). On the appointed day, the Jews successfully defended themselves and killed many of their attackers, including Haman's ten sons \(Esther 9:5-10\). 

Adalia is mentioned by name among the sons of Haman who were killed \([[Esth.9.8|Esther 9:8]]\). The deaths of Haman's sons served as a powerful demonstration of the reversal of fortune and the triumph of the Jews over their enemies. Adalia and his brothers, who would have inherited their father's position and influence, were instead destroyed as a consequence of their father's wickedness.
