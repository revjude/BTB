The Guard Gate, also known as the Prison Gate in the King James Version, was one of the gates in the wall of Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah. It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Neh.12.39|Nehemiah 12:39]], during the description of the dedication ceremony for the rebuilt wall of Jerusalem. 

During this dedication, Nehemiah divided the leaders of Judah into two large choirs. One choir proceeded on top of the wall to the right, toward the Dung Gate \(Nehemiah 12:31\). The second choir, which included Nehemiah, went to the left. They marched on the wall past several gates and towers, including the Gate of Ephraim, the Old Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, the Tower of the Hundred, and the Sheep Gate, until they stopped at the Guard Gate \(Nehemiah 12:38-39\). 

Based on its location in the description of the procession, the Guard Gate appears to have been situated on the eastern side of the city, near the Temple area. Many scholars believe it to be the same gate as the Muster Gate or Inspection Gate, mentioned in Nehemiah 3:31 as being near the Temple. 

The exact purpose of this gate is not specified in the biblical text. Its name suggests it may have been a point where guards were stationed or where prisoners were kept, but this is not stated explicitly. It could also possibly refer to a place where people or goods were inspected before entering the city or Temple precincts. 

Apart from this single reference in Nehemiah, no other information is provided about the Guard Gate in the Bible. Its mention in the context of the wall's dedication ceremony highlights its significance as part of Jerusalem's fortifications during the post-exilic period.
