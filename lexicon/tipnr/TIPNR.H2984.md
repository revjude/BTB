- David's son from the tribe of Judah living at the time of United Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Sam.5.15|2Sa.5.15]]; 
- only referred to as Ibhar<[[H2984]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ב</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ח</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>\); 
-  son of David<[[H1732]]>; 
- a brother of Amnon<[[H0550G]]>, Chileab<[[H3609]]>, Absalom<[[H0053]]>, Adonijah<[[H0138G]]>, Shephatiah<[[H8203G]]>, Ithream<[[H3507]]>, Shammua<[[H8051H]]>, Shobab<[[H7727G]]>, Nathan<[[H5416G]]>, Solomon<[[H8010]]>, Elishua<[[H0474]]>, Nepheg<[[H5298H]]>, Japhia<[[H3309I]]>, Elishama<[[H0476H]]>, Eliada<[[H0450G]]>, Eliphelet<[[H0467G]]>, Tamar<[[H8559H]]>, Elpelet<[[H0467I]]>, Nogah<[[H5052]]> and Jerimoth<[[H3406N]]>.

Ibhar is mentioned in two parallel passages \([[2Sam.5.15|2 Samuel 5:15]] and [[1Chr.14.5|1 Chronicles 14:5]]\) as one of the sons born to King David in Jerusalem. He is also listed in [[1Chr.3.6|1 Chronicles 3:6]] among David's descendants. 

David, the second king of Israel, had several wives and concubines, and the Bible records that he fathered many children. Ibhar was one of the sons born to David after he had conquered Jerusalem and made it his capital city. 

The mention of Ibhar in these genealogical records highlights the importance of family lineage in ancient Israelite society. The chronicling of David's descendants, including Ibhar, serves to establish the royal line and emphasize the continuity of the Davidic dynasty. 

Apart from being listed among David's sons, no further information is provided about Ibhar in the Bible. His inclusion in the genealogies suggests that he was part of David's large family and that his birth was considered significant enough to be recorded in the scriptural accounts of David's life and reign.
