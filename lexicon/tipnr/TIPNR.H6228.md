Ashan was a city located in the Shephelah, or the lowlands, of Judah. It is mentioned in the Bible as part of the territorial allotments given to the tribes of Judah and Simeon after the conquest of Canaan. 

In [[Josh.15.42|Joshua 15:42]], Ashan is listed among the cities in the Shephelah region that were allocated to Judah. However, in [[Josh.19.7|Joshua 19:7]] and [[1Chr.4.32|1 Chronicles 4:32]], Ashan is included in the list of cities given to the tribe of Simeon within Judah's inheritance. 

Later, in [[1Chr.6.59|1 Chronicles 6:59]], Ashan is mentioned as one of the cities given to the Levites, specifically to the descendants of Aaron, along with its pasturelands. This suggests that Ashan was designated as a Levitical city, where the priests and Levites resided and served in their sacred duties. 

The exact location of Ashan is uncertain, but it is generally believed to be situated in the northwestern part of the Judean Shephelah, possibly near the city of Libnah. Some scholars propose identifying Ashan with the modern site of Khirbet Hasan, approximately 7 miles \(11 km\) northwest of Lachish. 

The biblical references to Ashan highlight its inclusion in the territorial distribution of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel. Its assignment to both Judah and Simeon and its subsequent designation as a Levitical city underscore the complex process of land allocation and the provision for the Levites within the inherited territories.
