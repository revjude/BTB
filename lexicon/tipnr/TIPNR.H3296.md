Jaare-oregim, also known as Jair, is mentioned in two parallel passages \([[2Sam.21.19|2 Samuel 21:19]] and [[1Chr.20.5|1 Chronicles 20:5]]\) as the father of Elhanan, one of David's mighty warriors. The name Jaare-oregim is likely a scribal error or a variant spelling of Jair, as the latter name is used in [[1Chr.20.5|1 Chronicles 20:5]]. 

Elhanan, the son of Jaare-oregim \(Jair\), is credited with killing Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite, in a battle against the Philistines at Gob. This event is similar to David's famous encounter with Goliath \(1 Samuel 17\), but it involves Elhanan killing Goliath's brother rather than Goliath himself. 

The mention of Jaare-oregim \(Jair\) serves to identify Elhanan and connect him to his father. It also highlights the ongoing conflicts between the Israelites and the Philistines during David's reign and the bravery of David's mighty warriors in these battles. 

No other information is provided about Jaare-oregim \(Jair\) himself, as the focus is on his son Elhanan's achievement. The inclusion of this event in the biblical record demonstrates the importance of individual heroic acts in the larger context of Israel's military history.
