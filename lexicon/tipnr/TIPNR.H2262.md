Habazziniah is mentioned in [[Jer.35.3|Jeremiah 35:3]] as the grandfather of Jaazaniah, who was a leader of the Rechabites during the time of the prophet Jeremiah. The Rechabites were a nomadic tribe known for their strict adherence to the commands of their ancestor, Jonadab son of Rechab. They abstained from drinking wine, planting crops, and living in permanent dwellings \(Jeremiah 35:6-7\). Jeremiah used the Rechabites' obedience to their ancestor's commands as an example to contrast with the disobedience of the people of Judah to God's commands \(Jeremiah 35:12-19\).
