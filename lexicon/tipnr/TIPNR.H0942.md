Bavvai, the son of Henadad, was a ruler of half the district of Keilah who participated in repairing a section of Jerusalem's wall during the time of Nehemiah \(Neh. 3:18\). He worked alongside Ezer, the son of Jeshua, who was the ruler of Mizpah. The repair of Jerusalem's walls was a significant project undertaken by Nehemiah to restore the city's security and strength after the Babylonian exile. Bavvai's involvement as a leader in this project demonstrates the collective effort and dedication of the Jewish community in rebuilding their homeland.
