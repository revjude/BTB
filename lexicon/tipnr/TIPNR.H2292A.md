Haggai was a prophet who lived in Jerusalem during the post-exilic period, after the Jews had returned from Babylonian captivity. He is mentioned in the book bearing his name and in [[Ezra.5.1|Ezra 5:1]] and 6:14. Haggai, along with the prophet Zechariah, played a crucial role in encouraging the people to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem, which had been destroyed by the Babylonians. In the second year of King Darius of Persia, Haggai delivered a series of messages to the governor of Judah, Zerubbabel, and the high priest, Joshua, urging them to resume the work on the temple \([[Hag.1.1|Haggai 1:1]], 3, 12\). He confronted the people about their misplaced priorities, as they had focused on building their own houses while neglecting the house of God \(Haggai 1:4, 9\). Haggai's prophecies also included messages of hope, assuring the people that God would bless them and that the glory of the new temple would surpass that of the former \(Haggai 2:9\). As a result of Haggai's exhortations, the people obeyed, and the work on the temple resumed \([[Hag.1.1|Haggai 1:1]]2-15\). The temple was eventually completed in the sixth year of King Darius \([[Ezra.6.14|Ezra 6:14]]-15\).
