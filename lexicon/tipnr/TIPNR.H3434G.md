Jashobeam, also referred to as Josheb-basshebet, was a prominent figure among David's mighty men. He is mentioned in [[1Chr.11.11|1 Chronicles 11:11]] and 27:2, as well as [[2Sam.23.8|2 Samuel 23:8]]. Jashobeam was the son of Hachmoni and is described as the chief of the mighty men. In [[1Chr.11.11|1 Chronicles 11:11]], it is recorded that he wielded his spear against 300 men and killed them in a single encounter. This feat demonstrates his exceptional skill and bravery as a warrior. In [[1Chr.27.2|1 Chronicles 27:2]], Jashobeam is listed as the leader of the first division of David's army, which served the king in the first month of each year. This position indicates that he held a high rank and was trusted with significant military responsibilities. The variations in his name, "Jashobeam" and "Josheb-basshebet," may be due to textual differences or scribal errors in the transmission of the biblical text.
