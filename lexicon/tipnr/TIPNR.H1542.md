Giloh, also referred to as Gilo, was a city located in the hill country of Judah, mentioned in the territorial allotment of the tribe of Judah \([[Josh.15.51|Joshua 15:51]]\). It is most notably known as the hometown of Ahithophel, a wise counselor who served King David \([[2Sam.23.34|2 Samuel 23:34]]\). However, during Absalom's rebellion against David, Ahithophel sided with Absalom and provided him with counsel \([[2Sam.15.12|2 Samuel 15:12]]\). Ahithophel's defection was a significant blow to David, given his reputation for wisdom and insight. When Absalom rejected Ahithophel's advice in favor of Hushai's counsel, Ahithophel returned to Giloh and hanged himself, perceiving that Absalom's cause was doomed \(2 Samuel 17:23\). Apart from its association with Ahithophel, little else is known about Giloh from the biblical text. Its mention in the narrative of Absalom's rebellion highlights the political and personal turmoil that David faced during his reign.
