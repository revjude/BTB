Socoh, also spelled Sochoh or Shochoh, was a town located in the Shephelah, or lowlands, of Judah \(Josh. 15:35\). It is mentioned several times in the Bible, most notably in connection with the famous battle between David and Goliath. 

In the account of David's confrontation with Goliath, the Philistines gathered their forces for war at Socoh, while the Israelites camped in the Valley of Elah \(1 Sam. 17:1\). It was in this valley that David, armed only with a sling and five smooth stones, defeated the giant Goliath, leading to a great victory for Israel \(1 Sam. 17:40-54\). 

During the reign of King Solomon, Socoh was included in the district overseen by Ben-hesed, one of the twelve officers responsible for providing food for the king and his household \(1 Ki. 4:10\). 

Later, when Rehoboam, Solomon's son, became king, he fortified Socoh as part of his efforts to strengthen the defenses of Judah \(2 Chr. 11:7\). However, during the reign of King Ahaz, Socoh was among the towns captured by the Philistines \(2 Chr. 28:18\). 

The exact location of Socoh is uncertain, but it is believed to be either Khirbet Abbad or Khirbet Shuweikeh, both located in the Shephelah region.
