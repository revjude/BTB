During this time, David had taken refuge among the Philistines, and a group of warriors from various tribes of Israel came to support him. Azmaveth, along with other skilled archers and slingers from the tribe of Benjamin, pledged their allegiance to David and fought alongside him. The fact that these warriors were willing to leave their homes and families to support David demonstrates their belief in his leadership and their commitment to his cause. The support of these warriors was crucial to David's eventual success in establishing his kingdom and uniting the tribes of Israel under his rule.
