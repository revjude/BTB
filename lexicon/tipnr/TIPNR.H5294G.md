Neariah is mentioned in [[1Chr.3.22|1 Chronicles 3:22]]-23 as a descendant of King David through the line of Solomon. He was the son of Shemaiah and is listed among the descendants of Jeconiah \(also known as Jehoiachin\), the king of Judah who was exiled to Babylon. 

The genealogical record in 1 Chronicles 3 traces the royal line of David, demonstrating the continuity of the Davidic dynasty even after the Babylonian exile. Neariah's mention in this genealogy serves to establish his place within the lineage of David and to highlight the preservation of David's descendants. 

According to the text, Neariah had three sons: Elioenai, Hizkiah, and Azrikam. Beyond this information, no further details are provided about Neariah's life, his role within the family, or the historical context in which he lived. 

The inclusion of Neariah and his sons in the genealogy may indicate that they held some importance or influence within the post-exilic Jewish community. The chronicler's decision to record their names suggests that they were recognized as part of the royal lineage and that their descendants may have played a role in the restoration of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the temple. 

However, given the limited information available, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about Neariah's specific contributions or the significance of his family in the broader historical context. His presence in the genealogy primarily serves to demonstrate the enduring legacy of David's dynasty and the fulfillment of God's promise to maintain David's throne.
