<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Rhesa</span> was the son of Zerubbabel and an ancestor of Jesus Christ, according to Luke's genealogy.
- A man from the tribe of Judah living at the time ofExile and return, only mentioned at [[Luke.3.27|Luk.3.27]]; 
- only referred to as Rhesa **<big>[[G4488|Ῥησά]]</big>**; 
- a son of Zerubbabel **<big>[[G2216|Ζοροβάβελ]]</big>**; 
-  father of Joanan **<big>[[G2490|Ἰωαννᾶς]]</big>**.

Rhesa is mentioned in [[Luke.3.27|Luke 3:27]] as the son of Zerubbabel and an ancestor of Jesus Christ. He appears in the genealogy of Jesus recorded in the Gospel of Luke, which traces Jesus' lineage back to Adam through his mother, Mary. Zerubbabel, Rhesa's father, was a significant figure in Jewish history, as he led the first group of exiles back to Jerusalem from Babylon and oversaw the rebuilding of the temple \(Ezra 3:2, 8; 5:2\). The name Rhesa is not mentioned in the Old Testament, and little is known about him apart from his inclusion in Jesus' genealogy. His presence in the genealogy serves to bridge the gap between the well-known figure of Zerubbabel and the subsequent generations leading up to Jesus. The inclusion of Rhesa in the genealogy highlights the importance of family lineage in Jewish culture and the fulfillment of God's promises through the generations, ultimately leading to the birth of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.
