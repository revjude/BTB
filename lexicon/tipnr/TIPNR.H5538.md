Silla is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the context of the assassination of King Joash of Judah \(2 Ki. 12:20\). Joash, who had been hiding in the Temple of the Lord, was killed by his servants at the house of Millo, on the way down to Silla. The exact location of Silla is unknown, but it was likely a place in or near Jerusalem, possibly a road or a district in the city. Some scholars propose that Silla may be related to the Hebrew word "mesillah," meaning "highway" or "causeway," suggesting that it could have been a major thoroughfare. The assassination of Joash at Silla marked the end of his reign and the beginning of the reign of his son Amaziah \(2 Ki. 12:21\). This event highlights the political instability and violence that often characterized the monarchy in Judah and Israel.
