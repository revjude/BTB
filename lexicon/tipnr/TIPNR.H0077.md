Ebez was a town located in the territory allotted to the tribe of Issachar during the division of the Promised Land under Joshua. It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the list of cities and towns assigned to Issachar \([[Josh.19.20|Joshua 19:20]]\). The exact location of Ebez is unknown, but it was likely situated in the fertile plains of the Jezreel Valley, which was part of Issachar's inheritance. As one of the towns within Issachar's designated territory, Ebez would have been part of the network of settlements that the tribe established as they settled in the land of Canaan.
