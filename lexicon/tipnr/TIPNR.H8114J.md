Shemariah is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.41|Ezra 10:41]] as another Israelite who had married a foreign woman during the Babylonian exile. This verse is part of a list of men who had taken foreign wives, which was a significant issue addressed by Ezra after the return of the exiles to Jerusalem. Ezra called for the people to separate themselves from their foreign wives and children to preserve the identity and religious purity of the Jewish community. Shemariah, like the other men on this list, agreed to put away his foreign wife in compliance with Ezra's instruction.
