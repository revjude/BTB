- A man from the tribe of Asher living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[1Chr.7.36|1Ch.7.36]]; 
- only referred to as Imrah<[[H3236]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>מ</span>ְ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ה</span>\); 
-  son of Zophah<[[H6690]]>; 
- a brother of Suah<[[H5477]]>, Harnepher<[[H2774]]>, Shual<[[H7777B]]>, Beri<[[H1275]]>, Bezer<[[H1221H]]>, Hod<[[H1936]]>, Shamma<[[H8037H]]>, Shilshah<[[H8030]]>, Ithran<[[H3506H]]> and Beera<[[H0878]]>.

Imrah is mentioned briefly in [[1Chr.7.36|1 Chronicles 7:36]] as one of the sons of Zophah, who was a descendant of Asher. Asher was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, and the genealogy in 1 Chronicles 7 lists the descendants of this tribe. 

Imrah is listed along with his brothers Harnepher, Shual, Beri, and Imrah. The mention of these names in the genealogical record suggests that they were significant figures within the tribe of Asher and that their lineage was considered important enough to be recorded. 

However, apart from this brief mention in the genealogy, no other details are provided about Imrah's life, his role within the tribe, or any significant events or accomplishments associated with him. 

The genealogical records in Chronicles serve to establish the family lines and tribal affiliations of the Israelites, particularly in the post-exilic period when many of them were returning to their homeland and seeking to reestablish their identity as God's chosen people. 

The name Imrah is derived from the Hebrew root meaning "to rebel" or "to be contentious." However, it is not clear whether this meaning has any bearing on the character or life of the individual mentioned in the genealogy.
