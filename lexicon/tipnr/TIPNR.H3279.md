Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Jaalah</span> was among the descendants of Solomon's servants who returned to Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile \([[Ezra.2.56|Ezr.2.56]]; [[Neh.7.58|Neh.7.58]]\).
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.56|Ezr.2.56]]; 
- referred to as Jaalah or Jaala **<big>[[H3279|יַעֲלָא]]</big>**.

Jaalah is mentioned in two parallel passages, [[Ezra.2.56|Ezra 2:56]] and [[Neh.7.58|Nehemiah 7:58]], as one of the descendants of Solomon's servants who returned to Jerusalem and Judah after the Babylonian exile. The lists in these chapters record the individuals and families who were part of the first wave of returnees under the leadership of Zerubbabel. 

Solomon's servants were likely a group of people who had been assigned to work in various capacities during King Solomon's reign, possibly as laborers, craftsmen, or administrators. Their descendants maintained this identity even after the exile. 

The mention of Jaalah and the other descendants of Solomon's servants in these lists highlights the diverse composition of the returning exiles, which included not only priests, Levites, and ordinary Israelites but also those from various occupational groups. 

No further information is provided about Jaalah's specific role or family. The inclusion of the descendants of Solomon's servants in the return from exile demonstrates God's faithfulness in preserving and restoring His people according to His promises.
