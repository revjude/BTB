Giddalti is mentioned in [[1Chr.25.4|1 Chronicles 25:4]] and 29 as one of the sons of Heman, a Levite appointed by King David as a temple musician. Heman, along with Asaph and Jeduthun, was a chief musician responsible for leading worship in the tabernacle \(1 Chronicles 25:1, 6\). Giddalti and his brothers were skilled in music and prophecy, using lyres, harps, and cymbals to prophesy and give thanks and praise to the Lord \(1 Chronicles 25:3\). The musicians were divided into twenty-four groups, each responsible for serving in the temple for a specific period. Giddalti was the head of the twenty-second group \([[1Chr.25.29|1 Chronicles 25:29]]\). The appointment of Giddalti and his fellow musicians highlights the importance of music and worship in the Israelite religion and the structured organization of temple services during David's reign.
