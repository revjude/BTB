Nahshon, the son of Amminadab, was a prominent figure in the tribe of Judah during the Israelites' exodus from Egypt and their subsequent wilderness journey. He is mentioned in several books of the Bible, including Exodus, Numbers, Ruth, 1 Chronicles, Matthew, and Luke. 

According to [[Exod.6.23|Exodus 6:23]], Nahshon was the brother-in-law of Aaron, as his sister Elisheba was married to Aaron. This connection to the priestly family highlights Nahshon's significant status within the tribe of Judah. 

In [[Num.1.7|Numbers 1:7]] and 2:3, Nahshon is identified as the leader of the tribe of Judah during the census and the arrangement of the Israelite camp in the wilderness. As the head of Judah, he was responsible for a large portion of the Israelite population and held a position of authority and responsibility. 

Nahshon's leadership role is further emphasized in [[Num.7.12|Numbers 7:12]],17, where he is the first of the tribal leaders to present offerings at the dedication of the tabernacle. His offering, like those of the other leaders, included silver and gold vessels, as well as animals for sacrifice. 

In [[Num.10.14|Numbers 10:14]], Nahshon is mentioned again as the leader of the tribe of Judah when the Israelites set out from Mount Sinai, following the order of march determined by God. 

The genealogies in Ruth 4:20, [[1Chr.2.10|1 Chronicles 2:10]]-11, Matthew 1:4, and [[Luke.3.32|Luke 3:32]] identify Nahshon as an ancestor of King David and, consequently, of Jesus Christ. This lineage underscores the importance of Nahshon's role in the history of Israel and God's plan of redemption. 

Nahshon's life and leadership during the exodus and wilderness journey demonstrate his faithfulness and obedience to God. His prominent position within the tribe of Judah and his place in the lineage of David and Jesus make him a significant figure in the biblical narrative.
