Amariah is mentioned in the list of people who were chosen to resettle in Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah. He is identified as a descendant of Perez, who was a son of Judah. \([[Neh.11.4|Neh.11.4]]\) 

After the completion of the wall of Jerusalem, Nehemiah took measures to ensure the security and prosperity of the city. One of these measures was to bring people to live in Jerusalem, as the city was large and spacious but had a small population. \(Neh.7.4\). 

Leaders of the people and one-tenth of the general population were selected by lot to reside in Jerusalem, while the remaining people stayed in their own towns. \(Neh.11.1-2\) 

Amariah is listed among the descendants of Judah who were chosen to live in Jerusalem. \([[Neh.11.4|Neh.11.4]]\) This suggests that he and his family were considered reliable and capable of contributing to the well-being of the city. 

The resettlement of Jerusalem was crucial for the reestablishment of the Jewish community after the Babylonian exile. By bringing people to live in the city, Nehemiah aimed to strengthen Jerusalem's defenses, support the temple service, and foster the growth and stability of the community. 

The mention of Amariah in this list highlights the importance of the participation of various families and individuals in the restoration of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the Jewish society.
