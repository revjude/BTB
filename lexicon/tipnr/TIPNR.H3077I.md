Jehoiada, the son of Benaiah, is mentioned in [[1Chr.27.34|1 Chronicles 27:34]] as a counselor to King David. This chapter lists the various officials and administrators who served during David's reign, including the counselors who advised the king. Jehoiada is specifically noted as the successor to Ahithophel, who had been David's previous counselor before he defected to support Absalom's rebellion \(2 Samuel 15:12, 31\). 

The fact that Jehoiada is identified as the son of Benaiah suggests that he may have been the grandson of the high priest Jehoiada.
