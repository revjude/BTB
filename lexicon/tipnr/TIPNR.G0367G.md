- A man living at the time of the New Testament, first mentioned at [[Neh.3.23|Act.5.1]]; 
- only referred to as Ananias **<big>[[G0367|Ἀνανίας]]</big>**; 
- husband of Sapphira **<big>[[G4551|Σαπφείρη]]</big>**.

Ananias, along with his wife Sapphira, was a member of the early Christian church in Jerusalem. They sold a piece of property and brought a portion of the proceeds to the apostles, claiming it was the full amount. However, they had conspired to keep back part of the money for themselves. When confronted by the Apostle Peter about their deception, Ananias fell down and died instantly. Later, when Sapphira came in, unaware of her husband's fate, she also lied about the transaction and met the same judgment. Their story serves as a stark warning against lying and hypocrisy within the church community.
