Abihail is mentioned in [[Num.3.35|Numbers 3:35]] as the father of Zuriel, who was the leader of the Merarite clan during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness. The Merarites were one of the three main divisions of the Levites, alongside the Gershonites and the Kohathites. 

As the leader of the Merarites, Zuriel was responsible for overseeing the transportation and setup of the tabernacle's framework, including the boards, bars, pillars, and sockets \(Numbers 3:36-37\). The Merarites were under the overall leadership of Ithamar, one of Aaron's sons. 

No additional information is provided about Abihail himself in the biblical text, apart from being the father of Zuriel. His mention serves to identify Zuriel's lineage and his role within the Levitical clan structure.
