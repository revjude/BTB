Abiram was the firstborn son of Hiel the Bethelite, who lived during the reign of King Ahab of Israel. When Hiel rebuilt the city of Jericho, he laid the foundation at the cost of Abiram's life \([[1Kgs.16.34|1 Kings 16:34]]\). This fulfilled the prophecy spoken by Joshua after the conquest of Jericho, stating that whoever rebuilt the city would do so at the cost of his firstborn son \(Joshua 6:26\). 

The death of Abiram as a consequence of his father's actions serves as a reminder of the importance of obedience to God's commands and the seriousness of disregarding His warnings. It also highlights the enduring nature of God's word and the certainty of His judgments.
