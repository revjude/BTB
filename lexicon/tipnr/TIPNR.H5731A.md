<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Eden</span>, a Levite from the family of Joah, assisted in the cleansing of the temple during Hezekiah's reign. \([[2Chr.29.12|2Ch.29.12]]\)
- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[2Chr.29.12|2Ch.29.12]]; 
- only referred to as Eden<[[H5731A]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ֵ֫<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ֶ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ן</span>\); 
- a son of Joah<[[H3098L]]>.

Eden is mentioned in [[2Chr.29.12|2 Chronicles 29:12]] as one of the Levites who participated in the cleansing and rededication of the temple during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. He is identified as a member of the family of Joah, which was a Levitical clan. 

The context of this passage is Hezekiah's reformation of the religious practices in Judah. Upon ascending to the throne, Hezekiah opened the doors of the temple and ordered the Levites to cleanse and sanctify it, as it had been neglected and defiled during the reign of his father, Ahaz \(2 Chronicles 29:3-5\). 

In response to the king's command, the Levites, including Eden, gathered to cleanse the temple. They removed all the unclean items, carried them to the Kidron Valley, and purified the temple according to the Law of Moses \(2 Chronicles 29:15-16\). 

Eden's participation in this cleansing process highlights the importance of the Levites' role in maintaining the sanctity of the temple and assisting in the restoration of proper worship practices. The mention of his family clan, Joah, suggests that specific Levitical families had designated duties within the temple service. 

Apart from this brief mention, no further information is provided about Eden or his specific role in the temple cleansing. His inclusion in the narrative emphasizes the collective effort of the Levites in supporting Hezekiah's religious reforms and their dedication to restoring the temple and its services.
