Maroth is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[Mic.1.12|Micah 1:12]], as part of a series of judgments against the towns of Judah. The prophet Micah declares, "For the inhabitant of Maroth waited anxiously for good, but disaster came down from the Lord to the gate of Jerusalem." The name Maroth means "bitterness" or "sorrow," possibly reflecting the town's fate. No further details about the location are provided in the Bible.
