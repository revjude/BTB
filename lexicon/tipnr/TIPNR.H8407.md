Tiglath-pileser, also referred to as "the great" or "Pul," was a powerful Assyrian king who reigned from 745 to 727 BC. He is mentioned in several passages in the Old Testament \(2 Kings 15:19,29; 16:7,10; [[1Chr.5.6|1 Chronicles 5:6]],26; [[2Chr.28.20|2 Chronicles 28:20]]; [[Hos.5.13|Hosea 5:13]]; 10:6\). Tiglath-pileser's reign marked the beginning of the Neo-Assyrian Empire's expansion and dominance in the ancient Near East. He is known for his military conquests and political reforms. In the biblical account, Tiglath-pileser received tribute from King Menahem of Israel \(2 Kings 15:19\) and later conquered parts of Israel, including Gilead, Galilee, and Naphtali, deporting the inhabitants to Assyria \([[2Kgs.15.29|2 Kings 15:29]]; [[1Chr.5.26|1 Chronicles 5:26]]\). King Ahaz of Judah sought Tiglath-pileser's help against the kings of Israel and Syria, but this alliance ultimately led to Judah's subjugation and religious compromises \([[2Kgs.16.7|2 Kings 16:7]]-10; [[2Chr.28.20|2 Chronicles 28:20]]\). The prophet Hosea denounced Israel's reliance on Assyria, symbolized by Tiglath-pileser, as futile and contrary to trust in God \([[Hos.5.13|Hosea 5:13]]; 10:6\). Tiglath-pileser's reign marked a significant turning point in the history of Israel and Judah, as the Assyrian Empire's expansion posed an increasing threat to their sovereignty and independence.
