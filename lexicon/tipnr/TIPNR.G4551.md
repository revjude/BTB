Woman living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Sapphira</span>, along with her husband Ananias, lied to the apostles about the proceeds from a property sale and died as a result.
- A woman living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[1Chr.20.4|Act.5.1]]; 
- only referred to as Sapphira<[[G4551]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Σαπφείρη</span>\); 
- wife of Ananias<[[G0367G]]>.

Sapphira is mentioned in Acts 5:1 as the wife of Ananias, a member of the early Christian church in Jerusalem. The couple sold a piece of property and conspired to keep back part of the proceeds for themselves while presenting the remainder to the apostles as if it were the full amount \(Acts 5:1-2\). When Ananias presented the money to the apostles, Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, confronted him about his deception, and Ananias fell down and died \(Acts 5:3-5\). About three hours later, Sapphira came in, unaware of her husband's fate. Peter questioned her about the price of the land, and she also lied, confirming the amount that Ananias had presented \(Acts 5:7-8\). Peter then rebuked her for testing the Spirit of the Lord and informed her that those who had buried her husband would also carry her out. Immediately, Sapphira fell down at Peter's feet and died \(Acts 5:9-10\). The story of Ananias and Sapphira serves as a sobering example of the consequences of deception and the importance of honesty and integrity within the early church community.
