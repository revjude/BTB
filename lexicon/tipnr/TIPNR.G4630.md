- A priest living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[Isa.10.29|Act.19.14]]; called Sceva <[[G4630]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Σκευᾶς</span>\)

Sceva is mentioned in Acts 19:14 as a Jewish chief priest whose seven sons were involved in the practice of exorcism. The context of this passage is Paul's ministry in Ephesus, where he performed extraordinary miracles, and many people were delivered from evil spirits \(Acts 19:11-12\). Some itinerant Jewish exorcists, including the seven sons of Sceva, attempted to invoke the name of Jesus over those possessed by evil spirits, saying, "We exorcise you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches" \(Acts 19:13\). However, when they tried to exorcise a man with an evil spirit, the spirit responded, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?" \(Acts 19:15\). The possessed man then overpowered the sons of Sceva, and they fled naked and wounded.
