The Kenites were a nomadic tribe mentioned throughout the Old Testament. They lived in the region of Canaan and were generally friendly to the Israelites, often providing them with assistance and support. 

The Kenites are first mentioned in [[Gen.15.19|Genesis 15:19]] as one of the tribes inhabiting the land that God promised to give to Abraham's descendants. In [[Num.24.21|Numbers 24:21]], the Kenites are described as having a strong and secure dwelling place, possibly indicating their skill in metalworking and their strategic location. 

During the Israelites' conquest of Canaan, the Kenites, particularly Hobab \(also known as Jethro\), Moses' father-in-law, joined the tribe of Judah and settled in the Negev region \([[Judg.1.16|Judges 1:16]]\). The Kenites maintained a close relationship with the Israelites, as evidenced by the story of Jael, a Kenite woman who killed Sisera, the commander of the Canaanite army, aiding the Israelite victory \([[Judg.4.11|Judges 4:11]], 17-22; 5:24\). 

The Kenites' loyalty to the Israelites is further demonstrated when Saul, during his campaign against the Amalekites, warned the Kenites to separate themselves from the Amalekites to avoid being destroyed along with them \(1 Samuel 15:6\). The Kenites heeded this warning and remained on friendly terms with the Israelites. 

Later, during David's time as a fugitive from Saul, he sent gifts to the Kenites, among other friendly tribes, acknowledging their support \([[1Sam.27.10|1 Samuel 27:10]]; 30:29\). 

In [[1Chr.2.55|1 Chronicles 2:55]], the Kenites are mentioned as scribes living in Jabez, suggesting that some Kenites may have taken on administrative roles within Israelite society. 

Throughout the biblical narrative, the Kenites are portrayed as a friendly and supportive tribe to the Israelites, playing a role in their early history and settlement in the Promised Land.
