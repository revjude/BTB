- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.60|Ezr.2.60]]; 
- only referred to as Delaiah<[[H1806I]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ְּ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ל</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>י</span>ָ֫<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>הו</span>ּ\).

Delaiah is mentioned in [[Ezra.2.60|Ezra 2:60]] and [[Neh.7.62|Nehemiah 7:62]] as an ancestor of a priestly family that returned to Jerusalem from the Babylonian exile. This family, along with the families of Tobiah and Nekoda, sought to be included among the priests but could not prove their genealogy or priestly lineage. 

The context of these passages is the listing of the exiles who returned to Jerusalem and Judah under the leadership of Zerubbabel. The list includes the numbers of people from various families, as well as priests, Levites, and temple servants. 

The inability of Delaiah's descendants to prove their priestly lineage suggests that during the exile, some families may have lost their genealogical records or had their priestly status questioned. As a result, they were not allowed to serve as priests until a priest with the Urim and Thummim could determine their status \(Ezra 2:63; Nehemiah 7:65\). 

The mention of Delaiah's family in this context highlights the importance of maintaining accurate genealogical records, especially for those serving in priestly roles. It also underscores the challenges faced by some families in reestablishing their identity and roles after the exile.
