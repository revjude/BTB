Sithri is mentioned briefly in [[Exod.6.22|Exodus 6:22]] as one of the sons of Uzziel, who was a descendant of Kohath, the son of Levi. The Kohathites were one of the three main branches of the Levites, along with the Gershonites and Merarites. The Levites were the tribe chosen by God to serve in the tabernacle and later in the temple. Sithri is listed among the Kohathites in the genealogical record, which emphasizes the importance of the Levitical lineage and their role in the religious life of Israel.
