Bigvai was one of the leaders of the people who sealed the covenant during the time of Nehemiah \(Neh. 10:16\). The covenant was a solemn agreement made by the returned exiles to follow the Law of God and to maintain their distinct identity as God's chosen people. By sealing the covenant, Bigvai and the other leaders pledged to uphold its terms, which included observing the Sabbath, avoiding intermarriage with foreigners, and supporting the temple service. This event demonstrates the renewed commitment of the Jewish community to their faith and their determination to restore their relationship with God after the Babylonian exile.
