In [[1Kgs.9.13|1 Kings 9:13]], Cabul is mentioned as the name given by Hiram, king of Tyre, to a group of twenty cities in Galilee that were given to him by King Solomon of Israel. Solomon had received gold, cedar, and cypress wood from Hiram for the construction of the Temple and his palace. In return, Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. However, when Hiram visited the cities, he was displeased with them and called them "Cabul," which means "good for nothing" or "like nothing." 

The exact location and identity of these cities are not specified in the Bible. Some scholars suggest that they may have been located in the northern part of Israel, near the border with Tyre. The story highlights the relationship between Solomon and Hiram, as well as the exchange of resources and territories between their kingdoms. It also shows that not all gifts or transactions were satisfactory to both parties involved.
