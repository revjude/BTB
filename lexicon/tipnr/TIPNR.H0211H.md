Ophir was a region known for its abundant and fine gold, which was highly prized in ancient times. It is mentioned in connection with the wealth and splendor of King Solomon, who received gold from Ophir through his naval expeditions in partnership with Hiram, king of Tyre \(1 Kgs. 9:28; 10:11; 2 Chr. 8:18; 9:10\). The gold of Ophir was renowned for its purity and value, and it was used in the construction and decoration of the temple and royal palaces \(1 Chr. 29:4; 2 Chr. 8:18\). The location of Ophir is uncertain, but scholars have proposed various possibilities, including the Arabian Peninsula, the Horn of Africa, and India. In poetic and prophetic texts, Ophir is used as a symbol of wealth and prosperity \([[Job.22.24|Job 22:24]]; 28:16; Ps. 45:9; Isa. 13:12\).
