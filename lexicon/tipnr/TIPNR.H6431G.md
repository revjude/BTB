Peleth was a Reubenite, the father of On, who was involved in Korah's rebellion against Moses, according to [[Num.16.1|Numbers 16:1]]. Korah, a Levite, led a group of 250 leaders in challenging the authority of Moses and Aaron. On son of Peleth was one of the rebels, along with Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab. However, On is not mentioned again in the story, and some scholars suggest he may have withdrawn from the rebellion. The rebellion was a serious challenge to Moses' leadership and resulted in God's judgment on the rebels. Peleth's mention as On's father highlights the involvement of Reubenites in this significant event.
