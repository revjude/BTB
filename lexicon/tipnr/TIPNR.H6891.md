Zarethan, also known by various spellings such as Zaretan, Zartanah, Zererah, and Zeredah, is a place mentioned in the Bible in connection with several significant events. It is first mentioned in [[Josh.3.16|Joshua 3:16]] as a location near Adam where the waters of the Jordan River were cut off, allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground. Later, in the account of Gideon's pursuit of the Midianites, Zarethan is mentioned as a point of reference \(Judg. 7:22\). During the reign of Solomon, Zarethan is noted as the place where Hiram, a Phoenician craftsman, cast bronze implements for the Temple in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan \(1 Kgs. 7:46; 2 Chr. 4:17\). The city is also mentioned in [[1Kgs.4.12|1 Kings 4:12]] to help locate Beth-Shean, which was in Solomon's fifth administrative district. Although the exact location of Zarethan is uncertain, it is believed to have been situated in the Jordan Valley, possibly on the west bank of the river. Some scholars propose identifying it with Tell el-Mazar \(also known as Qerawa or Korea\) near Mount Sartabe, while others suggest it may have been on the east bank. Regardless of its precise location, Zarethan played a role in significant events in Israel's history, from the miraculous crossing of the Jordan to the construction of Solomon's Temple.
