Immer is mentioned in [[Neh.3.29|Nehemiah 3:29]] as one of the people involved in repairing the wall of Jerusalem. He was responsible for the section of the wall near his house. The text identifies him as "Zadok son of Immer," suggesting he was from a priestly family. Immer worked on the wall alongside other priests, Levites, and laypeople who each took responsibility for a portion. The joint effort to rebuild the wall under Nehemiah's leadership aimed to restore Jerusalem's defenses and security after the Babylonian exile.
