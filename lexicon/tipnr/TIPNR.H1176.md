<small>*Male • A Philistine god worshiped at Ekron.*</small>

Man living at the time of Divided Monarchy

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Baal-zebub</span> was the god of Ekron whom Ahaziah consulted about his illness.
- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at [[2Kgs.1.2|2Ki.1.2]]; 
- only referred to as Baal-zebub **<big>[[H1176|בַּעַל זְבוּב]]</big>**.

Baal-zebub, meaning "Lord of the Flies," was the god of the Philistine city of Ekron. In 2 Kings 1, King Ahaziah of Israel sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub whether he would recover from an illness. This action provoked God's anger, and the prophet Elijah confronted the king, prophesying that he would die for seeking guidance from a pagan god rather than the Lord. The narrative presents Baal-zebub as a false god whose worship was forbidden for Israelites. Consulting this deity was seen as a direct violation of the commandment to worship only the one true God. The passage also demonstrates the futility of trusting in false gods, as Baal-zebub had no power to heal Ahaziah or overturn God's decree of judgment.
