Sachia is briefly mentioned in [[1Chr.8.10|1 Chronicles 8:10]] as one of the sons of Shaharaim, a descendant of Benjamin. The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 8 lists some of the prominent families and individuals within the tribe of Benjamin. Sachia is listed along with his brothers Jeuz, Shachia, and Mirma, who were born to Shaharaim by his wife Hodesh in the country of Moab \(1 Chronicles 8:8-10\). No further information is provided about Sachia or his role within the tribe. His inclusion in the genealogy serves to document the family lines and descendants of Benjamin, the youngest son of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\) and Rachel, whose tribe played a significant role in Israel's history.
