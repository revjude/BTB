<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Vedan</span>, a place of uncertain location, mentioned in Ezekiel's prophecy as trading with Tyre \(Ezek. 27:19\).
- A location only mentioned at [[Ezek.27.19|Ezk.27.19]]; 
- only referred to as Vedan **<big>[[H2051|וְדָן]]</big>**.

Vedan is a place name that appears only once in the Bible, in [[Ezek.27.19|Ezekiel 27:19]], as part of a prophecy against Tyre. The verse mentions Vedan and Javan as trading with yarn for Tyre's wares. The exact location of Vedan is unknown, and the text is considered to be in poor condition. Some scholars suggest that Vedan may be a reference to Dedan, which is mentioned separately in the following verse. Others propose that Vedan could be identified with Waddan, also known as al-'Abwa', a location between Mecca and Medina. However, these identifications remain speculative due to the lack of clear evidence. The mention of Vedan in Ezekiel's prophecy highlights the extensive trade network of Tyre and the various places that engaged in commerce with the city.
