<small>*Male • Paul's friend in Troas*</small>

Man living at the time of the New Testament

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Carpus</span> was a friend of Paul in Troas, with whom Paul left his cloak, books, and parchments.
- A man living at the time of the New Testament, only mentioned at [[2Tim.4.13|2Ti.4.13]]; 
- only referred to as Carpus<[[G2591]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangGreek'>Κάρπος</span>\).

Carpus was a resident of Troas, a city located on the northwest coast of Asia Minor \(modern-day Turkey\). He is mentioned only once in the Bible, in [[2Tim.4.13|2 Timothy 4:13]], where the apostle Paul asks Timothy to bring the cloak, books, and parchments that he had left with Carpus in Troas. This request suggests that Carpus was a trusted friend or associate of Paul, who had provided lodging or assistance to the apostle during his travels. The fact that Paul left important personal belongings with Carpus indicates a level of familiarity and trust between them. Although no further details about Carpus are provided in the Bible, his brief mention in Paul's letter to Timothy offers a glimpse into the network of believers and supporters that sustained Paul's ministry in the early church.
