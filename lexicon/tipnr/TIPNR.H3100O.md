In 1 Chronicles 23, David organizes the Levites and assigns them their duties. Joel is listed as one of the sons of Ladan, a descendant of Gershon. The Gershonites were responsible for the care and transportation of the tabernacle and its furnishings. 

In 1 Chronicles 26, Joel is mentioned again in the context of the gatekeepers and treasurers appointed by David. The sons of Jehieli, including Zetham and Joel, were entrusted with the treasuries of the house of the Lord. This responsibility included managing the dedicated gifts and offerings brought to the temple. Joel's inclusion in these passages highlights the various roles and responsibilities held by the Levites in maintaining the worship and administration of the temple during David's reign.
