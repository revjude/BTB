Gederah is mentioned in the Bible as a town located in the Shephelah, or lowland region, of Judah. It is listed among the towns allotted to the tribe of Judah in [[Josh.15.36|Joshua 15:36]], along with other nearby settlements such as Socoh, Azekah, and Shaaraim. 

In [[1Chr.4.23|1 Chronicles 4:23]], Gederah is described as a place where the potters and those who dwelt among plants and hedges resided, suggesting that the town was known for its pottery production and agricultural activities. 

Gederah is also associated with two individuals who served under King David. In [[1Chr.27.28|1 Chronicles 27:28]], Baal-hanan the Gederite is mentioned as one of David's overseers in charge of the olive and sycamore trees in the Shephelah region, indicating that he likely hailed from Gederah. 

Additionally, in [[1Chr.12.4|1 Chronicles 12:4]], Jozabad the Gederathite is listed among David's mighty men who joined him at Ziklag when he was fleeing from Saul. This suggests that Jozabad was a skilled warrior from Gederah who pledged his allegiance to David. 

The exact location of Gederah is not specified in the Bible, but based on its association with the Shephelah and its proximity to other known towns, it is believed to have been situated in the western foothills of Judah, southwest of Jerusalem.
