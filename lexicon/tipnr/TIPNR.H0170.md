Oholah is a symbolic name used by the prophet Ezekiel to represent Samaria, the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel \(Ezekiel 23:4\). In Ezekiel's allegorical prophecy, Oholah and her sister Oholibah \(representing Jerusalem\) are portrayed as promiscuous women who engaged in idolatry and sought alliances with foreign nations \([[Ezek.23.5|Ezekiel 23:5]]-44\). The name Oholah likely means "her tent," possibly referring to the unauthorized places of worship established in the northern kingdom. Through this allegory, Ezekiel condemns the unfaithfulness of Israel and Judah, highlighting their spiritual adultery and the consequences they would face as a result of their actions.
