People from Dodan\(?\)

The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Dodanim</span> were descendants of Javan, son of Japheth, mentioned in the Table of Nations. \([[Gen.10.4|Gen.10.4]]; [[1Chr.1.7|1Ch.1.7]]\)
- People from Dodan\(?\) of the Greeks, first mentioned at [[Gen.10.4|Gen.10.4]]; 
- referred to as Dodanim or Rodanim \(KJV= Dodanim, NIV= Rodanites\) <[[H1721]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>רו</span>ֹ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ָ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>נ</span>ִ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ים</span>\); 
- descended from Javan<[[H3120G]]> along with Elishah<[[H0473G]]>, Tarshish<[[H8659G]]> and Kittim<[[H3794G]]>.

The Dodanim are mentioned in the Table of Nations in Genesis 10 and 1 Chronicles 1. They are listed as one of the descendants of Javan, the son of Japheth \([[Gen.10.4|Genesis 10:4]]; [[1Chr.1.7|1 Chronicles 1:7]]\). 

Japheth was one of the three sons of Noah, and his descendants are generally associated with the peoples of Europe and Asia Minor. Javan, Japheth's son, is often connected with the ancient Greeks or the Ionians. 

The Dodanim, along with Javan's other descendants \(Elishah, Tarshish, and Kittim\), are thought to represent various peoples or regions within the Greek or Mediterranean world. However, the exact identification of the Dodanim remains uncertain. 

Some scholars suggest that the Dodanim may be associated with the island of Rhodes, located off the coast of Asia Minor. Others propose a connection with the Dardanians, an ancient people who lived in the region of the Dardanelles and Troy. 

It is worth noting that in some manuscripts and translations of [[1Chr.1.7|1 Chronicles 1:7]], the name "Dodanim" is rendered as "Rodanim," which could be a scribal error or may suggest an alternative tradition linking Javan's descendants with the island of Rhodes. 

Apart from these mentions in the Table of Nations, no further information is provided about the Dodanim in the Bible. Their inclusion in the genealogies serves to trace the spread of nations and peoples following the Flood and to establish the connection between Japheth's descendants and the Greek or Mediterranean world.
