Machi is mentioned in the book of Numbers as the father of Geuel, who was one of the twelve scouts sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan \([[Num.13.15|Num.13.15]]\). Each scout was chosen as a leader from their respective tribes, and Geuel represented the tribe of Gad. The scouts were tasked with surveying the land, assessing its fertility, and gathering information about the inhabitants \(Num.13.17-20\). Upon their return, the scouts reported that the land was bountiful but the inhabitants were powerful, which discouraged the Israelites and led to their refusal to enter the land \(Num.13.25-33\). As a result, God condemned the generation to wander in the wilderness for forty years \(Num.14.26-35\).
