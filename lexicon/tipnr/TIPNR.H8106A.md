- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, first mentioned at 1Ki.16.24; 
- only referred to as Shemer<[[H8106A]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ש</span>ֶׁ֫<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>מ</span>ֶ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ר</span>\).

Shemer was the original owner of the hill of Samaria, which would later become the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel. According to 1 Kings 16:24, Omri, the king of Israel, bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver. Omri then built a city on the hill and named it Samaria, after Shemer, the previous owner of the land. This transaction marked the establishment of a new capital for the northern kingdom, which would play a significant role in the history of Israel. Apart from this land sale, no other information is provided about Shemer's life or background.
