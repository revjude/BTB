Shear-jashub, mentioned in [[Isa.7.3|Isaiah 7:3]], was the son of the prophet Isaiah. His name, which means "a remnant shall return," carried a prophetic significance. In the context of the Syro-Ephraimite War, when the kings of Syria and Israel were threatening Judah, God instructed Isaiah to take Shear-jashub and meet King Ahaz. The presence of Shear-jashub served as a reminder of God's promise that a remnant of His people would return and be preserved, despite the impending judgment. The name Shear-jashub embodied the message of hope and restoration that Isaiah proclaimed to Ahaz and the people of Judah. The text does not provide any further details about Shear-jashub's life or his role beyond this symbolic appearance. However, his presence alongside his father Isaiah at this critical moment in Judah's history highlights the importance of the prophetic message and the assurance of God's faithfulness to His covenant people.
