The Valley of Achor was a valley near Jericho where Achan, an Israelite, was stoned to death for taking forbidden plunder from the city of Jericho \([[Josh.7.24|Joshua 7:24]]-26\). As a result, the valley was named "Achor," which means "trouble," because Achan had brought trouble upon Israel. The Valley of Achor is also mentioned as a boundary marker for the tribe of Judah \([[Josh.15.7|Joshua 15:7]]\). 

In later prophetic writings, the Valley of Achor is used symbolically. [[Isa.65.10|Isaiah 65:10]] portrays it as a place of rest and abundance for God's people in the future messianic age. [[Hos.2.15|Hosea 2:15]] describes it as a place of hope and restoration, where God will turn Israel's sorrow into joy, comparing it to a "door of hope." These passages suggest that the Valley of Achor, once a place of judgment and trouble, will become a symbol of God's blessing and redemption for His people.
