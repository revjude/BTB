Parosh is the name of a family that returned to Jerusalem from the Babylonian exile \([[Ezra.2.3|Ezra 2:3]]; [[Neh.7.8|Nehemiah 7:8]]\). The family is mentioned in the lists of the returnees, which suggests that they were a significant group among the exiles who chose to return to their homeland. The return from exile marked a crucial moment in the history of the Jewish people, as it signaled the end of the Babylonian captivity and the beginning of the restoration of Jerusalem and the temple. Some members of the Parosh family were among those who had married foreign women during the exile, which was a violation of God's law \([[Ezra.10.25|Ezra 10:25]]\). This led to a crisis in the community, and the people were required to separate from their foreign wives to maintain the purity of the Israelite nation. The presence of the Parosh family in the lists of returnees and in the account of the marriage crisis highlights the challenges faced by the Jewish community as they sought to rebuild their lives and maintain their identity after the exile.
