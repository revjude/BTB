Migron is mentioned twice in the Bible, first as a place near Gibeah where King Saul camped with his troops during a battle against the Philistines \([[1Sam.14.2|1 Samuel 14:2]]\). Saul was staying under a pomegranate tree in Migron, while his son Jonathan launched a daring attack on a Philistine outpost. 

The second mention of Migron is in Isaiah's prophecy about the Assyrian invasion of Judah \([[Isa.10.28|Isaiah 10:28]]\). In this passage, Migron is listed among the towns that the Assyrian army would pass through on their way to Jerusalem. The exact location of Migron is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated near Gibeah, in the territory of Benjamin, a short distance north of Jerusalem.
