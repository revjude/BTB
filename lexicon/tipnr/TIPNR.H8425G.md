Togarmah is mentioned in [[Gen.10.3|Genesis 10:3]] and [[1Chr.1.6|1 Chronicles 1:6]] as one of the sons of Gomer and grandsons of Japheth. He is listed in the Table of Nations, which records the descendants of Noah's sons after the flood. The descendants of Japheth are generally associated with the peoples of Europe and Asia Minor. Some ancient Jewish traditions and historians have attempted to identify Togarmah with various regions or ethnic groups, such as Armenia or Phrygia, but these connections remain speculative. The mention of Togarmah in the genealogy serves to emphasize the diversity and spread of the nations descended from Noah.
