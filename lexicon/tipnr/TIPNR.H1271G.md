- only referred to as Barzillai **<big>[[H1271|בַּרְזִלַּי]]</big>**.

Barzillai was a wealthy Gileadite from Rogelim who provided essential support to King David during his flight from his son Absalom's rebellion \([[2Sam.17.27|2 Samuel 17:27]]-29\). Along with others, Barzillai generously supplied food and provisions for David and his men. After Absalom's defeat, when David returned to Jerusalem, Barzillai accompanied him to the Jordan River \([[2Sam.19.31|2 Samuel 19:31]]-39\). Due to his advanced age of eighty, Barzillai declined David's invitation to join him in Jerusalem, but he sent his son Chimham in his place. David blessed Barzillai and promised to show kindness to his family. Later, on his deathbed, David instructed Solomon to show favor to Barzillai's descendants \([[1Kgs.2.7|1 Kings 2:7]]\). Barzillai's loyalty and generosity during David's time of need were remembered and honored by the king. In Ezra 2:61 and Nehemiah 7:63, a priestly family is mentioned who traced their lineage to Barzillai, indicating the enduring impact of his devotion to David.
