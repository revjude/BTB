- A man living at the time of Divided Monarchy, only mentioned at [[2Chr.31.15|2Ch.31.15]]; 
- only referred to as Eden<[[H5731G]]> \(<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ע</span>ֵ֫<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ד</span>ֶ<span class='tipnrLangHebrew'>ן</span>\).

Eden is mentioned in [[2Chr.31.15|2 Chronicles 31:15]] as one of the Levites appointed by King Hezekiah to distribute the contributions, tithes, and dedicated gifts to their fellow Levites in their cities. He is listed along with Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah as trustworthy individuals chosen for this task. 

The context of this passage is Hezekiah's reform of the religious practices in Judah. As part of his efforts to restore proper worship, Hezekiah ordered the people to bring their contributions, tithes, and dedicated gifts to the temple \(2 Chronicles 31:4-5\). The response was overwhelming, and the people brought an abundance of offerings \(2 Chronicles 31:6-8\). 

To ensure the fair distribution of these offerings among the Levites and their families, Hezekiah appointed Eden and the other mentioned Levites to oversee the process. They were responsible for distributing the portions to their brethren in their cities, according to the divisions of the Levitical families \([[2Chr.31.15|2 Chronicles 31:15]]-19\). 

The appointment of Eden and the other Levites for this task highlights the importance of organization and fairness in the administration of the temple resources. It also demonstrates Hezekiah's concern for the well-being of the Levites and their families, ensuring that they received their due portions from the offerings. 

Apart from this brief mention, no further information is provided about Eden or his specific role in the distribution process. His inclusion in the narrative emphasizes the Levites' involvement in the practical aspects of temple administration and their role in supporting the religious reforms initiated by King Hezekiah.
