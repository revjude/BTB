Shallum, mentioned in [[Ezra.10.24|Ezra 10:24]], was one of the singers who had married a foreign woman during the time of Ezra. When Ezra led a reform to address the issue of intermarriage among the returned exiles, Shallum was among those who had taken foreign wives. As part of the resolution to this problem, Shallum and the others agreed to put away their foreign wives and children, in accordance with the counsel of Ezra and the leaders. This decision was made to demonstrate their commitment to following God's law and maintaining the purity of the Israelite community.
