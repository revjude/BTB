- A man from the tribe of Judah living at the time of Egypt and Wilderness, first mentioned at [[Num.32.41|Num.32.41]]; 
- referred to as Jair **<big>[[H2971|יָאִיר]]</big>**, or Jairite **<big>[[H2972|יָאִרִי]]</big>**; 
- a son of Segub **<big>[[H7687|שְׂגוּב]]</big>**.

Jair was a descendant of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, who played a significant role in the conquest and settlement of the region east of the Jordan River. According to [[Num.32.41|Numbers 32:41]] and Deuteronomy 3:14, Jair captured the settlements in Gilead and named them Havvoth-jair, which means "the towns of Jair." [[1Chr.2.22|1 Chronicles 2:22]] states that Jair controlled twenty-three cities in Gilead. In [[2Sam.20.26|2 Samuel 20:26]], a person named Ira the Jairite is mentioned as one of David's officials, possibly indicating that Jair's descendants continued to hold influential positions. [[1Kgs.4.13|1 Kings 4:13]] refers to the towns of Jair in the context of Solomon's administrative districts, suggesting that the region remained associated with Jair's name long after his lifetime.
