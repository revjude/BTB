Gedaliah is mentioned in [[Zeph.1.1|Zephaniah 1:1]] as the grandfather of the prophet Zephaniah. Zephaniah's genealogy is traced back four generations to Hezekiah, who was likely the king of Judah known for his religious reforms \(2 Kings 18-20; 2 Chronicles 29-32\). This suggests that Zephaniah came from a prominent family with royal connections. Gedaliah, as Zephaniah's grandfather, would have lived during the reigns of the kings of Judah preceding Josiah, possibly during the time of Manasseh or Amon. No further information is provided about Gedaliah's life or his role in the history of Judah. However, his inclusion in Zephaniah's genealogy serves to establish the prophet's lineage and lend authority to his prophetic ministry. Zephaniah prophesied during the reign of King Josiah \(640-609 BC\) and called for repentance and renewal in the face of impending judgment \(Zephaniah 1:4-6; 2:1-3\). His message played a significant role in the religious reforms initiated by Josiah \(2 Kings 22-23\).
