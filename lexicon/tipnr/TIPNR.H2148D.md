Zechariah is mentioned as one of the chiefs of the tribe of Reuben during the reign of Jotham, king of Judah. He is listed along with Jeiel as a leader of the Reubenites. The tribe of Reuben, along with Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, settled in the region east of the Jordan River. During the reign of Jotham, who was known for his righteous rule, these tribes were recognized as having valiant men, skilled in warfare. Zechariah's inclusion among the chiefs suggests he held a position of authority and responsibility within the tribe of Reuben.
