Eliab, mentioned in [[1Sam.16.6|1 Samuel 16:6]]; 17:13,28; [[1Chr.2.13|1 Chronicles 2:13]]; and [[2Chr.11.18|2 Chronicles 11:18]], was the eldest son of Jesse and the brother of King David. When the prophet Samuel came to anoint one of Jesse's sons as the future king, Eliab was the first to pass before him. However, God instructed Samuel not to judge by appearance, as He had not chosen Eliab \([[1Sam.16.6|1 Samuel 16:6]]-7\). Eliab, along with his brothers, served in Saul's army during the battle against the Philistines. When David visited the camp, Eliab rebuked him, accusing him of neglecting their father's sheep out of pride and curiosity \(1 Samuel 17:28\). Despite this tension, Eliab witnessed David's victory over Goliath and his rise to prominence in Israel. Eliab's daughter, Abihail, later married King Rehoboam, the son of Solomon \([[2Chr.11.18|2 Chronicles 11:18]]\), indicating a continued connection between the families.
