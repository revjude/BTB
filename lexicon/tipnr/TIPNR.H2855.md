Hethlon is mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel as a place situated on the northern border of the restored land of Israel \(Ezek 47:15; 48:1\). In Ezekiel's vision, the northern border extends from the Mediterranean Sea to Hethlon and then continues eastward toward Hamath and Zedad. The exact location of Hethlon is uncertain, but it was likely a significant landmark or settlement in the region of Lebo-hamath, which is associated with the entrance to Hamath, a city in modern-day Syria. Hethlon's mention in Ezekiel's vision emphasizes the extent and boundaries of the ideal, restored land of Israel.
