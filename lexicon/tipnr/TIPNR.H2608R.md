Hananiah is mentioned in [[Ezra.10.28|Ezra 10:28]] as one of the Israelites who had married foreign wives during the time of Ezra. Following Ezra's call for the people to repent and separate themselves from their foreign wives, Hananiah was among those who agreed to do so \(Ezra 10:19\). This action was taken to ensure the purity of the Israelite community and their faithfulness to God's law.
