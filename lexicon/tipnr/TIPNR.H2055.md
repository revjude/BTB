Vaizatha was one of the ten sons of Haman, the chief enemy of the Jews in the book of Esther. Haman plotted to destroy all the Jews in the Persian Empire, but his plan was thwarted by Queen Esther and her cousin Mordecai. After Haman's downfall and execution, the king granted the Jews the right to defend themselves against their enemies. On the appointed day, the Jews defeated those who sought to harm them, and they also killed Haman's ten sons, including Vaizatha. The bodies of Haman's sons were hanged on the gallows, demonstrating the complete defeat of those who opposed the Jewish people.
