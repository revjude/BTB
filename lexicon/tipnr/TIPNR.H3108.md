Jozacar, also known as Zabad, is mentioned in 2 Kings 12:22 and [[2Chr.24.26|2 Chronicles 24:26]] as one of the servants who conspired against and killed King Joash of Judah. The context of the passage is the assassination of Joash and the succession of his son Amaziah \(2 Kings 12:20-21; 2 Chronicles 24:25-27\). 

Jozacar, the son of Shimeath, along with Jehozabad, the son of Shomer, plotted against King Joash and struck him down at Beth-millo \([[2Kgs.12.21|2 Kings 12:21]]; [[2Chr.24.26|2 Chronicles 24:26]]\). The reason for their conspiracy is not explicitly stated, but it may have been related to Joash's earlier abandonment of the Lord's ways and his ordering the execution of the priest Zechariah \(2 Chronicles 24:17-22\). 

After killing Joash, the servants buried him in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings \(2 Chronicles 24:25\). Joash's son Amaziah succeeded him as king \([[2Kgs.12.21|2 Kings 12:21]]; 2 Chronicles 24:27\).
