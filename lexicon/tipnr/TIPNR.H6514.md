Man living at the time of Exile and Return

<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Peruda</span> or Perida, the ancestor of a family of Solomon's servants who returned from the Babylonian exile.
- A man living at the time of Exile and Return, first mentioned at [[Ezra.2.55|Ezr.2.55]]; 
- referred to as Peruda or Perida **<big>[[H6514|פְּרוּדָא]]</big>**.

Peruda, also known as Perida, was the ancestor of a family of Solomon's servants who returned to Judah from the Babylonian exile. The family is mentioned in the lists of returnees in both [[Ezra.2.55|Ezra 2:55]] and [[Neh.7.57|Nehemiah 7:57]]. Solomon's servants were likely descendants of the Canaanites who had been subjected to forced labor during Solomon's reign \(1 Kings 9:20-21\). The return of Peruda's family, along with other families of Solomon's servants, shows that they had maintained their identity and were part of the Jewish community even during the exile. The variations in the name \(Peruda in Ezra and Perida in Nehemiah\) may be due to differences in spelling or transcription.
