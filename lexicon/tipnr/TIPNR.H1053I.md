Beth-shemesh, meaning "house of the sun" in Hebrew, was a fortified city located in the territory allotted to the tribe of Naphtali. This Beth-shemesh is distinct from the cities of the same name in Judah and Issachar. 

In [[Josh.19.38|Joshua 19:38]], Beth-shemesh is listed among the fortified cities in Naphtali's inheritance, along with other cities such as Ziddim, Zer, and Hazor. The inclusion of Beth-shemesh in this list suggests that it was a significant city with defensive structures and walls. 

Judges 1:33 reveals that the tribe of Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath, and the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in the land. However, when Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor but did not drive them out completely. 

The exact location of Beth-shemesh in Naphtali is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the northern part of Canaan, in the region known as the Galilee. The Galilee was known for its fertile land, abundant water sources, and strategic importance due to its proximity to major trade routes. 

No other information about this Beth-shemesh is provided in the Bible, and it is not mentioned in any other historical or archaeological context. Its name, "house of the sun," may refer to the presence of a shrine or temple dedicated to the sun god, or it could be related to a local geographical feature.
