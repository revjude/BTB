Beor was the father of Bela, who was one of the early kings of Edom before any Israelite king reigned \(Gen. 36:32; 1 Ch. 1:43\). Edom was a nation located south of the Dead Sea, descended from Esau, brother of Israel \(or 'Jacob'\). The mention of Beor in the genealogy of Edomite kings suggests that he was a significant figure in Edomite history, although no further details about his life are provided in the Bible.
