People from Meunit\(?\)

The <span class='tipnrhighlight'>Meunites</span> were a people group who lived near Israel and were enemies of God's people \([[1Chr.4.41|1Ch.4.41]]; [[2Chr.26.7|2Ch.26.7]]; 20.1\).
- People from Meunit\(?\) of the Canaanites, first mentioned at [[1Chr.4.41|1Ch.4.41]]; 
- referred to as Meunites or Meunite \(KJV= Mehunite\)  **<big>[[H4586|מְעוּנִי]]</big>**, or Meunite \(KJV= "beside"\)  **<big>[[H5984|עַמּוֹנִי]]</big>**.

The Meunites are mentioned in the books of Chronicles as a people group who lived in the vicinity of Israel and were enemies of God's people. In the time of King Hezekiah, the Simeonites attacked and defeated the Meunites, destroying their tents and dwellings \([[1Chr.4.41|1Ch.4.41]]\). Later, during the reign of King Uzziah, God helped him against the Meunites \([[2Chr.26.7|2Ch.26.7]]\). In the days of King Jehoshaphat, the Meunites joined with the Moabites and Ammonites to attack Judah, but God caused them to turn against each other, resulting in their defeat \([[2Chr.20.1|2Ch.20.1]], 22-23\). The exact location and origin of the Meunites are not specified in the Bible, but they appear to have been a nomadic or semi-nomadic people who lived in the regions east and south of Israel.
