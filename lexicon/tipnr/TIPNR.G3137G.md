Mary, the mother of Jesus, was a young Jewish woman from Nazareth betrothed to Joseph, a descendant of David. Before their marriage, an angel appeared to Mary, announcing that she would conceive a child by the Holy Spirit and name Him Jesus. Mary humbly accepted this divine plan, and the virgin birth of Jesus fulfilled the prophecy of the Messiah \([[Matt.1.16|Matthew 1:16]], 18, 20; Luke 1:26-38\). After Jesus' birth in Bethlehem, Mary and Joseph presented Him at the temple, where Simeon prophesied that a sword would pierce her soul \([[Luke.2.5|Luke 2:5]], 16, 19, 34\). Mary treasured these events in her heart. She and Joseph raised Jesus in Nazareth, and He was known as the son of Mary \([[Matt.13.55|Matthew 13:55]]; [[Mark.6.3|Mark 6:3]]\). During Jesus' crucifixion, Mary stood near the cross with other women, including her sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene \(Matthew 27:56, 61; Mark 15:40, 47\). After Jesus' resurrection, Mary was among the women who went to the tomb and later informed the disciples \(Matthew 28:1; Mark 16:1; Luke 24:10\). In the early church, Mary joined the disciples in prayer as they awaited the coming of the Holy Spirit \(Acts 1:14\).
