Solomon, also known as Jedidiah, was the son of King David and Bathsheba, and the third king of Israel \([[2Sam.12.24|2 Samuel 12:24]]; [[1Chr.3.5|1 Chronicles 3:5]]\). He was born in Jerusalem and named Solomon by his parents, but the prophet Nathan called him Jedidiah, which means "beloved of the Lord" \([[2Sam.12.25|2 Samuel 12:25]]\). 

Solomon ascended to the throne after his father David's death, following a power struggle with his older brother Adonijah \(1 Kings 1-2\). As king, Solomon prayed for wisdom to govern his people, and God granted him exceptional wisdom, understanding, and knowledge \([[1Kgs.3.1|1 Kings 3:1]]-15; [[2Chr.1.1|2 Chronicles 1:1]]-12\). His wisdom was demonstrated through his fair judgments, such as the famous case of the two women claiming the same baby \([[1Kgs.3.1|1 Kings 3:1]]6-28\). 

During his reign, Solomon undertook ambitious construction projects, most notably the building of the First Temple in Jerusalem, which took seven years to complete \(1 Kings 6; 2 Chronicles 3-4\). He also built a palace for himself, fortified cities, and established a strong military force \(1 Kings 7; 9:15-19; 10:26-29; [[2Chr.8.1|2 Chronicles 8:1]]-6; 9:25-28\). 

Solomon's reign was marked by prosperity, wealth, and international recognition. He formed alliances with neighboring kingdoms, engaged in extensive trade, and received tribute from foreign rulers \(1 Kings 5; 9:26-28; 10:1-29; [[2Chr.8.1|2 Chronicles 8:1]]7-18; 9:1-28\). The Queen of Sheba visited Solomon to test his wisdom and left impressed by his knowledge and the splendor of his court \([[1Kgs.10.1|1 Kings 10:1]]-13; 2 Chronicles 9:1-12\). 

However, Solomon's later years were marked by a decline in his faithfulness to God. He married many foreign women and allowed their religious practices to influence him, leading to the worship of false gods \([[1Kgs.11.1|1 Kings 11:1]]-8\). As a result, God declared that the kingdom would be divided after Solomon's death \([[1Kgs.11.9|1 Kings 11:9]]-13\). 

Solomon is traditionally credited with authoring several biblical books, including Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Solomon \(Proverbs 1:1; Ecclesiastes 1:1; Song of Solomon 1:1\). His wisdom and proverbs were widely celebrated and studied \([[1Kgs.4.29|1 Kings 4:29]]-34; Proverbs 1:1; 10:1; 25:1\). 

After a reign of forty years, Solomon died and was succeeded by his son Rehoboam \([[1Kgs.11.4|1 Kings 11:4]]1-43; [[2Chr.9.29|2 Chronicles 9:29]]-31\). As prophesied, the kingdom was divided into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah shortly after his death \(1 Kings 12; 2 Chronicles 10\).
