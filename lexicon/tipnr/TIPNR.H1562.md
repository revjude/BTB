Gilalai is mentioned briefly in [[Neh.12.36|Nehemiah 12:36]] as one of the priests and musicians who participated in the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah. After the completion of the wall's reconstruction, Nehemiah organized a grand dedication ceremony, which involved two large choirs proceeding along the top of the wall in opposite directions, praising God with singing and musical instruments \(Nehemiah 12:27-43\). Gilalai is listed among the priests who played trumpets during this ceremony, along with Zechariah, Azarel, Milalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani. The mention of Gilalai in this context highlights the importance of music and worship in the celebration of significant events in the life of the Jewish community, as well as the role of priests in leading these celebrations.
