<span class='tipnrhighlight'>Elon</span> the Zebulunite judged Israel for ten years \([[Judg.12.11|Jdg.12.11]],12\).
- A Judge living before Israel's Monarchy, first mentioned at [[Judg.12.11|Jdg.12.11]]; 
- only referred to as Elon **<big>[[H0356|אֵילוֹן]]</big>**.

Elon the Zebulunite is mentioned in the book of Judges as one of the judges who led Israel after the death of Jephthah. He judged Israel for a period of ten years \([[Judg.12.11|Jdg.12.11]]\). The text provides minimal information about Elon's life and his role as a judge. It is mentioned that he was from the tribe of Zebulun, indicating his tribal affiliation. The judges in Israel were leaders who served as military commanders, deliverers, and administrators of justice during the period between the conquest of Canaan and the establishment of the monarchy. Elon's ten-year tenure suggests a period of relative stability and peace during his leadership. After his death, Elon was buried in Aijalon, within the territory of Zebulun \([[Judg.12.12|Jdg.12.12]]\). The brevity of the account of Elon's judgeship may indicate that his rule was less eventful compared to some of the other judges mentioned in the book. Nonetheless, his inclusion in the list of judges highlights the continuity of leadership and the role of the tribe of Zebulun in the governance of Israel during this period.
