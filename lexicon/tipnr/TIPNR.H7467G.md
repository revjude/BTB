Reuel was one of the sons of Esau, Jacob's brother, and Basemath, the daughter of Ishmael \([[Gen.36.4|Genesis 36:4]], 10, 13, 17; [[1Chr.1.35|1 Chronicles 1:35]], 37\). He was born in Canaan before Esau moved his family to the hill country of Seir, which later became known as Edom \(Genesis 36:8-9\). Reuel became one of the chiefs of Edom, indicating that he held a position of authority and influence among the Edomites \(Genesis 36:17; [[1Chr.1.37|1 Chronicles 1:37]]\). His sons were Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah \([[Gen.36.13|Genesis 36:13]], 17; [[1Chr.1.37|1 Chronicles 1:37]]\). The Edomites, descendants of Esau, lived in the region south of the Dead Sea and were often in conflict with the Israelites throughout their history. The mention of Reuel and his descendants in the genealogies of Esau demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promise to make Esau into a nation \(Genesis 25:23\) and provides insight into the early history and leadership of the Edomites.
