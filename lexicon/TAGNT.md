#### FIELD DESCRIPTIONS:																															

Reference: Versification as used by NRSV. 

Differences are marked in **square brackets for KJV**, **bround brackets for NA** and **curley brackets for others**. 

**NA is rarely different** \(Mrk.12.15; Act.13.39; Rom.3.26\), but 

**KJV often differs** \(Mat.17.14; 20.4; Mrk.3.19; Luk.1.74; 6.17; 7.19; Act.2.10; 3.19; 4.6; 5.40; 9.29; 19.41; 24.18; Rom.7.9; 9.11; 2Co.1.6; 8.13; 10.5; 13.13; 13.14; Gal.2.20; Eph.1.11; 2.15; 5.13; Php.2.8; Col.1.21; 1Th.1.3; 2.6; 2.11; Heb.3.9; 7.21; 12.23; 1Pe.3.15; Rev.2.27; 13.1; 17.10\). 

Those for **others** are mostly from the Majority text \(ie the NT of the Greek-speaking Orthodox church - at Mat.15.6; Rom.16.25-27; 2Co.1.7; Eph.1.10; Col.1.12 \) and a few modern Bibles \(John.8.1; Col.1.12; 2Th.8.7; 1Tim.6.21\);

**Word Type** Indicates where the word is found: N=Greek in Nestlé-Aland editions which as used by most modern translators, K=Greek used by the KJV translators based on Scrivener 1894; O=other Greek found in major editions but rarely translated. 
	See Abbreviations below for more details.  	

**Greek** Spelling comes from NA28 when available, then from TR or the Other edition that has the word. Cases and final accents are based on the punctuation which follows THGHT. Text follows NA27 which is followed by almost all translations, as tested by the significant variant οὐχ, “not” at the end of 2Pet.3.10 															

**English** Based on Berean Study Bible, with permission, as at 1-July02019 and adapted for this work. 															

**dStrong** - Backwardly compatible with standard Strongs and NASB tagging, as defined in the Brief Lexicon at https://STEPBible.github.io/STEPBible-Data/. Disambiguated as described at TinyURL.com/STEP-Disambiguated															

**Grammar** Based on James Tuaber, with addtional details by Tyndale scholars: persons added to Personal, Reflexive and Possessive pronouns; distinguish 2nd verbal forms \(e.g. 2nd Aorist\); distinguished betweeen "Passive", "Either middle or Passive", "Deponent"

Dictionary form & Gloss	From the TBESG - Tyndale Brief lexicon of Extended Strongs for Greek at https://STEPBible.github.io/STEPBible-Data/															

**Variants** Includes every variant in the major editions and manuscript variants before AD 500 that are used by translators  															

**Spanish** Based on  Marvel Bible Project as on 9-Jan-2019 from https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenGNT/blob/master/OpenGNT\_BASE\_TEXT.zip &  OpenGNT\_keyedFeatures.csv.zip. This is expanded from the source which was available only for words in NA28. 															

**Sub-meanings** Words with more than one meaning are supplied with a context-sensitive sub-meaning. Individuals and Places are identified as in TIPNR. Other are based on CSG \(Context Sensitive Gloss\) from Marvel Bible Project as at 9-Jan-2019 from https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenGNT/blob/master/OpenGNT\_BASE\_TEXT.zip &  OpenGNT\_keyedFeatures.csv.zip															

**Conjoined data** Links for words that might not be translated \(eg articles and particles\) to the word they are gramatically connected to, which may precede them \(marked as «\) or succeed them \(marked »\). sometimes with several intervening words. 															

**sStrong+Instance** Simple Strongs \(sStrongs\) are the numbers found in simpler tagged BIbles - ie without the letters added by NASB tagging or STEPBible disambiguation. 															
	Instances mark more than one occurrence of the same sStrong in the same verse: "\_A" is appended for the 1st instance  \(eg G1234\_A\), "\_B" for the 2nd instance etc. A lower case \(eg "\_b"\) indicates the word may not be included in some tagged Bibles, because it is not found in all manuscripts or because there is also an alternate way to tag this word. 															

**Alt Strongs** Alternate ways to tag the same word using Strongs tags. Differences can be due to variants, joined words \(eg κἀγώ can be tagged as G2532 + G1473 or G2504\) or tags for common forms of the same word \(eg 'he is' and 'they are' instead of 'to be'\)															
	Instances here and for sStrong help line up this data with other tagged Bibles - see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wVZPX1ROtUt53Ur5bkzKcDjKwwynbqOl-ZMpokX0R3Q/preview															

**Variant Notes**	"v"=Variant - when some manuscripts have significantly different wording. "^"=Extra text - when some manuscripts have text not found in others. Manuscript readings that are translated by the KJV are labelled "traditional"; those that agree with NA27 are labelled "older"; and others are labelled as "a few". 															
	
	Insignificant manuscript differences are not noted - ie those which only change spelling, or re-order of the words without changing the meaning, or don't change the way the text is translated, or the editions consider to be a scribal error or eccentricity and therefore not a possible reading of the original text. 															
	
	When more than one word is involved, a "v" or "^" marks each word and the note is placed on the last one. 															

																
### Abbreviations for sources of each word: 																

- **NKO** Indicates that all editions include the same vocabulary and grammar, though the spelling may sometimes vary
- **N** words found in NA27 expressed in the spelling of NA28, which is used by most modern translators																
- **K=KJV** translators' text based on the 'Textus Receptus' \(TR\) of Scrivener’s 1894 with some corrections when the KJV translation sometimes follows a different Greek text. 																
- **O=Other** extra words and variants that are used by neither the KJV nor most modern translations. 																
- **Brackets** indicate a variant. Lower case is used when a difference in vocabulary or grammar is too minor to necessarily affect the translation - 
$\quad$ *eg N\(k\)O indicates NA27/28 has the same Greek as other editions, though the text behind the KJV is different in a minor way that may not be evident as a different translation*libph
