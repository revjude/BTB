→ SYMBOLS USED IN

→ ALAMOTH

- (Literally virgins) .A musical term which appears in [[1Chr.15.20|1Ch 15:20]]

- And in the title of [[Ps.46.1|Ps 46:1]]

- (It seems to indicate the rendering of the song by female voices, possibly soprano) -AL-TASCHITH

- It appears in the titles of [[Ps.57.1|Ps 57:1]]; [[Ps.58.1|58:1]]; [[Ps.59.1|59:1]]; [[Ps.75.1|75:1]]

- (it seems to have been used to indicate the kind of ode, or the  kind of melody in which the ode should be sung.)

→ HIGGAION [[Ps.92.3|Ps 92:3]]

- (According to Gesenius, it signifies the murmuring tone of a  harp, and hence that the music should be rendered in a plaintive manner.) [[Ps.9.16|Ps 9:16]]

- (Combined with &#8220;Selah,&#8221; it may have been intended to indicate  a pause in the vocal music while the instruments rendered an interlude.) [[Ps.19.14|Ps 19:14]]

- (Mendelssohn translates it &#8220;meditation, thought.&#8221; Hence, the  music was to be rendered in a mode to promote devout meditation.)

→ MAKALATH, MASCHIL, LEANNOTH

- These terms are found in the titles of [[Ps.53.1|Ps 53:1]]; [[Ps.88.1|88:1]]

- (Authorities grope in darkness as to their signification. They  may indicate the instruments to be played, or the melody to be sung)

→ MASCHIL

- This musical sign occurs in the titles of [[Ps.32.1|Ps 32:1]]; [[Ps.42.1|42:1]]; [[Ps.44.1|44:1]]; [[Ps.45.1|45:1]]; [[Ps.52.1|52:1]]; [[Ps.53.1|53:1]]; [[Ps.54.1|54:1]]; [[Ps.55.1|55:1]]; [[Ps.74.1|74:1]]; [[Ps.78.1|78:1]]; [[Ps.88.1|88:1]]; [[Ps.89.1|89:1]]; [[Ps.142.1|142:1]]

- (The meaning is obscure. But its signification where it occurs  elsewhere than in the titles of Psalms is equivalent to the English word &#8220;instruction,&#8221; or to become wise by instruction; hence, [[Ps.47.7|Ps 47:7]]: &#8220;Sing ye praises with understanding.&#8221;)

→ MICAHTAM

- A musical term in the titles of [[Ps.16.1|Ps 16:1]]; [[Ps.56.1|56:1]]; [[Ps.57.1|57:1]]; [[Ps.58.1|58:1]]; [[Ps.59.1|59:1]]; [[Ps.60.1|60:1]]

- (Luther interprets this as &#8220;golden,&#8221; that is, &#8220;precious.&#8221; Ewald  interprets it as signifying a plaintive manner.)

→ MUTH-LABBEN

- In the title of [[Ps.9.1|Ps 9:1]]

- (Authorities, ancient and modern, differ as to the probable signification.  Gesenius and De Wette interpret it, &#8220;with the voice of virgins, by boys.&#8221; Others  derive the word from a different Hebrew root, and interpret it as indicating that  the Psalm was a funeral ode.)

→ NEGINAH and NEGINOTH

- Appear in the titles of [[Ps.4.1|Ps 4:1]]; [[Ps.54.1|54:1]]; [[Ps.55.1|55:1]]; [[Ps.61.1|61:1]]; [[Ps.67.1|67:1]]; [[Hab.3.19|Hab 3:19]]

- (Its use seems to have been to indicate that the song should  be accompanied by stringed instruments.) -NEHILOTH

- Appears in the title of [[Ps.5.1|Ps 5:1]]

- (It seems to indicate, according to Gesenius, that when this  Psalm was sung it was to be accompanied by wind instruments.) -SELAH

- (This term appears frequently in the Psalms. Its use is not known.  Possibly it signified a pause in the vocal music while an instrumental interlude or finale was rendered.)

→ SHEMINITH

- In the titles of [[Ps.6.1|Ps 6:1]]; [[Ps.12.1|12:1]]

- (Translated &#8220;eighth,&#8221; probably indicates the measure, movement, or pitch.)

→ SHIGGAION

- In the title of [[Ps.7.1|Ps 7:1]]

- And its plural, SHIGIONOTH, in the title of [[Hab.3.1|Hab 3:1]]

- (Supposed to be a musical term to guide in rendering the song.  At the close of the chapter, the author refers the ode &#8220;to the chief musician, on  my stringed instruments.&#8221; The term may suggest the movement in interpreting the  music set to it.)

→ SHOSHANNIM and SHUSHAN-EDUTH .In the titles to [[Ps.45.1|Ps 45:1]]; [[Ps.60.1|60:1]]; [[Ps.69.1|69:1]]; [[Ps.80.1|80:1]]

- (Seems to indicate the manner in which these Psalms were to be  rendered. Kimchi, Tremellius, and Eichhorn render it &#8220;hexachorda,&#8221; that is, that  in singing these Psalms instruments of six strings were to accompany.)
