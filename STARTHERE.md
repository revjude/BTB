# How This Bible Works

### Chapter View

- Chapters are formatted in paragraphs, and meant for when reading more than a verse at a time.
- In 1769, \[the words you see in brackets\] were added to the original 1611 edition of the King James Bible.
- **For a more poetic experience:** Skip the bracketed words. The original translation was intended for public reading aloud, thus the shorter clauses with added punctuation.
- **For a more literal understanding:** Read *with* the bracketed words to experience the scripture as it would have been intended for the audience of the original author.
- If you get stuck on understanding, hover over the verse number to see a more modern translation that could get you un-stuck.
- If a verse grabs your attention, click the verse number to study it in a detailed Verse View...

### Verse View

Individual verses show you:

- **KJV text** (majority text tradition)
- **BSB text** (critical text tradition) for comparison
- **Interlinear breakdown** - every word linked to its original Hebrew/Aramaic/Greek
- **Hover over any original language word** to see the lexical entry for that word, which helps develop a finer image in your mind of how that word should be understood when translating it into English.
- **Translator's notes** explain textual variants between source manuscripts

### Lexicon

- Each lexicon entry is compiled from all available sources of information about that particular word.
- Every entry provides the literal English translation of the root word (called a gloss) and a full definition.
- Entries include extended, disambiguated information where relevant—for example, biographical details about specific individuals, or contextual notes explaining how a word functions in particular usage.
- Full lexicon entries are included from Abbott-Smith, Brown-Driver-Briggs, and LSJ, with all references linked so you can develop a fuller understanding of how each word is used throughout the Bible and other ancient sources.
- Location entries include embedded Google Maps when referring to specific places. To use this feature, obtain a [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript), then use VS Code to find and replace `[GoogleAPIKey]` with your key in the TIPNR directory within the lexicon folder.
