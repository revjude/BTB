**LXX 2 Samuel 14:25** 
<small><sub>**LXX:**</sub></small>
And there was no man as Absalom in all Israel exceedingly praiseworthy. From \[the\] sole of his foot and unto \[the\] top of his \[head\] -- there was not a blemish on him. 
<small><sub>**KJV:**</sub></small>
But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
<small><sub>**BSB:**</sub></small>
Now there was not a man in all Israel as handsome and highly praised as Absalom. From the sole of his foot to the top of his head, he did not have a single flaw.<small><sub>**MT:**</sub></small>
