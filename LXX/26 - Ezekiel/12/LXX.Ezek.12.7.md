**LXX Ezekiel 12:7** 
<small><sub>**LXX:**</sub></small>
And I did so according to all as much as he gave charge to me. And I brought forth items for \[the\] day of captivity, and at evening I dug through the wall myself by hand; and being hidden I came forth; I was taken up upon a shoulder in the presence of them. 
<small><sub>**KJV:**</sub></small>
And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought [it] forth in the twilight, [and] I bare [it] upon [my] shoulder in their sight.
<small><sub>**BSB:**</sub></small>
So I did as I was commanded. I brought out my bags for exile by day, and in the evening I dug through the wall by hand. I took my belongings out at dusk, carrying them on my shoulder as they watched.<small><sub>**MT:**</sub></small>
