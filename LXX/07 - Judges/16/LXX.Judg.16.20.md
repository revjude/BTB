***Samson Is Taken Captive and Blinded***

<small><sub>**LXX:**</sub></small>
And Delilah said, \[The\] Philistines \[are\] upon you, Samson. And he was awakened from out of  his sleep. And he said, I shall go forth, and I shall do as continually \[before\], and I shall brush myself off. And he did not know that the <span class="smallcaps">lord</span> left from him. 
<small><sub>**KJV:**</sub></small>
And she said, The Philistines [be] upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.
<small><sub>**BSB:**</sub></small>
Then she called out, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” When Samson awoke from his sleep, he thought, “I will escape as I did before and shake myself free.” But he did not know that the LORD had departed from him.<small><sub>**MT:**</sub></small>
