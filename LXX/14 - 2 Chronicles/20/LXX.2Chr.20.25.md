**LXX 2 Chronicles 20:25** 
<small><sub>**LXX:**</sub></small>
And Jehoshaphat came forth, and  his people, to despoil  their spoils. And they found much cattle, and belongings, and spoils, and desirable items. And they despoiled for themselves. And they were three days plundering the spoils, for there was much. 
<small><sub>**KJV:**</sub></small>
And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.
<small><sub>**BSB:**</sub></small>
Then Jehoshaphat and his people went to carry off the plunder, and they found on the bodies an abundance of goods and valuables—more than they could carry away. They were gathering the plunder for three days because there was so much.<small><sub>**MT:**</sub></small>
