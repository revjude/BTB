even thrusting away  his covenant, and the ordinances which he ordained \[with\] their fathers, and  his testimonies, as many as he testified to them; and they went after the vain \[things\], and acted in folly, and \[followed\] after the nations  surrounding them, which \[the\] <span class="smallcaps">lord</span> gave charge to them  to not do according to these \[things\]. 
<small><sub>**KJV:**</sub></small>
And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that [were] round about them, [concerning] whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them.
<small><sub>**BSB:**</sub></small>
They rejected His statutes and the covenant He had made with their fathers, as well as the decrees He had given them. They pursued worthless idols and became worthless themselves, going after the surrounding nations that the LORD had commanded them not to imitate.<small><sub>**MT:**</sub></small>
