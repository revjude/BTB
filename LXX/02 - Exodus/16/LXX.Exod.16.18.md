<small><sub>**LXX:**</sub></small>
And measuring \[with\] the homer, the one which \[had\] much was not superabundant, and \[the one\] which  had less had not too less, for each  collected together \[what was\] fitting for himself. 
<small><sub>**KJV:**</sub></small>
And when they did mete [it] with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.
<small><sub>**BSB:**</sub></small>
When they measured it by the omer, he who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no shortfall. Each one gathered as much as he needed to eat.<small><sub>**MT:**</sub></small>
