**LXX Daniel 8:25** 
<small><sub>**LXX:**</sub></small>
And the yoke of the collar shall prosper; treachery in his hand, and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by treachery he shall corrupt many, and for a destruction of many he shall establish himself; and as eggs in a hand he shall break. 
<small><sub>**KJV:**</sub></small>
And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify [himself] in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.
<small><sub>**BSB:**</sub></small>
Through his craft and by his hand, he will cause deceit to prosper, and in his own mind he will make himself great. In a time of peace he will destroy many, and he will even stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be broken off, but not by human hands.<small><sub>**MT:**</sub></small>
