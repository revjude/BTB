<small><sub>**LXX:**</sub></small>
And they overtook it, and struck it by \[the\] mouth of \[the\] sword, and  its king, and  all its villages, and every one  breathing, as many as was in it. There was not one surviving. In which manner they did \[to\] Eglon, also they utterly destroyed it and all breathing, as much as \[was\] in it. 
<small><sub>**KJV:**</sub></small>
And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that [were] therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that [were] therein.
<small><sub>**BSB:**</sub></small>
They captured it and put to the sword its king, all its villages, and all the people. Joshua left no survivors, just as he had done at Eglon; he devoted to destruction Hebron and everyone in it.<small><sub>**MT:**</sub></small>
