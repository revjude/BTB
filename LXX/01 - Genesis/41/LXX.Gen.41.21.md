**LXX Genesis 41:21** 
<small><sub>**LXX:**</sub></small>
And they entered into  their bellies. And it did not become apparent that they entered into  their bellies. And  their appearance \[was\] shameful, as also in the beginning. And \[after\] awakening, I went \[back\] to bed. 
<small><sub>**KJV:**</sub></small>
And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they [were] still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
<small><sub>**BSB:**</sub></small>
When they had devoured them, however, no one could tell that they had done so; their appearance was as ugly as it had been before. Then I awoke.<small><sub>**MT:**</sub></small>
