<small><sub>**LXX:**</sub></small>
And removing the garments of the widowhood from herself, she put around a lightweight covering, and bedecked \[herself\], and sat by the gates of Enaim, which is in \[the\] byway of Timnath. For she knew that Shelah was older, but he did not give her to him as wife. 
<small><sub>**KJV:**</sub></small>
And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which [is] by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.
