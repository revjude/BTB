**LXX Jeremiah 49:10** 
<small><sub>**LXX:**</sub></small>
For I dragged down  Esau; I uncovered  their hidden \[things\]; in no way shall they be able to hide; they were destroyed by \[the\] hand of his brother, and his neighbor; and he is not. 
<small><sub>**KJV:**</sub></small>
But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he [is] not.
<small><sub>**BSB:**</sub></small>
But I will strip Esau bare; I will uncover his hiding places, and he will be unable to conceal himself. His descendants will be destroyed along with his relatives and neighbors, and he will be no more.<small><sub>**MT:**</sub></small>
