**LXX Jeremiah 18:4** 
<small><sub>**LXX:**</sub></small>
And the vessel failed which he was making with  his hands. And again he made it \[into\] another vessel as was pleasing before him  to make. 
<small><sub>**KJV:**</sub></small>
And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make [it].
<small><sub>**BSB:**</sub></small>
But the vessel that he was shaping from the clay became flawed in his hand; so he formed it into another vessel, as it seemed best for him to do.<small><sub>**MT:**</sub></small>
