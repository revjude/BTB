**LXX Jeremiah 6:15** 
<small><sub>**LXX:**</sub></small>
They were shamed for they failed; but neither as ones being disgraced were they disgraced; and  their dishonor they knew not. On account of this they shall fall in  their downfall, and in time of their visitation they shall perish, said \[the\] <span class="smallcaps">lord</span>. 
<small><sub>**KJV:**</sub></small>
Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time [that] I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.
<small><sub>**BSB:**</sub></small>
Are they ashamed of the abomination they have committed? No, they have no shame at all; they do not even know how to blush. So they will fall among the fallen; when I punish them, they will collapse,” says the LORD.<small><sub>**MT:**</sub></small>
