[[Josh.15|Joshua 15:13 - Joshua 15:19]]
*Caleb’s Portion and Conquest*

[[Josh.15.13|13]] And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, \[even\] the city of Arba the father of Anak, which \[city is\] Hebron.

13: 

[[Josh.15.14|14]] And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.

14: 

[[Josh.15.15|15]] And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before \[was\] Kirjathsepher.

15: 

[[Josh.15.16|16]] And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

16: 

[[Josh.15.17|17]] And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

17: 

[[Josh.15.18|18]] And it came to pass, as she came \[unto him\], that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off \[her\] ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?

18: 

[[Josh.15.19|19]] Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.

19:
