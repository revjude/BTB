[[Josh.19.40|40]] \[And\] the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families.

[[Josh.19.41|41]] And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Irshemesh,

41: 

[[Josh.19.42|42]] And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,

42: 

[[Josh.19.43|43]] And Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron,

43:

46: 

[[Josh.19.47|47]] And the coast of the children of Dan went out \[too little\] for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.

47: 

[[Josh.19.48|48]] This \[is\] the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
