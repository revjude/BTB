[[Josh.19|Joshua 19:10 - Joshua 19:16]]
*Zebulun’s Inheritance*

[[Josh.19.10|10]] And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families: and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid:

10: 

[[Josh.19.11|11]] And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that \[is\] before Jokneam;

11: 

[[Josh.19.12|12]] And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chislothtabor, and then goeth out to Daberath, and goeth up to Japhia,

12: 

[[Josh.19.13|13]] And from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittahhepher, to Ittahkazin, and goeth out to Remmonmethoar to Neah;

13: 

[[Josh.19.14|14]] And the border compasseth it on the north side to Hannathon: and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthahel:

14: 

[[Josh.19.15|15]] And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.

15: 

[[Josh.19.16|16]] This \[is\] the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.
