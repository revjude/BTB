[[Josh.19|Joshua 19:49 - Joshua 19:51]]
*Joshua’s Inheritance*

[[Josh.19.49|49]] When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them:

49: 

[[Josh.19.50|50]] According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, \[even\] Timnathserah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt therein.

50: 

[[Josh.19.51|51]] These \[are\] the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing the country.

51:
