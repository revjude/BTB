[[Josh.7|Joshua 7:16 - Joshua 7:26]]
*The Sin of Achan*

[[Josh.7.16|16]] So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:

16: 

[[Josh.7.17|17]] And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:

17: 

[[Josh.7.18|18]] And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.

18: 

[[Josh.7.19|19]] And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide \[it\] not from me.

19: 

[[Josh.7.20|20]] And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:

20: 

[[Josh.7.21|21]] When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they \[are\] hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.

21: 

[[Josh.7.22|22]] So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, \[it was\] hid in his tent, and the silver under it.

22: 

[[Josh.7.23|23]] And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.

23: 

[[Josh.7.24|24]] And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.

24: 

[[Josh.7.25|25]] And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.

25: 

[[Josh.7.26|26]] And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.

26:
