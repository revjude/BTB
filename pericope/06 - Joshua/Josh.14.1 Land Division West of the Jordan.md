*Land Division West of the Jordan*

[[Josh.14.1|1]] And these \[are the countries\] which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.

1: 

[[Josh.14.2|2]] By lot \[was\] their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and \[for\] the half tribe.

2: 

[[Josh.14.3|3]] For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.

3: 

[[Josh.14.4|4]] For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell \[in\], with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance.

4: 

[[Josh.14.5|5]] As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.

5:
