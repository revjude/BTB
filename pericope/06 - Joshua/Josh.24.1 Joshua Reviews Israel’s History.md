[[Josh.24|Joshua 24:1 - Joshua 24:13]]
*Joshua Reviews Israel’s History*

[[Josh.24.1|1]] And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.

1: 

[[Josh.24.2|2]] And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, \[even\] Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.

2: 

[[Josh.24.3|3]] And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.

3: 

[[Josh.24.4|4]] And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.

4: 

[[Josh.24.5|5]] I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.

5: 

[[Josh.24.6|6]] And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.

6: 

[[Josh.24.7|7]] And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.

7: 

[[Josh.24.8|8]] And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.

8: 

[[Josh.24.9|9]] Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:

9: 

[[Josh.24.10|10]] But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.

10: 

[[Josh.24.11|11]] And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.

11: 

[[Josh.24.12|12]] And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, \[even\] the two kings of the Amorites; \[but\] not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.

12: 

[[Josh.24.13|13]] And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.

13:
