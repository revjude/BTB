[[Josh.10|Joshua 10:16 - Joshua 10:28]]
*The Victory at Makkedah*

[[Josh.10.16|16]] But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.

16: 

[[Josh.10.17|17]] And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.

17: 

[[Josh.10.18|18]] And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:

18: 

[[Josh.10.19|19]] And stay ye not, \[but\] pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.

19: 

[[Josh.10.20|20]] And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest \[which\] remained of them entered into fenced cities.

20: 

[[Josh.10.21|21]] And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.

21: 

[[Josh.10.22|22]] Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.

22: 

[[Josh.10.23|23]] And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, \[and\] the king of Eglon.

23: 

[[Josh.10.24|24]] And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.

24: 

[[Josh.10.25|25]] And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.

25: 

[[Josh.10.26|26]] And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.

26: 

[[Josh.10.27|27]] And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, \[that\] Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave’s mouth, \[which remain\] until this very day.

27: 

[[Josh.10.28|28]] And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that \[were\] therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.

28:
