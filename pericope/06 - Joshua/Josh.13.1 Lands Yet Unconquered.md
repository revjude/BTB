[[Josh.13|Joshua 13:1 - Joshua 13:7]]
*Lands Yet Unconquered*

[[Josh.13.1|1]] Now Joshua was old \[and\] stricken in years; and the LORD said unto him, Thou art old \[and\] stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.

1: 

[[Josh.13.2|2]] This \[is\] the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,

2: 

[[Josh.13.3|3]] From Sihor, which \[is\] before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron northward, \[which\] is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:

3: 

[[Josh.13.4|4]] From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that \[is\] beside the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:

4: 

[[Josh.13.5|5]] And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath.

5: 

[[Josh.13.6|6]] All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephothmaim, \[and\] all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.

6: 

[[Josh.13.7|7]] Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,

7:
