[[Josh.11|Joshua 11:1 - Joshua 11:15]]
*Conquest of the Northern Cities*

[[Josh.11.1|1]] And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard \[those things\], that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,

1: 

[[Josh.11.2|2]] And to the kings that \[were\] on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,

2: 

[[Josh.11.3|3]] \[And to\] the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and \[to\] the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and \[to\] the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.

3: 

[[Josh.11.4|4]] And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that \[is\] upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.

4: 

[[Josh.11.5|5]] And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.

5: 

[[Josh.11.6|6]] And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.

6: 

[[Josh.11.7|7]] So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.

7: 

[[Josh.11.8|8]] And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.

8: 

[[Josh.11.9|9]] And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.

9: 

[[Josh.11.10|10]] And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.

10: 

[[Josh.11.11|11]] And they smote all the souls that \[were\] therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying \[them\]: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.

11: 

[[Josh.11.12|12]] And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, \[and\] he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.

12: 

[[Josh.11.13|13]] But \[as for\] the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; \[that\] did Joshua burn.

13: 

[[Josh.11.14|14]] And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.

14: 

[[Josh.11.15|15]] As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.

15:
