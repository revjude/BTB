[[Josh.22|Joshua 22:1 - Joshua 22:8]]
*The Eastern Tribes Return Home*

[[Josh.22.1|1]] Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh,

1: 

[[Josh.22.2|2]] And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you:

2: 

[[Josh.22.3|3]] Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God.

3: 

[[Josh.22.4|4]] And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your tents, \[and\] unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.

4: 

[[Josh.22.5|5]] But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.

5: 

[[Josh.22.6|6]] So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents.

6: 

[[Josh.22.7|7]] Now to the \[one\] half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given \[possession\] in Bashan: but unto the \[other\] half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them,

7: 

[[Josh.22.8|8]] And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.

8:
