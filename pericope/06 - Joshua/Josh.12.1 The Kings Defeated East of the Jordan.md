[[Josh.12.2|2]] Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, \[and\] ruled from Aroer, which \[is\] upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, \[which is\] the border of the children of Ammon;

2: 

[[Josh.12.3|3]] And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto the sea of the plain, \[even\] the salt sea on the east, the way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah:
