[[Josh.1|Joshua 1:1 - Joshua 1:9]]
*God Instructs Joshua*

[[Josh.1.1|1]] Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ minister, saying,

1: 

[[Josh.1.2|2]] Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, \[even\] to the children of Israel.

2: 

[[Josh.1.3|3]] Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.

3: 

[[Josh.1.4|4]] From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.

4: 

[[Josh.1.5|5]] There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, \[so\] I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

5: 

[[Josh.1.6|6]] Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.

6: 

[[Josh.1.7|7]] Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it \[to\] the right hand or \[to\] the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.

7: 

[[Josh.1.8|8]] This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.

8: 

[[Josh.1.9|9]] Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God \[is\] with thee whithersoever thou goest.

9:
