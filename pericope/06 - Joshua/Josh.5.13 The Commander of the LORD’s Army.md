[[Josh.5|Joshua 5:13 - Joshua 5:15]]
*The Commander of the LORD’s Army*

[[Josh.5.13|13]] And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, \[Art\] thou for us, or for our adversaries?

13: 

[[Josh.5.14|14]] And he said, Nay; but \[as\] captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?

14: 

[[Josh.5.15|15]] And the captain of the LORD’S host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest \[is\] holy. And Joshua did so.

15:
