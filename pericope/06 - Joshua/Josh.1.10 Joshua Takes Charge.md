[[Josh.1|Joshua 1:10 - Joshua 1:18]]
*Joshua Takes Charge*

[[Josh.1.10|10]] Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,

10: 

[[Josh.1.11|11]] Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.

11: 

[[Josh.1.12|12]] And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,

12: 

[[Josh.1.13|13]] Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.

13: 

[[Josh.1.14|14]] Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;

14: 

[[Josh.1.15|15]] Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as \[he hath given\] you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD’S servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.

15: 

[[Josh.1.16|16]] And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.

16: 

[[Josh.1.17|17]] According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.

17: 

[[Josh.1.18|18]] Whosoever \[he be\] that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.

18:
