[[Josh.18|Joshua 18:1 - Joshua 18:10]]
*The Remainder Divided*

[[Josh.18.1|1]] And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.

1: 

[[Josh.18.2|2]] And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance.

2: 

[[Josh.18.3|3]] And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long \[are\] ye slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you?

3: 

[[Josh.18.4|4]] Give out from among you three men for \[each\] tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come \[again\] to me.

4: 

[[Josh.18.5|5]] And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north.

5: 

[[Josh.18.6|6]] Ye shall therefore describe the land \[into\] seven parts, and bring \[the description\] hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.

6: 

[[Josh.18.7|7]] But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD \[is\] their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.

7: 

[[Josh.18.8|8]] And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.

8: 

[[Josh.18.9|9]] And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came \[again\] to Joshua to the host at Shiloh.

9: 

[[Josh.18.10|10]] And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions.

10:
