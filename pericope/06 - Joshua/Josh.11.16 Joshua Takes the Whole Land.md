[[Josh.11|Joshua 11:16 - Joshua 11:23]]
*Joshua Takes the Whole Land*

[[Josh.11.16|16]] So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;

16: 

[[Josh.11.17|17]] \[Even\] from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.

17: 

[[Josh.11.18|18]] Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.

18: 

[[Josh.11.19|19]] There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all \[other\] they took in battle.

19: 

[[Josh.11.20|20]] For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, \[and\] that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.

20: 

[[Josh.11.21|21]] And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.

21: 

[[Josh.11.22|22]] There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.

22: 

[[Josh.11.23|23]] So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.

23:
