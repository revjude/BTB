[[Josh.2|Joshua 2:1 - Joshua 2:7]]
*Rahab Welcomes the Spies*

[[Josh.2.1|1]] And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot’s house, named Rahab, and lodged there.

1: 

[[Josh.2.2|2]] And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.

2: 

[[Josh.2.3|3]] And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country.

3: 

[[Josh.2.4|4]] And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they \[were\]:

4: 

[[Josh.2.5|5]] And it came to pass \[about the time\] of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.

5: 

[[Josh.2.6|6]] But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.

6: 

[[Josh.2.7|7]] And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.

7:
