[[Josh.18|Joshua 18:11 - Joshua 18:28]]
*Benjamin’s Inheritance*

[[Josh.18.11|11]] And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.

11: 

[[Josh.18.12|12]] And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Bethaven.

12: 

[[Josh.18.13|13]] And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which \[is\] Bethel, southward; and the border descended to Atarothadar, near the hill that \[lieth\] on the south side of the nether Bethhoron.

13: 

[[Josh.18.14|14]] And the border was drawn \[thence\], and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that \[lieth\] before Bethhoron southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal, which \[is\] Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this \[was\] the west quarter.

14: 

[[Josh.18.15|15]] And the south quarter \[was\] from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah:

15: 

[[Josh.18.16|16]] And the border came down to the end of the mountain that \[lieth\] before the valley of the son of Hinnom, \[and\] which \[is\] in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,

16: 

[[Josh.18.17|17]] And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which \[is\] over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,

17: 

[[Josh.18.18|18]] And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah:

18: 

[[Josh.18.19|19]] And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this \[was\] the south coast.

19: 

[[Josh.18.20|20]] And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This \[was\] the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round about, according to their families.

20: 

[[Josh.18.21|21]] Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and the valley of Keziz,

21: 

[[Josh.18.22|22]] And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,

22: 

[[Josh.18.23|23]] And Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah,

23: 

[[Josh.18.24|24]] And Chepharhaammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages:

24: 

[[Josh.18.25|25]] Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,

25: 

[[Josh.18.26|26]] And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,

26: 

[[Josh.18.27|27]] And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,

27: 

[[Josh.18.28|28]] And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which \[is\] Jerusalem, Gibeath, \[and\] Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This \[is\] the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families.
