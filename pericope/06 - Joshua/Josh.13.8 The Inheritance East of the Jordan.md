[[Josh.13|Joshua 13:8 - Joshua 13:14]]
*The Inheritance East of the Jordan*

[[Josh.13.8|8]] With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, \[even\] as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;

8: 

[[Josh.13.9|9]] From Aroer, that \[is\] upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that \[is\] in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon;

9: 

[[Josh.13.10|10]] And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;

10: 

[[Josh.13.11|11]] And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah;

11: 

[[Josh.13.12|12]] All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses smite, and cast them out.

12: 

[[Josh.13.13|13]] Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.

13: 

[[Josh.13.14|14]] Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire \[are\] their inheritance, as he said unto them.

14:
