[[2John.1|2 John 1:7 - 2 John 1:11]]
*Beware of Deceivers*

[[2John.1.7|7]] For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.

7: 

[[2John.1.8|8]] Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.

8: 

[[2John.1.9|9]] Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.

9: 

[[2John.1.10|10]] If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into \[your\] house, neither bid him God speed:

10: 

[[2John.1.11|11]] For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.

11:
