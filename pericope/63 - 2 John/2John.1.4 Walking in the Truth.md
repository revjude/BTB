[[2John.1|2 John 1:4 - 2 John 1:6]]
*Walking in the Truth*

[[2John.1.5|5]] And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.

5: 

[[2John.1.6|6]] And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.

6:
