[[Rev.4|Revelation 4:1 - Revelation 4:4]]
*The Throne in Heaven*

[[Rev.4.1|1]] After this I looked, and, behold, a door \[was\] opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard \[was\] as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.

1: 

[[Rev.4.2|2]] And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and \[one\] sat on the throne.

2: 

[[Rev.4.3|3]] And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and \[there was\] a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.

3: 

[[Rev.4.4|4]] And round about the throne \[were\] four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.

4:
