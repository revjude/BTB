[[Rev.20|Revelation 20:11 - Revelation 20:15]]
*Judgment before the Great White Throne*

[[Rev.20.11|11]] And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.

11: 

[[Rev.20.12|12]] And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is \[the book\] of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.

12: 

[[Rev.20.13|13]] And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.

13: 

[[Rev.20.14|14]] And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.

14: 

[[Rev.20.15|15]] And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

15:
