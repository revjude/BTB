[[Rev.5|Revelation 5:1 - Revelation 5:10]]
*The Lamb Takes the Scroll*

[[Rev.5.1|1]] And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.

1: 

[[Rev.5.2|2]] And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?

2: 

[[Rev.5.3|3]] And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.

3: 

[[Rev.5.4|4]] And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.

4: 

[[Rev.5.5|5]] And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.

5: 

[[Rev.5.6|6]] And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.

6: 

[[Rev.5.7|7]] And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.

7: 

[[Rev.5.8|8]] And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four \[and\] twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.

8: 

[[Rev.5.9|9]] And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;

9: 

[[Rev.5.10|10]] And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.

10:
