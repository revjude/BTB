[[Rev.22|Revelation 22:18 - Revelation 22:21]]
*Nothing May Be Added or Removed*

[[Rev.22.18|18]] For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:

18: 

[[Rev.22.19|19]] And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and \[from\] the things which are written in this book.

19: 

[[Rev.22.20|20]] He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.

20: 

[[Rev.22.21|21]] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ \[be\] with you all. Amen.

21:
