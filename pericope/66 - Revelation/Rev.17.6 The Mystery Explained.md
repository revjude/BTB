[[Rev.17|Revelation 17:6 - Revelation 17:13]]
*The Mystery Explained*

[[Rev.17.6|6]] And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.

6: 

[[Rev.17.7|7]] And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.

7: 

[[Rev.17.8|8]] The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.

8: 

[[Rev.17.9|9]] And here \[is\] the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.

9: 

[[Rev.17.10|10]] And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, \[and\] the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.

10: 

[[Rev.17.11|11]] And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.

11: 

[[Rev.17.12|12]] And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.

12: 

[[Rev.17.13|13]] These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.

13:
