[[Rev.18|Revelation 18:21 - Revelation 18:24]]
*The Doom of Babylon*

[[Rev.18.21|21]] And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast \[it\] into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.

21: 

[[Rev.18.22|22]] And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft \[he be\], shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;

22: 

[[Rev.18.23|23]] And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.

23: 

[[Rev.18.24|24]] And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.

24:
