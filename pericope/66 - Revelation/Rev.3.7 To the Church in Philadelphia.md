[[Rev.3|Revelation 3:7 - Revelation 3:13]]
*To the Church in Philadelphia*

[[Rev.3.7|7]] And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;

7: 

[[Rev.3.8|8]] I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.

8: 

[[Rev.3.9|9]] Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.

9: 

[[Rev.3.10|10]] Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.

10: 

[[Rev.3.11|11]] Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.

11: 

[[Rev.3.12|12]] Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, \[which is\] new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and \[I will write upon him\] my new name.

12: 

[[Rev.3.13|13]] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

13:
