[[Rev.17|Revelation 17:1 - Revelation 17:5]]
*The Woman on the Beast*

[[Rev.17.1|1]] And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:

1: 

[[Rev.17.2|2]] With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.

2: 

[[Rev.17.3|3]] So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.

3: 

[[Rev.17.4|4]] And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:

4: 

[[Rev.17.5|5]] And upon her forehead \[was\] a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.

5:
