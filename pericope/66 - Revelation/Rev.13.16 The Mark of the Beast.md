[[Rev.13|Revelation 13:16 - Revelation 13:18]]
*The Mark of the Beast*

[[Rev.13.16|16]] And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:

16: 

[[Rev.13.17|17]] And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

17: 

[[Rev.13.18|18]] Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number \[is\] Six hundred threescore \[and\] six.

18:
