[[Rev.20|Revelation 20:7 - Revelation 20:10]]
*Satan Cast into the Lake of Fire*

[[Rev.20.7|7]] And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,

7: 

[[Rev.20.8|8]] And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom \[is\] as the sand of the sea.

8: 

[[Rev.20.9|9]] And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.

9: 

[[Rev.20.10|10]] And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet \[are\], and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

10:
