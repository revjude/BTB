[[Rev.13|Revelation 13:1 - Revelation 13:10]]
*The Beast from the Sea*

[[Rev.13.1|1]] And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.

1: 

[[Rev.13.2|2]] And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as \[the feet\] of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.

2: 

[[Rev.13.3|3]] And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.

3: 

[[Rev.13.4|4]] And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who \[is\] like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?

4: 

[[Rev.13.5|5]] And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty \[and\] two months.

5: 

[[Rev.13.6|6]] And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.

6: 

[[Rev.13.7|7]] And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.

7: 

[[Rev.13.8|8]] And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

8: 

[[Rev.13.9|9]] If any man have an ear, let him hear.

9: 

[[Rev.13.10|10]] He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.

10:
