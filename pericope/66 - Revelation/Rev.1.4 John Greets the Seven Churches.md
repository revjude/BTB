*John Greets the Seven Churches*

[[Rev.1.4|4]] John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace \[be\] unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;

4: 

[[Rev.1.5|5]] And from Jesus Christ, \[who is\] the faithful witness, \[and\] the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,

5: 

[[Rev.1.6|6]] And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him \[be\] glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

6: 

[[Rev.1.7|7]] Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they \[also\] which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.

7: 

[[Rev.1.8|8]] I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.
