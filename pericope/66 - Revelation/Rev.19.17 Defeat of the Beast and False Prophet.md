[[Rev.19|Revelation 19:17 - Revelation 19:21]]
*Defeat of the Beast and False Prophet*

[[Rev.19.17|17]] And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;

17: 

[[Rev.19.18|18]] That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all \[men, both\] free and bond, both small and great.

18: 

[[Rev.19.19|19]] And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.

19: 

[[Rev.19.20|20]] And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.

20: 

[[Rev.19.21|21]] And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which \[sword\] proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.

21:
