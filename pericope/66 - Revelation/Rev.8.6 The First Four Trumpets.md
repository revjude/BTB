[[Rev.8|Revelation 8:6 - Revelation 8:13]]
*The First Four Trumpets*

[[Rev.8.6|6]] And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.

6: 

[[Rev.8.7|7]] The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.

7: 

[[Rev.8.8|8]] And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;

8: 

[[Rev.8.9|9]] And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.

9: 

[[Rev.8.10|10]] And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;

10: 

[[Rev.8.11|11]] And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.

11: 

[[Rev.8.12|12]] And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.

12: 

[[Rev.8.13|13]] And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!

13:
