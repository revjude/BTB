[[Rev.19|Revelation 19:11 - Revelation 19:16]]
*The Rider on the White Horse*

[[Rev.19.11|11]] And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him \[was\] called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.

11: 

[[Rev.19.12|12]] His eyes \[were\] as a flame of fire, and on his head \[were\] many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.

12: 

[[Rev.19.13|13]] And he \[was\] clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.

13: 

[[Rev.19.14|14]] And the armies \[which were\] in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

14: 

[[Rev.19.15|15]] And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.

15: 

[[Rev.19.16|16]] And he hath on \[his\] vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.

16:
