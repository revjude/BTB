[[Rev.9|Revelation 9:1 - Revelation 9:12]]
*The Fifth Trumpet*

[[Rev.9.1|1]] And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.

1: 

[[Rev.9.2|2]] And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.

2: 

[[Rev.9.3|3]] And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.

3: 

[[Rev.9.4|4]] And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.

4: 

[[Rev.9.5|5]] And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment \[was\] as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.

5: 

[[Rev.9.6|6]] And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.

6: 

[[Rev.9.7|7]] And the shapes of the locusts \[were\] like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads \[were\] as it were crowns like gold, and their faces \[were\] as the faces of men.

7: 

[[Rev.9.8|8]] And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as \[the teeth\] of lions.

8: 

[[Rev.9.9|9]] And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings \[was\] as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.

9: 

[[Rev.9.10|10]] And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power \[was\] to hurt men five months.

10: 

[[Rev.9.11|11]] And they had a king over them, \[which is\] the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue \[is\] Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath \[his\] name Apollyon.

11: 

[[Rev.9.12|12]] One woe is past; \[and\], behold, there come two woes more hereafter.

12:
