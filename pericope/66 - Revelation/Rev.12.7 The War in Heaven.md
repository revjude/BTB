[[Rev.12|Revelation 12:7 - Revelation 12:12]]
*The War in Heaven*

[[Rev.12.7|7]] And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,

7: 

[[Rev.12.8|8]] And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.

8: 

[[Rev.12.9|9]] And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.

9: 

[[Rev.12.10|10]] And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.

10: 

[[Rev.12.11|11]] And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.

11: 

[[Rev.12.12|12]] Therefore rejoice, \[ye\] heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.

12:
