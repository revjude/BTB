[[Rev.8.1|1]] And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.

1: 

[[Rev.8.2|2]] And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.

2: 

[[Rev.8.3|3]] And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer \[it\] with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.

3: 

[[Rev.8.4|4]] And the smoke of the incense, \[which came\] with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel’s hand.

4: 

[[Rev.8.5|5]] And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast \[it\] into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.
