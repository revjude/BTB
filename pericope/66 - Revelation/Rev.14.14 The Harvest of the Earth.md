[[Rev.14|Revelation 14:14 - Revelation 14:20]]
*The Harvest of the Earth*

[[Rev.14.14|14]] And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud \[one\] sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.

14: 

[[Rev.14.15|15]] And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.

15: 

[[Rev.14.16|16]] And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.

16: 

[[Rev.14.17|17]] And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.

17: 

[[Rev.14.18|18]] And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.

18: 

[[Rev.14.19|19]] And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast \[it\] into the great winepress of the wrath of God.

19: 

[[Rev.14.20|20]] And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand \[and\] six hundred furlongs.

20:
