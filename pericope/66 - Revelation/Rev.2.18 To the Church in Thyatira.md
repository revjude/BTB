[[Rev.2|Revelation 2:18 - Revelation 2:29]]
*To the Church in Thyatira*

[[Rev.2.18|18]] And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet \[are\] like fine brass;

18: 

[[Rev.2.19|19]] I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last \[to be\] more than the first.

19: 

[[Rev.2.20|20]] Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.

20: 

[[Rev.2.21|21]] And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.

21: 

[[Rev.2.22|22]] Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.

22: 

[[Rev.2.23|23]] And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.

23: 

[[Rev.2.24|24]] But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.

24: 

[[Rev.2.25|25]] But that which ye have \[already\] hold fast till I come.

25: 

[[Rev.2.26|26]] And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:

26: 

[[Rev.2.27|27]] And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.

27: 

[[Rev.2.28|28]] And I will give him the morning star.

28: 

[[Rev.2.29|29]] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

29:
