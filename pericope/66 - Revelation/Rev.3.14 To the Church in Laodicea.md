[[Rev.3|Revelation 3:14 - Revelation 3:22]]
*To the Church in Laodicea*

[[Rev.3.14|14]] And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;

14: 

[[Rev.3.15|15]] I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.

15: 

[[Rev.3.16|16]] So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.

16: 

[[Rev.3.17|17]] Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:

17: 

[[Rev.3.18|18]] I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and \[that\] the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.

18: 

[[Rev.3.19|19]] As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.

19: 

[[Rev.3.20|20]] Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.

20: 

[[Rev.3.21|21]] To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.

21: 

[[Rev.3.22|22]] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

22:
