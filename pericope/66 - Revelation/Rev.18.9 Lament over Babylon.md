[[Rev.18|Revelation 18:9 - Revelation 18:20]]
*Lament over Babylon*

[[Rev.18.9|9]] And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,

9: 

[[Rev.18.10|10]] Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.

10: 

[[Rev.18.11|11]] And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:

11: 

[[Rev.18.12|12]] The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,

12: 

[[Rev.18.13|13]] And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.

13: 

[[Rev.18.14|14]] And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.

14: 

[[Rev.18.15|15]] The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,

15: 

[[Rev.18.16|16]] And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!

16: 

[[Rev.18.17|17]] For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,

17: 

[[Rev.18.18|18]] And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What \[city is\] like unto this great city!

18: 

[[Rev.18.19|19]] And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.

19: 

[[Rev.18.20|20]] Rejoice over her, \[thou\] heaven, and \[ye\] holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.

20:
