[[Rev.19|Revelation 19:6 - Revelation 19:10]]
*The Marriage of the Lamb*

[[Rev.19.6|6]] And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

6: 

[[Rev.19.7|7]] Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.

7: 

[[Rev.19.8|8]] And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.

8: 

[[Rev.19.9|9]] And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed \[are\] they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.

9: 

[[Rev.19.10|10]] And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See \[thou do it\] not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

10:
