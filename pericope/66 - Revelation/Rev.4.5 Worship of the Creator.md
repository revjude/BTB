[[Rev.4|Revelation 4:5 - Revelation 4:11]]
*Worship of the Creator*

[[Rev.4.5|5]] And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and \[there were\] seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.

5: 

[[Rev.4.6|6]] And before the throne \[there was\] a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, \[were\] four beasts full of eyes before and behind.

6: 

[[Rev.4.7|7]] And the first beast \[was\] like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast \[was\] like a flying eagle.

7: 

[[Rev.4.8|8]] And the four beasts had each of them six wings about \[him\]; and \[they were\] full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.

8: 

[[Rev.4.9|9]] And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,

9: 

[[Rev.4.10|10]] The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,

10: 

[[Rev.4.11|11]] Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.

11:
