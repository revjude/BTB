[[Rev.6|Revelation 6:12 - Revelation 6:17]]
*The Sixth Seal：Terror*

[[Rev.6.12|12]] And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;

12: 

[[Rev.6.13|13]] And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.

13: 

[[Rev.6.14|14]] And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.

14: 

[[Rev.6.15|15]] And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;

15: 

[[Rev.6.16|16]] And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:

16: 

[[Rev.6.17|17]] For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?

17:
