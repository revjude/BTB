[[Rev.2|Revelation 2:1 - Revelation 2:7]]
*To the Church in Ephesus*

[[Rev.2.1|1]] Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;

1: 

[[Rev.2.2|2]] I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:

2: 

[[Rev.2.3|3]] And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name’s sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.

3: 

[[Rev.2.4|4]] Nevertheless I have \[somewhat\] against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.

4: 

[[Rev.2.5|5]] Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.

5: 

[[Rev.2.6|6]] But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.

6: 

[[Rev.2.7|7]] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.

7:
