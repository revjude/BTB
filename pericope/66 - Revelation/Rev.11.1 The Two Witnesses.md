[[Rev.11|Revelation 11:1 - Revelation 11:6]]
*The Two Witnesses*

[[Rev.11.1|1]] And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.

1: 

[[Rev.11.2|2]] But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty \[and\] two months.

2: 

[[Rev.11.3|3]] And I will give \[power\] unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred \[and\] threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.

3: 

[[Rev.11.4|4]] These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.

4: 

[[Rev.11.5|5]] And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.

5: 

[[Rev.11.6|6]] These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.

6:
