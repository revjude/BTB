[[Rev.11|Revelation 11:7 - Revelation 11:14]]
*The Witnesses Killed and Raised*

[[Rev.11.7|7]] And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.

7: 

[[Rev.11.8|8]] And their dead bodies \[shall lie\] in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.

8: 

[[Rev.11.9|9]] And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.

9: 

[[Rev.11.10|10]] And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.

10: 

[[Rev.11.11|11]] And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.

11: 

[[Rev.11.12|12]] And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.

12: 

[[Rev.11.13|13]] And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.

13: 

[[Rev.11.14|14]] The second woe is past; \[and\], behold, the third woe cometh quickly.

14:
