[[Rev.22|Revelation 22:1 - Revelation 22:5]]
*The River of Life*

[[Rev.22.1|1]] And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.

1: 

[[Rev.22.2|2]] In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, \[was there\] the tree of life, which bare twelve \[manner of\] fruits, \[and\] yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree \[were\] for the healing of the nations.

2: 

[[Rev.22.3|3]] And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:

3: 

[[Rev.22.4|4]] And they shall see his face; and his name \[shall be\] in their foreheads.

4: 

[[Rev.22.5|5]] And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.

5:
