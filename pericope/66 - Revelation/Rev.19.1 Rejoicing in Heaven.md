[[Rev.19|Revelation 19:1 - Revelation 19:5]]
*Rejoicing in Heaven*

[[Rev.19.1|1]] And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:

1: 

[[Rev.19.2|2]] For true and righteous \[are\] his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.

2: 

[[Rev.19.3|3]] And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.

3: 

[[Rev.19.4|4]] And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.

4: 

[[Rev.19.5|5]] And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.

5:
