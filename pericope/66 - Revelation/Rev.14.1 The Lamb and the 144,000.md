[[Rev.14|Revelation 14:1 - Revelation 14:5]]
*The Lamb and the 144,000*

[[Rev.14.1|1]] And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty \[and\] four thousand, having his Father’s name written in their foreheads.

1: 

[[Rev.14.2|2]] And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:

2: 

[[Rev.14.3|3]] And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred \[and\] forty \[and\] four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.

3: 

[[Rev.14.4|4]] These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, \[being\] the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.

4: 

[[Rev.14.5|5]] And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.

5:
