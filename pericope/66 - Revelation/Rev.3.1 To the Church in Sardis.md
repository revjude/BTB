[[Rev.3|Revelation 3:1 - Revelation 3:6]]
*To the Church in Sardis*

[[Rev.3.1|1]] And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.

1: 

[[Rev.3.2|2]] Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.

2: 

[[Rev.3.3|3]] Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.

3: 

[[Rev.3.4|4]] Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.

4: 

[[Rev.3.5|5]] He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.

5: 

[[Rev.3.6|6]] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

6:
