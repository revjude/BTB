[[Rev.17|Revelation 17:14 - Revelation 17:18]]
*The Victory of the Lamb*

[[Rev.17.14|14]] These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him \[are\] called, and chosen, and faithful.

14: 

[[Rev.17.15|15]] And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.

15: 

[[Rev.17.16|16]] And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.

16: 

[[Rev.17.17|17]] For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.

17: 

[[Rev.17.18|18]] And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.

18:
