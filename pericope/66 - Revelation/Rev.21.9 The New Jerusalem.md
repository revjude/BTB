[[Rev.21|Revelation 21:9 - Revelation 21:27]]
*The New Jerusalem*

[[Rev.21.9|9]] And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife.

9: 

[[Rev.21.10|10]] And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,

10: 

[[Rev.21.11|11]] Having the glory of God: and her light \[was\] like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;

11: 

[[Rev.21.12|12]] And had a wall great and high, \[and\] had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are \[the names\] of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:

12: 

[[Rev.21.13|13]] On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.

13: 

[[Rev.21.14|14]] And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

14: 

[[Rev.21.15|15]] And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.

15: 

[[Rev.21.16|16]] And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.

16: 

[[Rev.21.17|17]] And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred \[and\] forty \[and\] four cubits, \[according to\] the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.

17: 

[[Rev.21.18|18]] And the building of the wall of it was \[of\] jasper: and the city \[was\] pure gold, like unto clear glass.

18: 

[[Rev.21.19|19]] And the foundations of the wall of the city \[were\] garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation \[was\] jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;

19: 

[[Rev.21.20|20]] The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.

20: 

[[Rev.21.21|21]] And the twelve gates \[were\] twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city \[was\] pure gold, as it were transparent glass.

21: 

[[Rev.21.22|22]] And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.

22: 

[[Rev.21.23|23]] And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb \[is\] the light thereof.

23: 

[[Rev.21.24|24]] And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.

24: 

[[Rev.21.25|25]] And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.

25: 

[[Rev.21.26|26]] And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.

26: 

[[Rev.21.27|27]] And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither \[whatsoever\] worketh abomination, or \[maketh\] a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.

27:
