[[Rev.20|Revelation 20:1 - Revelation 20:6]]
*Satan Bound*

[[Rev.20.1|1]] And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.

1: 

[[Rev.20.2|2]] And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,

2: 

[[Rev.20.3|3]] And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.

3: 

[[Rev.20.4|4]] And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and \[I saw\] the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received \[his\] mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.

4: 

[[Rev.20.5|5]] But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This \[is\] the first resurrection.

5: 

[[Rev.20.6|6]] Blessed and holy \[is\] he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.

6:
