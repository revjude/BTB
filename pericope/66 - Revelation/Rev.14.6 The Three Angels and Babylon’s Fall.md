[[Rev.14|Revelation 14:6 - Revelation 14:13]]
*The Three Angels and Babylon’s Fall*

[[Rev.14.6|6]] And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,

6: 

[[Rev.14.7|7]] Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.

7: 

[[Rev.14.8|8]] And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.

8: 

[[Rev.14.9|9]] And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive \[his\] mark in his forehead, or in his hand,

9: 

[[Rev.14.10|10]] The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:

10: 

[[Rev.14.11|11]] And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

11: 

[[Rev.14.12|12]] Here is the patience of the saints: here \[are\] they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

12: 

[[Rev.14.13|13]] And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed \[are\] the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.

13:
