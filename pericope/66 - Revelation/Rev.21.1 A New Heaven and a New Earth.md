[[Rev.21|Revelation 21:1 - Revelation 21:8]]
*A New Heaven and a New Earth*

[[Rev.21.1|1]] And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.

1: 

[[Rev.21.2|2]] And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.

2: 

[[Rev.21.3|3]] And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God \[is\] with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, \[and be\] their God.

3: 

[[Rev.21.4|4]] And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.

4: 

[[Rev.21.5|5]] And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.

5: 

[[Rev.21.6|6]] And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.

6: 

[[Rev.21.7|7]] He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.

7: 

[[Rev.21.8|8]] But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.

8:
