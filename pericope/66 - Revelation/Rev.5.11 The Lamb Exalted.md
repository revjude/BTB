[[Rev.5|Revelation 5:11 - Revelation 5:14]]
*The Lamb Exalted*

[[Rev.5.11|11]] And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;

11: 

[[Rev.5.12|12]] Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.

12: 

[[Rev.5.13|13]] And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, \[be\] unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.

13: 

[[Rev.5.14|14]] And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four \[and\] twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.

14:
