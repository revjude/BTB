*The Woman and the Dragon*

[[Rev.12.1|1]] And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:

1: 

[[Rev.12.2|2]] And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.

2: 

[[Rev.12.3|3]] And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.

3: 

[[Rev.12.4|4]] And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.

4: 

[[Rev.12.5|5]] And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and \[to\] his throne.

5: 

[[Rev.12.6|6]] And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred \[and\] threescore days.

6:
