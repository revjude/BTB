[[Rev.18|Revelation 18:1 - Revelation 18:8]]
*Babylon Is Fallen*

[[Rev.18.1|1]] And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.

1: 

[[Rev.18.2|2]] And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.

2: 

[[Rev.18.3|3]] For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.

3: 

[[Rev.18.4|4]] And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.

4: 

[[Rev.18.5|5]] For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.

5: 

[[Rev.18.6|6]] Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.

6: 

[[Rev.18.7|7]] How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.

7: 

[[Rev.18.8|8]] Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong \[is\] the Lord God who judgeth her.

8:
