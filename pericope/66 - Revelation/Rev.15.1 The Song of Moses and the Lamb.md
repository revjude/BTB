[[Rev.15|Revelation 15:1 - Revelation 15:4]]
*The Song of Moses and the Lamb*

[[Rev.15.1|1]] And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.

1: 

[[Rev.15.2|2]] And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, \[and\] over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.

2: 

[[Rev.15.3|3]] And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous \[are\] thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true \[are\] thy ways, thou King of saints.

3: 

[[Rev.15.4|4]] Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for \[thou\] only \[art\] holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.

4:
