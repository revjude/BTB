[[Rev.2|Revelation 2:8 - Revelation 2:11]]
*To the Church in Smyrna*

[[Rev.2.8|8]] And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;

8: 

[[Rev.2.9|9]] I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and \[I know\] the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but \[are\] the synagogue of Satan.

9: 

[[Rev.2.10|10]] Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast \[some\] of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.

10: 

[[Rev.2.11|11]] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.

11:
