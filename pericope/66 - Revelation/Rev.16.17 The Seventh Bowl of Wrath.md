[[Rev.16|Revelation 16:17 - Revelation 16:21]]
*The Seventh Bowl of Wrath*

[[Rev.16.17|17]] And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.

17: 

[[Rev.16.18|18]] And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, \[and\] so great.

18: 

[[Rev.16.19|19]] And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.

19: 

[[Rev.16.20|20]] And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.

20: 

[[Rev.16.21|21]] And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, \[every stone\] about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.

21:
