[[Rev.2|Revelation 2:12 - Revelation 2:17]]
*To the Church in Pergamum*

[[Rev.2.12|12]] And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;

12: 

[[Rev.2.13|13]] I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, \[even\] where Satan’s seat \[is\]: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas \[was\] my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.

13: 

[[Rev.2.14|14]] But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.

14: 

[[Rev.2.15|15]] So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.

15: 

[[Rev.2.16|16]] Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.

16: 

[[Rev.2.17|17]] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth \[it\].

17:
