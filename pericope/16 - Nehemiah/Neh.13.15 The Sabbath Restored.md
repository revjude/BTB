[[Neh.13|Nehemiah 13:15 - Nehemiah 13:22]]
*The Sabbath Restored*

[[Neh.13.15|15]] In those days saw I in Judah \[some\] treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all \[manner of\] burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified \[against them\] in the day wherein they sold victuals.

15: 

[[Neh.13.16|16]] There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.

16: 

[[Neh.13.17|17]] Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing \[is\] this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?

17: 

[[Neh.13.18|18]] Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.

18: 

[[Neh.13.19|19]] And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and \[some\] of my servants set I at the gates, \[that\] there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.

19: 

[[Neh.13.20|20]] So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.

20: 

[[Neh.13.21|21]] Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do \[so\] again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no \[more\] on the sabbath.

21: 

[[Neh.13.22|22]] And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and \[that\] they should come \[and\] keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, \[concerning\] this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.

22:
