[[Neh.2|Nehemiah 2:11 - Nehemiah 2:20]]
*Nehemiah Inspects the Walls*

[[Neh.2.11|11]] So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.

11: 

[[Neh.2.12|12]] And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I \[any\] man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither \[was there any\] beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.

12: 

[[Neh.2.13|13]] And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.

13: 

[[Neh.2.14|14]] Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king’s pool: but \[there was\] no place for the beast \[that was\] under me to pass.

14: 

[[Neh.2.15|15]] Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and \[so\] returned.

15: 

[[Neh.2.16|16]] And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told \[it\] to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.

16: 

[[Neh.2.17|17]] Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we \[are\] in, how Jerusalem \[lieth\] waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.

17: 

[[Neh.2.18|18]] Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king’s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for \[this\] good \[work\].

18: 

[[Neh.2.19|19]] But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard \[it\], they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What \[is\] this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?

19: 

[[Neh.2.20|20]] Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.

20:
