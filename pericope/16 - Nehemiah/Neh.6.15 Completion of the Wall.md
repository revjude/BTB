[[Neh.6|Nehemiah 6:15 - Nehemiah 6:19]]
*Completion of the Wall*

[[Neh.6.15|15]] So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth \[day\] of \[the month\] Elul, in fifty and two days.

15: 

[[Neh.6.16|16]] And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard \[thereof\], and all the heathen that \[were\] about us saw \[these things\], they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.

16: 

[[Neh.6.17|17]] Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and \[the letters\] of Tobiah came unto them.

17:

18: 

[[Neh.6.19|19]] Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. \[And\] Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.
