[[Neh.4|Nehemiah 4:1 - Nehemiah 4:8]]
*The Work Ridiculed*

[[Neh.4.1|1]] But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.

1: 

[[Neh.4.2|2]] And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?

2: 

[[Neh.4.3|3]] Now Tobiah the Ammonite \[was\] by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.

3: 

[[Neh.4.4|4]] Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:

4: 

[[Neh.4.5|5]] And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked \[thee\] to anger before the builders.

5: 

[[Neh.4.6|6]] So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.

6: 

[[Neh.4.7|7]] But it came to pass, \[that\] when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, \[and\] that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,

7: 

[[Neh.4.8|8]] And conspired all of them together to come \[and\] to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.

8:
