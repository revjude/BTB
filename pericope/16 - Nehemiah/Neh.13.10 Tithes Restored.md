[[Neh.13|Nehemiah 13:10 - Nehemiah 13:14]]
*Tithes Restored*

[[Neh.13.10|10]] And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given \[them\]: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.

10: 

[[Neh.13.11|11]] Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.

11: 

[[Neh.13.12|12]] Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.

12: 

[[Neh.13.13|13]] And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them \[was\] Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office \[was\] to distribute unto their brethren.

13: 

[[Neh.13.14|14]] Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.

14:
