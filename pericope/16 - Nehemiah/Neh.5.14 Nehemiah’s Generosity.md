[[Neh.5|Nehemiah 5:14 - Nehemiah 5:19]]
*Nehemiah’s Generosity*

[[Neh.5.14|14]] Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, \[that is\], twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.

14: 

[[Neh.5.15|15]] But the former governors that \[had been\] before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.

15: 

[[Neh.5.16|16]] Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants \[were\] gathered thither unto the work.

16: 

[[Neh.5.17|17]] Moreover \[there were\] at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that \[are\] about us.

17: 

[[Neh.5.18|18]] Now \[that\] which was prepared \[for me\] daily \[was\] one ox \[and\] six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.

18: 

[[Neh.5.19|19]] Think upon me, my God, for good, \[according\] to all that I have done for this people.

19:
