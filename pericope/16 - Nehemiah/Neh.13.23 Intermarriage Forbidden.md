[[Neh.13|Nehemiah 13:23 - Nehemiah 13:31]]
*Intermarriage Forbidden*

[[Neh.13.23|23]] In those days also saw I Jews \[that\] had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, \[and\] of Moab:

23: 

[[Neh.13.24|24]] And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews’ language, but according to the language of each people.

24: 

[[Neh.13.25|25]] And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, \[saying\], Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.

25: 

[[Neh.13.26|26]] Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.

26: 

[[Neh.13.27|27]] Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?

27: 

[[Neh.13.28|28]] And \[one\] of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, \[was\] son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.

28: 

[[Neh.13.29|29]] Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.

29: 

[[Neh.13.30|30]] Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;

30: 

[[Neh.13.31|31]] And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.

31:
