[[Neh.6|Nehemiah 6:1 - Nehemiah 6:14]]
*Sanballat’s Conspiracy*

[[Neh.6.1|1]] Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and \[that\] there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)

1: 

[[Neh.6.2|2]] That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in \[some one of\] the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.

2: 

[[Neh.6.3|3]] And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I \[am\] doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?

3: 

[[Neh.6.4|4]] Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.

4: 

[[Neh.6.5|5]] Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;

5: 

[[Neh.6.6|6]] Wherein \[was\] written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith \[it, that\] thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.

6: 

[[Neh.6.7|7]] And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, \[There is\] a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.

7: 

[[Neh.6.8|8]] Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.

8: 

[[Neh.6.9|9]] For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, \[O God\], strengthen my hands.

9: 

[[Neh.6.10|10]] Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who \[was\] shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.

10: 

[[Neh.6.11|11]] And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who \[is there\], that, \[being\] as I \[am\], would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.

11: 

[[Neh.6.12|12]] And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.

12: 

[[Neh.6.13|13]] Therefore \[was\] he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and \[that\] they might have \[matter\] for an evil report, that they might reproach me.

13: 

[[Neh.6.14|14]] My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.

14:
