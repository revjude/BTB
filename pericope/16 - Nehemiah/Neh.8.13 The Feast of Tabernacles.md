[[Neh.8|Nehemiah 8:13 - Nehemiah 8:18]]
*The Feast of Tabernacles*

[[Neh.8.13|13]] And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law.

13: 

[[Neh.8.14|14]] And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month:

14: 

[[Neh.8.15|15]] And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as \[it is\] written.

15: 

[[Neh.8.16|16]] So the people went forth, and brought \[them\], and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.

16: 

[[Neh.8.17|17]] And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.

17: 

[[Neh.8.18|18]] Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day \[was\] a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.

18:
