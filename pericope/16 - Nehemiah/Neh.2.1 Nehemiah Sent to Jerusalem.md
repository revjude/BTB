[[Neh.2|Nehemiah 2:1 - Nehemiah 2:10]]
*Nehemiah Sent to Jerusalem*

[[Neh.2.1|1]] And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, \[that\] wine \[was\] before him: and I took up the wine, and gave \[it\] unto the king. Now I had not been \[beforetime\] sad in his presence.

1: 

[[Neh.2.2|2]] Wherefore the king said unto me, Why \[is\] thy countenance sad, seeing thou \[art\] not sick? this \[is\] nothing \[else\] but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,

2: 

[[Neh.2.3|3]] And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ sepulchres, \[lieth\] waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?

3: 

[[Neh.2.4|4]] Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.

4: 

[[Neh.2.5|5]] And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers’ sepulchres, that I may build it.

5: 

[[Neh.2.6|6]] And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.

6: 

[[Neh.2.7|7]] Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;

7: 

[[Neh.2.8|8]] And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which \[appertained\] to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.

8: 

[[Neh.2.9|9]] Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.

9: 

[[Neh.2.10|10]] When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard \[of it\], it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.

10:
