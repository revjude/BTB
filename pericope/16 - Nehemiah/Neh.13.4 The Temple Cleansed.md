[[Neh.13|Nehemiah 13:4 - Nehemiah 13:9]]
*The Temple Cleansed*

[[Neh.13.4|4]] And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, \[was\] allied unto Tobiah:

4: 

[[Neh.13.5|5]] And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded \[to be given\] to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.

5: 

[[Neh.13.6|6]] But in all this \[time\] was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:

6: 

[[Neh.13.7|7]] And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.

7: 

[[Neh.13.8|8]] And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.

8: 

[[Neh.13.9|9]] Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense.

9:
