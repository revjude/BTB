[[Ruth.1|Ruth 1:6 - Ruth 1:18]]
*Ruth’s Loyalty to Naomi*

[[Ruth.1.6|6]] Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.

6: 

[[Ruth.1.7|7]] Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.

7: 

[[Ruth.1.8|8]] And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother’s house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.

8: 

[[Ruth.1.9|9]] The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each \[of you\] in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.

9: 

[[Ruth.1.10|10]] And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.

10: 

[[Ruth.1.11|11]] And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? \[are\] there yet \[any more\] sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?

11: 

[[Ruth.1.12|12]] Turn again, my daughters, go \[your way\]; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, \[if\] I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;

12: 

[[Ruth.1.13|13]] Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.

13: 

[[Ruth.1.14|14]] And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.

14: 

[[Ruth.1.15|15]] And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.

15: 

[[Ruth.1.16|16]] And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, \[or\] to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people \[shall be\] my people, and thy God my God:

16: 

[[Ruth.1.17|17]] Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, \[if ought\] but death part thee and me.

17: 

[[Ruth.1.18|18]] When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.

18:
