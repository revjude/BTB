[[Ruth.1|Ruth 1:19 - Ruth 1:22]]
*The Return to Bethlehem*

[[Ruth.1.19|19]] So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, \[Is\] this Naomi?

19: 

[[Ruth.1.20|20]] And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.

20: 

[[Ruth.1.21|21]] I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why \[then\] call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?

21: 

[[Ruth.1.22|22]] So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.

22:
