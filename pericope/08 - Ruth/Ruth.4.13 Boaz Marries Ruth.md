[[Ruth.4|Ruth 4:13 - Ruth 4:17]]
*Boaz Marries Ruth*

[[Ruth.4.13|13]] So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.

13: 

[[Ruth.4.14|14]] And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed \[be\] the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.

14: 

[[Ruth.4.15|15]] And he shall be unto thee a restorer of \[thy\] life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.

15: 

[[Ruth.4.16|16]] And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.

16: 

[[Ruth.4.17|17]] And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he \[is\] the father of Jesse, the father of David.

17:
