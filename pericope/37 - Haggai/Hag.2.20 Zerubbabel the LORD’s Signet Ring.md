[[Hag.2|Haggai 2:20 - Haggai 2:23]]
*Zerubbabel the LORD’s Signet Ring*

[[Hag.2.20|20]] And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth \[day\] of the month, saying,

20: 

[[Hag.2.21|21]] Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;

21: 

[[Hag.2.22|22]] And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.

22: 

[[Hag.2.23|23]] In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts.

23:
