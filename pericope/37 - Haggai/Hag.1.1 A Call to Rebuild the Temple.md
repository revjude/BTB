[[Hag.1|Haggai 1:1 - Haggai 1:11]]
*A Call to Rebuild the Temple*

[[Hag.1.1|1]] In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,

1: 

[[Hag.1.2|2]] Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the LORD’S house should be built.

2: 

[[Hag.1.3|3]] Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,

3: 

[[Hag.1.4|4]] \[Is it\] time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and this house \[lie\] waste?

4: 

[[Hag.1.5|5]] Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.

5: 

[[Hag.1.6|6]] Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages \[to put it\] into a bag with holes.

6: 

[[Hag.1.7|7]] Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.

7: 

[[Hag.1.8|8]] Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD.

8: 

[[Hag.1.9|9]] Ye looked for much, and, lo, \[it came\] to little; and when ye brought \[it\] home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of mine house that \[is\] waste, and ye run every man unto his own house.

9: 

[[Hag.1.10|10]] Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed \[from\] her fruit.

10: 

[[Hag.1.11|11]] And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon \[that\] which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.

11:
