[[Hag.2|Haggai 2:1 - Haggai 2:9]]
*The Coming Glory of God’s House*

[[Hag.2.1|1]] In the seventh \[month\], in the one and twentieth \[day\] of the month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai, saying,

1: 

[[Hag.2.2|2]] Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,

2: 

[[Hag.2.3|3]] Who \[is\] left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? \[is it\] not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?

3: 

[[Hag.2.4|4]] Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work: for I \[am\] with you, saith the LORD of hosts:

4: 

[[Hag.2.5|5]] \[According to\] the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.

5: 

[[Hag.2.6|6]] For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it \[is\] a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry \[land\];

6: 

[[Hag.2.7|7]] And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts.

7: 

[[Hag.2.8|8]] The silver \[is\] mine, and the gold \[is\] mine, saith the LORD of hosts.

8: 

[[Hag.2.9|9]] The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts.

9:
