[[2Pet.3|2 Peter 3:14 - 2 Peter 3:18]]
*Final Exhortations*

[[2Pet.3.14|14]] Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.

14: 

[[2Pet.3.15|15]] And account \[that\] the longsuffering of our Lord \[is\] salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;

15: 

[[2Pet.3.16|16]] As also in all \[his\] epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as \[they do\] also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.

16: 

[[2Pet.3.17|17]] Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know \[these things\] before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.

17: 

[[2Pet.3.18|18]] But grow in grace, and \[in\] the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him \[be\] glory both now and for ever. Amen.

18:
