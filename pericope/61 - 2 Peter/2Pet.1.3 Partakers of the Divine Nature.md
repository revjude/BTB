[[2Pet.1|2 Peter 1:3 - 2 Peter 1:15]]
*Partakers of the Divine Nature*

[[2Pet.1.3|3]] According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that \[pertain\] unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:

3: 

[[2Pet.1.4|4]] Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.

4: 

[[2Pet.1.5|5]] And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;

5: 

[[2Pet.1.6|6]] And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;

6: 

[[2Pet.1.7|7]] And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.

7: 

[[2Pet.1.8|8]] For if these things be in you, and abound, they make \[you that ye shall\] neither \[be\] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

8: 

[[2Pet.1.9|9]] But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.

9: 

[[2Pet.1.10|10]] Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:

10: 

[[2Pet.1.11|11]] For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

11: 

[[2Pet.1.12|12]] Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know \[them\], and be established in the present truth.

12: 

[[2Pet.1.13|13]] Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting \[you\] in remembrance;

13: 

[[2Pet.1.14|14]] Knowing that shortly I must put off \[this\] my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.

14: 

[[2Pet.1.15|15]] Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.

15:
