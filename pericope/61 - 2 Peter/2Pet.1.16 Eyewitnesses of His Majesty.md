[[2Pet.1|2 Peter 1:16 - 2 Peter 1:21]]
*Eyewitnesses of His Majesty*

[[2Pet.1.16|16]] For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.

16: 

[[2Pet.1.17|17]] For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

17: 

[[2Pet.1.18|18]] And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.

18: 

[[2Pet.1.19|19]] We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:

19: 

[[2Pet.1.20|20]] Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.

20: 

[[2Pet.1.21|21]] For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake \[as they were\] moved by the Holy Ghost.

21:
