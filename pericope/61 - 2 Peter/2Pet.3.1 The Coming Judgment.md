[[2Pet.3|2 Peter 3:1 - 2 Peter 3:7]]
*The Coming Judgment*

[[2Pet.3.1|1]] This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in \[both\] which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:

1: 

[[2Pet.3.2|2]] That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:

2: 

[[2Pet.3.3|3]] Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,

3: 

[[2Pet.3.4|4]] And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as \[they were\] from the beginning of the creation.

4: 

[[2Pet.3.5|5]] For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:

5: 

[[2Pet.3.6|6]] Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:

6: 

[[2Pet.3.7|7]] But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.

7:
