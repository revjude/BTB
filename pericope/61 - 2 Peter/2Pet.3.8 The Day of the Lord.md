[[2Pet.3|2 Peter 3:8 - 2 Peter 3:13]]
*The Day of the Lord*

[[2Pet.3.8|8]] But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day \[is\] with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.

8: 

[[2Pet.3.9|9]] The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

9: 

[[2Pet.3.10|10]] But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.

10: 

[[2Pet.3.11|11]] \[Seeing\] then \[that\] all these things shall be dissolved, what manner \[of persons\] ought ye to be in \[all\] holy conversation and godliness,

11: 

[[2Pet.3.12|12]] Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?

12: 

[[2Pet.3.13|13]] Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.

13:
