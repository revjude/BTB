[[Jude.1|Jude 1:17 - Jude 1:23]]
*A Call to Persevere*

[[Jude.1.17|17]] But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;

17: 

[[Jude.1.18|18]] How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.

18: 

[[Jude.1.19|19]] These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.

19: 

[[Jude.1.20|20]] But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,

20: 

[[Jude.1.21|21]] Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

21: 

[[Jude.1.22|22]] And of some have compassion, making a difference:

22: 

[[Jude.1.23|23]] And others save with fear, pulling \[them\] out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.

23:
