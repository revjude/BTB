[[1Thess.3|1 Thessalonians 3:1 - 1 Thessalonians 3:5]]
*Timothy’s Visit*

[[1Thess.3.1|1]] Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;

1: 

[[1Thess.3.2|2]] And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:

2: 

[[1Thess.3.3|3]] That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.

3: 

[[1Thess.3.4|4]] For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.

4: 

[[1Thess.3.5|5]] For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.

5:
