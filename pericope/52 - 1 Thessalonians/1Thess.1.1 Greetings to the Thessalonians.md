[[1Thess.1|1 Thessalonians 1:1 - 1 Thessalonians 1:10]]
*Greetings to the Thessalonians*

[[1Thess.1.1|1]] Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians \[which is\] in God the Father and \[in\] the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace \[be\] unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

1: 

[[1Thess.1.2|2]] We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;

2: 

[[1Thess.1.3|3]] Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;

3: 

[[1Thess.1.4|4]] Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.

4: 

[[1Thess.1.5|5]] For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.

5: 

[[1Thess.1.6|6]] And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:

6: 

[[1Thess.1.7|7]] So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.

7: 

[[1Thess.1.8|8]] For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.

8: 

[[1Thess.1.9|9]] For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;

9: 

[[1Thess.1.10|10]] And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, \[even\] Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.

10:
