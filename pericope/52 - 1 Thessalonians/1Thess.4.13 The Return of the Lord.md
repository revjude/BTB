[[1Thess.4|1 Thessalonians 4:13 - 1 Thessalonians 4:18]]
*The Return of the Lord*

[[1Thess.4.13|13]] But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.

13: 

[[1Thess.4.14|14]] For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.

14: 

[[1Thess.4.15|15]] For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive \[and\] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.

15: 

[[1Thess.4.16|16]] For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:

16: 

[[1Thess.4.17|17]] Then we which are alive \[and\] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

17: 

[[1Thess.4.18|18]] Wherefore comfort one another with these words.

18:
