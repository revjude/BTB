[[1Thess.5|1 Thessalonians 5:12 - 1 Thessalonians 5:22]]
*Christian Living*

[[1Thess.5.12|12]] And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;

12: 

[[1Thess.5.13|13]] And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. \[And\] be at peace among yourselves.

13: 

[[1Thess.5.14|14]] Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all \[men\].

14: 

[[1Thess.5.15|15]] See that none render evil for evil unto any \[man\]; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all \[men\].

15: 

[[1Thess.5.16|16]] Rejoice evermore.

16: 

[[1Thess.5.17|17]] Pray without ceasing.

17: 

[[1Thess.5.18|18]] In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.

18: 

[[1Thess.5.19|19]] Quench not the Spirit.

19: 

[[1Thess.5.20|20]] Despise not prophesyings.

20: 

[[1Thess.5.21|21]] Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.

21: 

[[1Thess.5.22|22]] Abstain from all appearance of evil.

22:
