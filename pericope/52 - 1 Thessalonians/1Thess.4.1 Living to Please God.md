[[1Thess.4|1 Thessalonians 4:1 - 1 Thessalonians 4:12]]
*Living to Please God*

[[1Thess.4.1|1]] Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort \[you\] by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, \[so\] ye would abound more and more.

1: 

[[1Thess.4.2|2]] For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.

2: 

[[1Thess.4.3|3]] For this is the will of God, \[even\] your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:

3: 

[[1Thess.4.4|4]] That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;

4: 

[[1Thess.4.5|5]] Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:

5: 

[[1Thess.4.6|6]] That no \[man\] go beyond and defraud his brother in \[any\] matter: because that the Lord \[is\] the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.

6: 

[[1Thess.4.7|7]] For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.

7: 

[[1Thess.4.8|8]] He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.

8: 

[[1Thess.4.9|9]] But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.

9: 

[[1Thess.4.10|10]] And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;

10: 

[[1Thess.4.11|11]] And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;

11: 

[[1Thess.4.12|12]] That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and \[that\] ye may have lack of nothing.

12:
