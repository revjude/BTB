[[1Thess.5|1 Thessalonians 5:1 - 1 Thessalonians 5:11]]
*The Day of the Lord*

[[1Thess.5.1|1]] But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.

1: 

[[1Thess.5.2|2]] For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.

2: 

[[1Thess.5.3|3]] For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.

3: 

[[1Thess.5.4|4]] But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.

4: 

[[1Thess.5.5|5]] Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.

5: 

[[1Thess.5.6|6]] Therefore let us not sleep, as \[do\] others; but let us watch and be sober.

6: 

[[1Thess.5.7|7]] For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.

7: 

[[1Thess.5.8|8]] But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.

8: 

[[1Thess.5.9|9]] For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,

9: 

[[1Thess.5.10|10]] Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.

10: 

[[1Thess.5.11|11]] Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.

11:
