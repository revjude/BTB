[[1Thess.2|1 Thessalonians 2:17 - 1 Thessalonians 2:20]]
*Paul’s Longing to Visit*

[[1Thess.2.17|17]] But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.

17: 

[[1Thess.2.18|18]] Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.

18: 

[[1Thess.2.19|19]] For what \[is\] our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? \[Are\] not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?

19: 

[[1Thess.2.20|20]] For ye are our glory and joy.

20:
