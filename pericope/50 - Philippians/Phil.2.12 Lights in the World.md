[[Phil.2|Philippians 2:12 - Philippians 2:18]]
*Lights in the World*

[[Phil.2.12|12]] Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.

12: 

[[Phil.2.13|13]] For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of \[his\] good pleasure.

13: 

[[Phil.2.14|14]] Do all things without murmurings and disputings:

14: 

[[Phil.2.15|15]] That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;

15: 

[[Phil.2.16|16]] Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.

16: 

[[Phil.2.17|17]] Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.

17: 

[[Phil.2.18|18]] For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.

18:
