[[Phil.4|Philippians 4:1 - Philippians 4:9]]
*Rejoice in the Lord*

[[Phil.4.1|1]] Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, \[my\] dearly beloved.

1: 

[[Phil.4.2|2]] I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.

2: 

[[Phil.4.3|3]] And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and \[with\] other my fellowlabourers, whose names \[are\] in the book of life.

3: 

[[Phil.4.4|4]] Rejoice in the Lord alway: \[and\] again I say, Rejoice.

4: 

[[Phil.4.5|5]] Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord \[is\] at hand.

5: 

[[Phil.4.6|6]] Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.

6: 

[[Phil.4.7|7]] And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

7: 

[[Phil.4.8|8]] Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things \[are\] honest, whatsoever things \[are\] just, whatsoever things \[are\] pure, whatsoever things \[are\] lovely, whatsoever things \[are\] of good report; if \[there be\] any virtue, and if \[there be\] any praise, think on these things.

8: 

[[Phil.4.9|9]] Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.

9:
