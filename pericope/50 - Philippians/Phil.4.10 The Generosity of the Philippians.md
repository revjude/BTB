[[Phil.4|Philippians 4:10 - Philippians 4:20]]
*The Generosity of the Philippians*

[[Phil.4.10|10]] But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.

10: 

[[Phil.4.11|11]] Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, \[therewith\] to be content.

11: 

[[Phil.4.12|12]] I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.

12: 

[[Phil.4.13|13]] I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.

13: 

[[Phil.4.14|14]] Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.

14: 

[[Phil.4.15|15]] Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.

15: 

[[Phil.4.16|16]] For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.

16: 

[[Phil.4.17|17]] Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.

17: 

[[Phil.4.18|18]] But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things \[which were sent\] from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.

18: 

[[Phil.4.19|19]] But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.

19: 

[[Phil.4.20|20]] Now unto God and our Father \[be\] glory for ever and ever. Amen.

20:
