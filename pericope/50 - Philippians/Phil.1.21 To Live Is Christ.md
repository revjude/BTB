[[Phil.1|Philippians 1:21 - Philippians 1:26]]
*To Live Is Christ*

[[Phil.1.21|21]] For to me to live \[is\] Christ, and to die \[is\] gain.

21: 

[[Phil.1.22|22]] But if I live in the flesh, this \[is\] the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.

22: 

[[Phil.1.23|23]] For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:

23: 

[[Phil.1.24|24]] Nevertheless to abide in the flesh \[is\] more needful for you.

24: 

[[Phil.1.25|25]] And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;

25: 

[[Phil.1.26|26]] That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.

26:
