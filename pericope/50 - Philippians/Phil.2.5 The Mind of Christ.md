[[Phil.2|Philippians 2:5 - Philippians 2:11]]
*The Mind of Christ*

[[Phil.2.5|5]] Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:

5: 

[[Phil.2.6|6]] Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:

6: 

[[Phil.2.7|7]] But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:

7: 

[[Phil.2.8|8]] And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

8: 

[[Phil.2.9|9]] Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:

9: 

[[Phil.2.10|10]] That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of \[things\] in heaven, and \[things\] in earth, and \[things\] under the earth;

10: 

[[Phil.2.11|11]] And \[that\] every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ \[is\] Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

11:
