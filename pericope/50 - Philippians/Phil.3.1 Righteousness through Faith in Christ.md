[[Phil.3|Philippians 3:1 - Philippians 3:11]]
*Righteousness through Faith in Christ*

[[Phil.3.1|1]] Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed \[is\] not grievous, but for you \[it is\] safe.

1: 

[[Phil.3.2|2]] Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.

2: 

[[Phil.3.3|3]] For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.

3: 

[[Phil.3.4|4]] Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:

4: 

[[Phil.3.5|5]] Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, \[of\] the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;

5: 

[[Phil.3.6|6]] Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.

6: 

[[Phil.3.7|7]] But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.

7: 

[[Phil.3.8|8]] Yea doubtless, and I count all things \[but\] loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them \[but\] dung, that I may win Christ,

8: 

[[Phil.3.9|9]] And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:

9: 

[[Phil.3.10|10]] That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;

10: 

[[Phil.3.11|11]] If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.

11:
