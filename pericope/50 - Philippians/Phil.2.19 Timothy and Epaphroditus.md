[[Phil.2|Philippians 2:19 - Philippians 2:30]]
*Timothy and Epaphroditus*

[[Phil.2.19|19]] But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.

19: 

[[Phil.2.20|20]] For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.

20: 

[[Phil.2.21|21]] For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s.

21: 

[[Phil.2.22|22]] But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.

22: 

[[Phil.2.23|23]] Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.

23: 

[[Phil.2.24|24]] But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.

24: 

[[Phil.2.25|25]] Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.

25: 

[[Phil.2.26|26]] For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.

26: 

[[Phil.2.27|27]] For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.

27: 

[[Phil.2.28|28]] I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.

28: 

[[Phil.2.29|29]] Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:

29: 

[[Phil.2.30|30]] Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.

30:
