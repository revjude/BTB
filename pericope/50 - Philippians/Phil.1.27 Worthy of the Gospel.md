[[Phil.1|Philippians 1:27 - Philippians 1:30]]
*Worthy of the Gospel*

[[Phil.1.27|27]] Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;

27: 

[[Phil.1.28|28]] And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.

28: 

[[Phil.1.29|29]] For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;

29: 

[[Phil.1.30|30]] Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear \[to be\] in me.

30:
