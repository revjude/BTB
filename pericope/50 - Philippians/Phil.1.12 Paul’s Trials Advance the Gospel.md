[[Phil.1|Philippians 1:12 - Philippians 1:20]]
*Paul’s Trials Advance the Gospel*

[[Phil.1.12|12]] But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things \[which happened\] unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;

12: 

[[Phil.1.13|13]] So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other \[places\];

13: 

[[Phil.1.14|14]] And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.

14: 

[[Phil.1.15|15]] Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:

15: 

[[Phil.1.16|16]] The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:

16: 

[[Phil.1.17|17]] But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.

17: 

[[Phil.1.18|18]] What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.

18: 

[[Phil.1.19|19]] For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

19: 

[[Phil.1.20|20]] According to my earnest expectation and \[my\] hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but \[that\] with all boldness, as always, \[so\] now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether \[it be\] by life, or by death.

20:
