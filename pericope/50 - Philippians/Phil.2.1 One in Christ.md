[[Phil.2|Philippians 2:1 - Philippians 2:4]]
*One in Christ*

[[Phil.2.1|1]] If \[there be\] therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,

1: 

[[Phil.2.2|2]] Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, \[being\] of one accord, of one mind.

2: 

[[Phil.2.3|3]] \[Let\] nothing \[be done\] through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.

3: 

[[Phil.2.4|4]] Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.

4:
