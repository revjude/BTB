[[Phil.3|Philippians 3:12 - Philippians 3:16]]
*Pressing on toward the Goal*

[[Phil.3.12|12]] Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.

12: 

[[Phil.3.13|13]] Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but \[this\] one thing \[I do\], forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,

13: 

[[Phil.3.14|14]] I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

14: 

[[Phil.3.15|15]] Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.

15: 

[[Phil.3.16|16]] Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.

16:
