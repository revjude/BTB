[[Phil.1|Philippians 1:3 - Philippians 1:11]]
*Thanksgiving and Prayer*

[[Phil.1.3|3]] I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,

3: 

[[Phil.1.4|4]] Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,

4: 

[[Phil.1.5|5]] For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;

5: 

[[Phil.1.6|6]] Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform \[it\] until the day of Jesus Christ:

6: 

[[Phil.1.7|7]] Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.

7: 

[[Phil.1.8|8]] For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.

8: 

[[Phil.1.9|9]] And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and \[in\] all judgment;

9: 

[[Phil.1.10|10]] That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;

10: 

[[Phil.1.11|11]] Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.

11:
