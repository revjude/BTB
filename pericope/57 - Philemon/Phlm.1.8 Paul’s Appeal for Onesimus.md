[[Phlm.1|Philemon 1:8 - Philemon 1:22]]
*Paul’s Appeal for Onesimus*

[[Phlm.1.8|8]] Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,

8: 

[[Phlm.1.9|9]] Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech \[thee\], being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

9: 

[[Phlm.1.10|10]] I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:

10: 

[[Phlm.1.11|11]] Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:

11: 

[[Phlm.1.12|12]] Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:

12: 

[[Phlm.1.13|13]] Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:

13: 

[[Phlm.1.14|14]] But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.

14: 

[[Phlm.1.15|15]] For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;

15: 

[[Phlm.1.16|16]] Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?

16: 

[[Phlm.1.17|17]] If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.

17: 

[[Phlm.1.18|18]] If he hath wronged thee, or oweth \[thee\] ought, put that on mine account;

18: 

[[Phlm.1.19|19]] I Paul have written \[it\] with mine own hand, I will repay \[it\]: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.

19: 

[[Phlm.1.20|20]] Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.

20: 

[[Phlm.1.21|21]] Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.

21: 

[[Phlm.1.22|22]] But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.

22:
