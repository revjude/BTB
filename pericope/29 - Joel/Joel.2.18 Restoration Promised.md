[[Joel.2|Joel 2:18 - Joel 2:27]]
*Restoration Promised*

[[Joel.2.18|18]] Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people.

18: 

[[Joel.2.19|19]] Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen:

19: 

[[Joel.2.20|20]] But I will remove far off from you the northern \[army\], and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great things.

20: 

[[Joel.2.21|21]] Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great things.

21: 

[[Joel.2.22|22]] Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength.

22: 

[[Joel.2.23|23]] Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first \[month\].

23: 

[[Joel.2.24|24]] And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil.

24: 

[[Joel.2.25|25]] And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.

25: 

[[Joel.2.26|26]] And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.

26: 

[[Joel.2.27|27]] And ye shall know that I \[am\] in the midst of Israel, and \[that\] I \[am\] the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.

27:
