[[Joel.1|Joel 1:13 - Joel 1:20]]
*A Call to Repentance*

[[Joel.1.13|13]] Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.

13: 

[[Joel.1.14|14]] Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders \[and\] all the inhabitants of the land \[into\] the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto the LORD,

14: 

[[Joel.1.15|15]] Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD \[is\] at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.

15: 

[[Joel.1.16|16]] Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, \[yea\], joy and gladness from the house of our God?

16: 

[[Joel.1.17|17]] The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.

17: 

[[Joel.1.18|18]] How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.

18: 

[[Joel.1.19|19]] O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.

19: 

[[Joel.1.20|20]] The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.

20:
