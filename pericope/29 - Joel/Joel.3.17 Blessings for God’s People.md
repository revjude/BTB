[[Joel.3|Joel 3:17 - Joel 3:21]]
*Blessings for God’s People*

[[Joel.3.17|17]] So shall ye know that I \[am\] the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.

17: 

[[Joel.3.18|18]] And it shall come to pass in that day, \[that\] the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.

18: 

[[Joel.3.19|19]] Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence \[against\] the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.

19: 

[[Joel.3.20|20]] But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.

20: 

[[Joel.3.21|21]] For I will cleanse their blood \[that\] I have not cleansed: for the LORD dwelleth in Zion.

21:
