[[Joel.2|Joel 2:12 - Joel 2:17]]
*Return with All Your Heart*

[[Joel.2.12|12]] Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye \[even\] to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:

12: 

[[Joel.2.13|13]] And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he \[is\] gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.

13: 

[[Joel.2.14|14]] Who knoweth \[if\] he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; \[even\] a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God?

14: 

[[Joel.2.15|15]] Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:

15: 

[[Joel.2.16|16]] Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.

16: 

[[Joel.2.17|17]] Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where \[is\] their God?

17:
