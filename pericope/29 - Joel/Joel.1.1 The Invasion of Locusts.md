[[Joel.1|Joel 1:1 - Joel 1:7]]
*The Invasion of Locusts*

[[Joel.1.1|1]] The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.

1: 

[[Joel.1.2|2]] Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?

2: 

[[Joel.1.3|3]] Tell ye your children of it, and \[let\] your children \[tell\] their children, and their children another generation.

3: 

[[Joel.1.4|4]] That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.

4: 

[[Joel.1.5|5]] Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.

5: 

[[Joel.1.6|6]] For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth \[are\] the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.

6: 

[[Joel.1.7|7]] He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast \[it\] away; the branches thereof are made white.

7:
