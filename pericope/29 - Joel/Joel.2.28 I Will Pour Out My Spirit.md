[[Joel.2|Joel 2:28 - Joel 2:32]]
*I Will Pour Out My Spirit*

[[Joel.2.28|28]] And it shall come to pass afterward, \[that\] I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:

28: 

[[Joel.2.29|29]] And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.

29: 

[[Joel.2.30|30]] And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.

30: 

[[Joel.2.31|31]] The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come.

31: 

[[Joel.2.32|32]] And it shall come to pass, \[that\] whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call.

32:
