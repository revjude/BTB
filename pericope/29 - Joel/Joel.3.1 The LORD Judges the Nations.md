[[Joel.3|Joel 3:1 - Joel 3:16]]
*The LORD Judges the Nations*

[[Joel.3.1|1]] For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,

1: 

[[Joel.3.2|2]] I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and \[for\] my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.

2: 

[[Joel.3.3|3]] And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.

3: 

[[Joel.3.4|4]] Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and if ye recompense me, swiftly \[and\] speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head;

4: 

[[Joel.3.5|5]] Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things:

5: 

[[Joel.3.6|6]] The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border.

6: 

[[Joel.3.7|7]] Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head:

7: 

[[Joel.3.8|8]] And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off: for the LORD hath spoken \[it\].

8: 

[[Joel.3.9|9]] Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:

9: 

[[Joel.3.10|10]] Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I \[am\] strong.

10: 

[[Joel.3.11|11]] Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD.

11: 

[[Joel.3.12|12]] Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about.

12: 

[[Joel.3.13|13]] Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness \[is\] great.

13: 

[[Joel.3.14|14]] Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the LORD \[is\] near in the valley of decision.

14: 

[[Joel.3.15|15]] The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.

15: 

[[Joel.3.16|16]] The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the LORD \[will be\] the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.

16:
