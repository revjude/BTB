[[Joel.2|Joel 2:1 - Joel 2:11]]
*The Army of Locusts*

[[Joel.2.1|1]] Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD cometh, for \[it is\] nigh at hand;

1: 

[[Joel.2.2|2]] A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, \[even\] to the years of many generations.

2: 

[[Joel.2.3|3]] A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land \[is\] as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.

3: 

[[Joel.2.4|4]] The appearance of them \[is\] as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run.

4: 

[[Joel.2.5|5]] Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.

5: 

[[Joel.2.6|6]] Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness.

6: 

[[Joel.2.7|7]] They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks:

7: 

[[Joel.2.8|8]] Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path: and \[when\] they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded.

8: 

[[Joel.2.9|9]] They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief.

9: 

[[Joel.2.10|10]] The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:

10: 

[[Joel.2.11|11]] And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp \[is\] very great: for \[he is\] strong that executeth his word: for the day of the LORD \[is\] great and very terrible; and who can abide it?

11:
