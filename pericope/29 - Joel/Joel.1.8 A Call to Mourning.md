[[Joel.1|Joel 1:8 - Joel 1:12]]
*A Call to Mourning*

[[Joel.1.8|8]] Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.

8: 

[[Joel.1.9|9]] The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD’S ministers, mourn.

9: 

[[Joel.1.10|10]] The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.

10: 

[[Joel.1.11|11]] Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.

11: 

[[Joel.1.12|12]] The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, \[even\] all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.

12:
