[[2Tim.3|2 Timothy 3:10 - 2 Timothy 3:17]]
*All Scripture Is God-Breathed*

[[2Tim.3.10|10]] But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,

10: 

[[2Tim.3.11|11]] Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of \[them\] all the Lord delivered me.

11: 

[[2Tim.3.12|12]] Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

12: 

[[2Tim.3.13|13]] But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.

13: 

[[2Tim.3.14|14]] But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned \[them\];

14: 

[[2Tim.3.15|15]] And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

15: 

[[2Tim.3.16|16]] All scripture \[is\] given by inspiration of God, and \[is\] profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:

16: 

[[2Tim.3.17|17]] That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.

17:
