[[2Tim.1|2 Timothy 1:13 - 2 Timothy 1:18]]
*Holding to Sound Teaching*

[[2Tim.1.13|13]] Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

13: 

[[2Tim.1.14|14]] That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.

14: 

[[2Tim.1.15|15]] This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.

15: 

[[2Tim.1.16|16]] The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:

16: 

[[2Tim.1.17|17]] But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found \[me\].

17: 

[[2Tim.1.18|18]] The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.

18:
