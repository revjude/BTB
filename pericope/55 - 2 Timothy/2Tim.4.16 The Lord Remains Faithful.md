[[2Tim.4|2 Timothy 4:16 - 2 Timothy 4:18]]
*The Lord Remains Faithful*

[[2Tim.4.16|16]] At my first answer no man stood with me, but all \[men\] forsook me: \[I pray God\] that it may not be laid to their charge.

16: 

[[2Tim.4.17|17]] Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and \[that\] all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

17: 

[[2Tim.4.18|18]] And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve \[me\] unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom \[be\] glory for ever and ever. Amen.

18:
