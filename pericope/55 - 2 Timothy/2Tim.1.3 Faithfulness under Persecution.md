[[2Tim.1|2 Timothy 1:3 - 2 Timothy 1:12]]
*Faithfulness under Persecution*

[[2Tim.1.3|3]] I thank God, whom I serve from \[my\] forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;

3: 

[[2Tim.1.4|4]] Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;

4: 

[[2Tim.1.5|5]] When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.

5: 

[[2Tim.1.6|6]] Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.

6: 

[[2Tim.1.7|7]] For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.

7: 

[[2Tim.1.8|8]] Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;

8: 

[[2Tim.1.9|9]] Who hath saved us, and called \[us\] with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,

9: 

[[2Tim.1.10|10]] But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:

10: 

[[2Tim.1.11|11]] Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.

11: 

[[2Tim.1.12|12]] For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.

12:
