[[2Tim.4|2 Timothy 4:1 - 2 Timothy 4:8]]
*Preach the Word*

[[2Tim.4.1|1]] I charge \[thee\] therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;

1: 

[[2Tim.4.2|2]] Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.

2: 

[[2Tim.4.3|3]] For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;

3: 

[[2Tim.4.4|4]] And they shall turn away \[their\] ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.

4: 

[[2Tim.4.5|5]] But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.

5: 

[[2Tim.4.6|6]] For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.

6: 

[[2Tim.4.7|7]] I have fought a good fight, I have finished \[my\] course, I have kept the faith:

7: 

[[2Tim.4.8|8]] Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.

8:
