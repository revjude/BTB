[[2Tim.4|2 Timothy 4:9 - 2 Timothy 4:15]]
*Personal Concerns*

[[2Tim.4.9|9]] Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:

9: 

[[2Tim.4.10|10]] For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.

10: 

[[2Tim.4.11|11]] Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.

11: 

[[2Tim.4.12|12]] And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.

12: 

[[2Tim.4.13|13]] The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring \[with thee\], and the books, \[but\] especially the parchments.

13: 

[[2Tim.4.14|14]] Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:

14: 

[[2Tim.4.15|15]] Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.

15:
