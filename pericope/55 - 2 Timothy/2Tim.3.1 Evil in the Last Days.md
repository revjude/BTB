[[2Tim.3|2 Timothy 3:1 - 2 Timothy 3:9]]
*Evil in the Last Days*

[[2Tim.3.1|1]] This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.

1: 

[[2Tim.3.2|2]] For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,

2: 

[[2Tim.3.3|3]] Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,

3: 

[[2Tim.3.4|4]] Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;

4: 

[[2Tim.3.5|5]] Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.

5: 

[[2Tim.3.6|6]] For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,

6: 

[[2Tim.3.7|7]] Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

7: 

[[2Tim.3.8|8]] Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.

8: 

[[2Tim.3.9|9]] But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all \[men\], as theirs also was.

9:
