[[2Tim.2|2 Timothy 2:1 - 2 Timothy 2:13]]
*Grace and Perseverance*

[[2Tim.2.1|1]] Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

1: 

[[2Tim.2.2|2]] And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.

2: 

[[2Tim.2.3|3]] Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

3: 

[[2Tim.2.4|4]] No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of \[this\] life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

4: 

[[2Tim.2.5|5]] And if a man also strive for masteries, \[yet\] is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.

5: 

[[2Tim.2.6|6]] The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.

6: 

[[2Tim.2.7|7]] Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.

7: 

[[2Tim.2.8|8]] Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:

8: 

[[2Tim.2.9|9]] Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, \[even\] unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.

9: 

[[2Tim.2.10|10]] Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

10: 

[[2Tim.2.11|11]] \[It is\] a faithful saying: For if we be dead with \[him\], we shall also live with \[him\]:

11: 

[[2Tim.2.12|12]] If we suffer, we shall also reign with \[him\]: if we deny \[him\], he also will deny us:

12: 

[[2Tim.2.13|13]] If we believe not, \[yet\] he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.

13:
