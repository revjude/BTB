[[Song.2|Song of Solomon 2:16 - Song of Solomon 2:17]]
*The Bride*

[[Song.2.16|16]] My beloved \[is\] mine, and I \[am\] his: he feedeth among the lilies.

16: 

[[Song.2.17|17]] Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.

17:
