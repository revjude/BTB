[[Song.1|Song of Solomon 1:5 - Song of Solomon 1:7]]
*The Bride*

[[Song.1.5|5]] I \[am\] black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.

5: 

[[Song.1.6|6]] Look not upon me, because I \[am\] black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother’s children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; \[but\] mine own vineyard have I not kept.

6: 

[[Song.1.7|7]] Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest \[thy flock\] to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?

7:
