[[Song.1|Song of Solomon 1:12 - Song of Solomon 1:14]]
*The Bride*

[[Song.1.12|12]] While the king \[sitteth\] at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.

12: 

[[Song.1.13|13]] A bundle of myrrh \[is\] my wellbeloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.

13: 

[[Song.1.14|14]] My beloved \[is\] unto me \[as\] a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.

14:
