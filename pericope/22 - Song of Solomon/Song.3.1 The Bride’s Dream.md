[[Song.3|Song of Solomon 3:1 - Song of Solomon 3:5]]
*The Bride’s Dream*

[[Song.3.1|1]] By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.

1: 

[[Song.3.2|2]] I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.

2: 

[[Song.3.3|3]] The watchmen that go about the city found me: \[to whom I said\], Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?

3: 

[[Song.3.4|4]] \[It was\] but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother’s house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.

4: 

[[Song.3.5|5]] I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake \[my\] love, till he please.

5:
