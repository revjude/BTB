[[Song.2|Song of Solomon 2:3 - Song of Solomon 2:13]]
*The Bride*

[[Song.2.3|3]] As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so \[is\] my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit \[was\] sweet to my taste.

3: 

[[Song.2.4|4]] He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me \[was\] love.

4: 

[[Song.2.5|5]] Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I \[am\] sick of love.

5: 

[[Song.2.6|6]] His left hand \[is\] under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.

6: 

[[Song.2.7|7]] I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake \[my\] love, till he please.

7: 

[[Song.2.8|8]] The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.

8: 

[[Song.2.9|9]] My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.

9: 

[[Song.2.10|10]] My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.

10: 

[[Song.2.11|11]] For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over \[and\] gone;

11: 

[[Song.2.12|12]] The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing \[of birds\] is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;

12: 

[[Song.2.13|13]] The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines \[with\] the tender grape give a \[good\] smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.

13:
