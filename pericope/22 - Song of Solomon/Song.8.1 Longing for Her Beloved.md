[[Song.8|Song of Solomon 8:1 - Song of Solomon 8:4]]
*Longing for Her Beloved*

[[Song.8.1|1]] O that thou \[wert\] as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! \[when\] I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.

1: 

[[Song.8.2|2]] I would lead thee, \[and\] bring thee into my mother’s house, \[who\] would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.

2: 

[[Song.8.3|3]] His left hand \[should be\] under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.

3: 

[[Song.8.4|4]] I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake \[my\] love, until he please.

4:
