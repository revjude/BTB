[[Song.7|Song of Solomon 7:1 - Song of Solomon 7:9]]
*Admiration by the Bridegroom*

[[Song.7.1|1]] How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince’s daughter! the joints of thy thighs \[are\] like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.

1: 

[[Song.7.2|2]] Thy navel \[is like\] a round goblet, \[which\] wanteth not liquor: thy belly \[is like\] an heap of wheat set about with lilies.

2: 

[[Song.7.3|3]] Thy two breasts \[are\] like two young roes \[that are\] twins.

3: 

[[Song.7.4|4]] Thy neck \[is\] as a tower of ivory; thine eyes \[like\] the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose \[is\] as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.

4: 

[[Song.7.5|5]] Thine head upon thee \[is\] like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king \[is\] held in the galleries.

5: 

[[Song.7.6|6]] How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!

6: 

[[Song.7.7|7]] This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters \[of grapes\].

7: 

[[Song.7.8|8]] I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;

8: 

[[Song.7.9|9]] And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth \[down\] sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.

9:
