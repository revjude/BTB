*Solomon Arrives on His Wedding Day*

[[Song.3.6|6]] Who \[is\] this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?

6: 

[[Song.3.7|7]] Behold his bed, which \[is\] Solomon’s; threescore valiant men \[are\] about it, of the valiant of Israel.

7: 

[[Song.3.8|8]] They all hold swords, \[being\] expert in war: every man \[hath\] his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.

8: 

[[Song.3.9|9]] King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.

9: 

[[Song.3.10|10]] He made the pillars thereof \[of\] silver, the bottom thereof \[of\] gold, the covering of it \[of\] purple, the midst thereof being paved \[with\] love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.
