[[Song.5|Song of Solomon 5:2 - Song of Solomon 5:8]]
*The Bride*

[[Song.5.2|2]] I sleep, but my heart waketh: \[it is\] the voice of my beloved that knocketh, \[saying\], Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, \[and\] my locks with the drops of the night.

2: 

[[Song.5.3|3]] I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?

3: 

[[Song.5.4|4]] My beloved put in his hand by the hole \[of the door\], and my bowels were moved for him.

4: 

[[Song.5.5|5]] I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped \[with\] myrrh, and my fingers \[with\] sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.

5: 

[[Song.5.6|6]] I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, \[and\] was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.

6: 

[[Song.5.7|7]] The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.

7: 

[[Song.5.8|8]] I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I \[am\] sick of love.

8:
