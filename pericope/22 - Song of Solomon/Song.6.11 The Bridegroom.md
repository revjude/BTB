[[Song.6|Song of Solomon 6:11 - Song of Solomon 6:12]]
*The Bridegroom*

[[Song.6.11|11]] I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, \[and\] to see whether the vine flourished, \[and\] the pomegranates budded.

11: 

[[Song.6.12|12]] Or ever I was aware, my soul made me \[like\] the chariots of Amminadib.

12:
