[[Song.8|Song of Solomon 8:10 - Song of Solomon 8:12]]
*The Bride*

[[Song.8.10|10]] I \[am\] a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.

10: 

[[Song.8.11|11]] Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand \[pieces\] of silver.

11: 

[[Song.8.12|12]] My vineyard, which \[is\] mine, \[is\] before me: thou, O Solomon, \[must have\] a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.

12:
