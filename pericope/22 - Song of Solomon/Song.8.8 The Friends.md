[[Song.8|Song of Solomon 8:8 - Song of Solomon 8:9]]
*The Friends*

[[Song.8.8|8]] We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?

8: 

[[Song.8.9|9]] If she \[be\] a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she \[be\] a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.

9:
