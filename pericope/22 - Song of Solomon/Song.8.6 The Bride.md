[[Song.8|Song of Solomon 8:6 - Song of Solomon 8:7]]
*The Bride*

[[Song.8.6|6]] Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love \[is\] strong as death; jealousy \[is\] cruel as the grave: the coals thereof \[are\] coals of fire, \[which hath\] a most vehement flame.

6: 

[[Song.8.7|7]] Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.

7:
