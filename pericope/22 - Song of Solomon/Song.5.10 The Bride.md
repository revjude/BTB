[[Song.5|Song of Solomon 5:10 - Song of Solomon 5:16]]
*The Bride*

[[Song.5.10|10]] My beloved \[is\] white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.

10: 

[[Song.5.11|11]] His head \[is as\] the most fine gold, his locks \[are\] bushy, \[and\] black as a raven.

11: 

[[Song.5.12|12]] His eyes \[are\] as \[the eyes\] of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, \[and\] fitly set.

12: 

[[Song.5.13|13]] His cheeks \[are\] as a bed of spices, \[as\] sweet flowers: his lips \[like\] lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.

13: 

[[Song.5.14|14]] His hands \[are as\] gold rings set with the beryl: his belly \[is as\] bright ivory overlaid \[with\] sapphires.

14: 

[[Song.5.15|15]] His legs \[are as\] pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance \[is\] as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.

15: 

[[Song.5.16|16]] His mouth \[is\] most sweet: yea, he \[is\] altogether lovely. This \[is\] my beloved, and this \[is\] my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.

16:
