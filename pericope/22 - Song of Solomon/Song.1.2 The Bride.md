[[Song.1.3|3]] Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name \[is as\] ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.

[[Song.1.4|4]] Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.
