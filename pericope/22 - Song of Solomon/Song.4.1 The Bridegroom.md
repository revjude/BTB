[[Song.4|Song of Solomon 4:1 - Song of Solomon 4:15]]
*The Bridegroom*

[[Song.4.1|1]] Behold, thou \[art\] fair, my love; behold, thou \[art\] fair; thou \[hast\] doves’ eyes within thy locks: thy hair \[is\] as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.

1: 

[[Song.4.2|2]] Thy teeth \[are\] like a flock \[of sheep that are even\] shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none \[is\] barren among them.

2: 

[[Song.4.3|3]] Thy lips \[are\] like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech \[is\] comely: thy temples \[are\] like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.

3: 

[[Song.4.4|4]] Thy neck \[is\] like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.

4: 

[[Song.4.5|5]] Thy two breasts \[are\] like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.

5: 

[[Song.4.6|6]] Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.

6: 

[[Song.4.7|7]] Thou \[art\] all fair, my love; \[there is\] no spot in thee.

7: 

[[Song.4.8|8]] Come with me from Lebanon, \[my\] spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions’ dens, from the mountains of the leopards.

8: 

[[Song.4.9|9]] Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, \[my\] spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.

9: 

[[Song.4.10|10]] How fair is thy love, my sister, \[my\] spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!

10: 

[[Song.4.11|11]] Thy lips, O \[my\] spouse, drop \[as\] the honeycomb: honey and milk \[are\] under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments \[is\] like the smell of Lebanon.

11: 

[[Song.4.12|12]] A garden inclosed \[is\] my sister, \[my\] spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.

12: 

[[Song.4.13|13]] Thy plants \[are\] an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,

13: 

[[Song.4.14|14]] Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:

14: 

[[Song.4.15|15]] A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.

15:
