[[Song.5|Song of Solomon 5:1 - Song of Solomon 5:1]]
*The Bridegroom*

[[Song.5.1|1]] I am come into my garden, my sister, \[my\] spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.
