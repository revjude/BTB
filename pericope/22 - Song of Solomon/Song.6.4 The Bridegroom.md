[[Song.6|Song of Solomon 6:4 - Song of Solomon 6:9]]
*The Bridegroom*

[[Song.6.4|4]] Thou \[art\] beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as \[an army\] with banners.

4: 

[[Song.6.5|5]] Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair \[is\] as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.

5: 

[[Song.6.6|6]] Thy teeth \[are\] as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and \[there is\] not one barren among them.

6: 

[[Song.6.7|7]] As a piece of a pomegranate \[are\] thy temples within thy locks.

7: 

[[Song.6.8|8]] There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.

8: 

[[Song.6.9|9]] My dove, my undefiled is \[but\] one; she \[is\] the \[only\] one of her mother, she \[is\] the choice \[one\] of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; \[yea\], the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.

9:
