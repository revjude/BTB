[[Song.7|Song of Solomon 7:10 - Song of Solomon 7:13]]
*The Bride*

[[Song.7.10|10]] I \[am\] my beloved’s, and his desire \[is\] toward me.

10: 

[[Song.7.11|11]] Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.

11: 

[[Song.7.12|12]] Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, \[whether\] the tender grape appear, \[and\] the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.

12: 

[[Song.7.13|13]] The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates \[are\] all manner of pleasant \[fruits\], new and old, \[which\] I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.

13:
