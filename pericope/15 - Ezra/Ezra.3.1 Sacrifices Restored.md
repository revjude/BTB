[[Ezra.3|Ezra 3:1 - Ezra 3:7]]
*Sacrifices Restored*

[[Ezra.3.1|1]] And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel \[were\] in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.

1: 

[[Ezra.3.2|2]] Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as \[it is\] written in the law of Moses the man of God.

2: 

[[Ezra.3.3|3]] And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear \[was\] upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, \[even\] burnt offerings morning and evening.

3: 

[[Ezra.3.4|4]] They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as \[it is\] written, and \[offered\] the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;

4: 

[[Ezra.3.5|5]] And afterward \[offered\] the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD.

5: 

[[Ezra.3.6|6]] From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not \[yet\] laid.

6: 

[[Ezra.3.7|7]] They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
