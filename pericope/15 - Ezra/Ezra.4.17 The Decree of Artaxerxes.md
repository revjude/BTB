[[Ezra.4|Ezra 4:17 - Ezra 4:24]]
*The Decree of Artaxerxes*

[[Ezra.4.17|17]] \[Then\] sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and \[to\] Shimshai the scribe, and \[to\] the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and \[unto\] the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.

17: 

[[Ezra.4.18|18]] The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.

18: 

[[Ezra.4.19|19]] And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and \[that\] rebellion and sedition have been made therein.

19: 

[[Ezra.4.20|20]] There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all \[countries\] beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.

20: 

[[Ezra.4.21|21]] Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until \[another\] commandment shall be given from me.

21: 

[[Ezra.4.22|22]] Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?

22: 

[[Ezra.4.23|23]] Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes’ letter \[was\] read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.

23: 

[[Ezra.4.24|24]] Then ceased the work of the house of God which \[is\] at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.

24:
