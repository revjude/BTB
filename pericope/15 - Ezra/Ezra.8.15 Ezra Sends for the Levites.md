*Ezra Sends for the Levites*

[[Ezra.8.15|15]] And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.

15: 

[[Ezra.8.16|16]] Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.

16: 

[[Ezra.8.17|17]] And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, \[and\] to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.

17: 

[[Ezra.8.18|18]] And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;

18: 

[[Ezra.8.19|19]] And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;

19: 

[[Ezra.8.20|20]] Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.

20:
