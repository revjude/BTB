[[Ezra.6|Ezra 6:19 - Ezra 6:22]]
*The Returned Exiles Keep the Passover*

[[Ezra.6.19|19]] And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth \[day\] of the first month.

19: 

[[Ezra.6.20|20]] For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them \[were\] pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.

20: 

[[Ezra.6.21|21]] And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,

21: 

[[Ezra.6.22|22]] And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.

22:
