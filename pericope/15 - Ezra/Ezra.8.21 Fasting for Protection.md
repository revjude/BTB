[[Ezra.8|Ezra 8:21 - Ezra 8:23]]
*Fasting for Protection*

[[Ezra.8.21|21]] Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.

21: 

[[Ezra.8.22|22]] For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God \[is\] upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath \[is\] against all them that forsake him.

22: 

[[Ezra.8.23|23]] So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us.

23:
