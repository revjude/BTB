[[Ezra.8|Ezra 8:24 - Ezra 8:31]]
*Priests to Guard the Offerings*

[[Ezra.8.24|24]] Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,

24: 

[[Ezra.8.25|25]] And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, \[even\] the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellers, and his lords, and all Israel \[there\] present, had offered:

25: 

[[Ezra.8.26|26]] I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, \[and\] of gold an hundred talents;

26: 

[[Ezra.8.27|27]] Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.

27: 

[[Ezra.8.28|28]] And I said unto them, Ye \[are\] holy unto the LORD; the vessels \[are\] holy also; and the silver and the gold \[are\] a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers.

28: 

[[Ezra.8.29|29]] Watch ye, and keep \[them\], until ye weigh \[them\] before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.

29: 

[[Ezra.8.30|30]] So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring \[them\] to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.

30: 

[[Ezra.8.31|31]] Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth \[day\] of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.

31:
