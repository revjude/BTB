[[Ezra.3|Ezra 3:8 - Ezra 3:13]]
*Temple Restoration Begins*

[[Ezra.3.8|8]] Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.

8: 

[[Ezra.3.9|9]] Then stood Jeshua \[with\] his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, \[with\] their sons and their brethren the Levites.

9: 

[[Ezra.3.10|10]] And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.

10: 

[[Ezra.3.11|11]] And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because \[he is\] good, for his mercy \[endureth\] for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.

11: 

[[Ezra.3.12|12]] But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, \[who were\] ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:

12: 

[[Ezra.3.13|13]] So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.

13:
