[[Ezra.4|Ezra 4:6 - Ezra 4:16]]
*Opposition under Xerxes and Artaxerxes*

[[Ezra.4.6|6]] And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they \[unto him\] an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.

6: 

[[Ezra.4.7|7]] And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter \[was\] written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.

7: 

[[Ezra.4.8|8]] Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:

8: 

[[Ezra.4.9|9]] Then \[wrote\] Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, \[and\] the Elamites,

9: 

[[Ezra.4.10|10]] And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnappar brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest \[that are\] on this side the river, and at such a time.

10: 

[[Ezra.4.11|11]] This \[is\] the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, \[even\] unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time.

11: 

[[Ezra.4.12|12]] Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls \[thereof\], and joined the foundations.

12: 

[[Ezra.4.13|13]] Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up \[again, then\] will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and \[so\] thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.

13: 

[[Ezra.4.14|14]] Now because we have maintenance from \[the king’s\] palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king’s dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king;

14: 

[[Ezra.4.15|15]] That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city \[is\] a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.

15: 

[[Ezra.4.16|16]] We certify the king that, if this city be builded \[again\], and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.

16:
