[[Ezra.7|Ezra 7:11 - Ezra 7:26]]
*Artaxerxes’ Letter for Ezra*

[[Ezra.7.11|11]] Now this \[is\] the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, \[even\] a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel.

11: 

[[Ezra.7.12|12]] Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect \[peace\], and at such a time.

12: 

[[Ezra.7.13|13]] I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and \[of\] his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee.

13: 

[[Ezra.7.14|14]] Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellers, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which \[is\] in thine hand;

14: 

[[Ezra.7.15|15]] And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellers have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation \[is\] in Jerusalem,

15: 

[[Ezra.7.16|16]] And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which \[is\] in Jerusalem:

16: 

[[Ezra.7.17|17]] That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which \[is\] in Jerusalem.

17: 

[[Ezra.7.18|18]] And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God.

18: 

[[Ezra.7.19|19]] The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, \[those\] deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem.

19: 

[[Ezra.7.20|20]] And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow \[it\] out of the king’s treasure house.

20: 

[[Ezra.7.21|21]] And I, \[even\] I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers which \[are\] beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily,

21: 

[[Ezra.7.22|22]] Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing \[how much\].

22: 

[[Ezra.7.23|23]] Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?

23: 

[[Ezra.7.24|24]] Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them.

24: 

[[Ezra.7.25|25]] And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that \[is\] in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that \[are\] beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know \[them\] not.

25: 

[[Ezra.7.26|26]] And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether \[it be\] unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.

26:
