[[Ezra.7|Ezra 7:27 - Ezra 7:28]]
*Ezra Blesses God*

[[Ezra.7.27|27]] Blessed \[be\] the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put \[such a thing\] as this in the king’s heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which \[is\] in Jerusalem:

27: 

[[Ezra.7.28|28]] And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellers, and before all the king’s mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God \[was\] upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.

28:
