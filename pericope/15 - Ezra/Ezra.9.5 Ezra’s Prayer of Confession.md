[[Ezra.9|Ezra 9:5 - Ezra 9:15]]
*Ezra’s Prayer of Confession*

[[Ezra.9.5|5]] And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God,

5: 

[[Ezra.9.6|6]] And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over \[our\] head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens.

6: 

[[Ezra.9.7|7]] Since the days of our fathers \[have\] we \[been\] in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, \[and\] our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as \[it is\] this day.

7: 

[[Ezra.9.8|8]] And now for a little space grace hath been \[shewed\] from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.

8: 

[[Ezra.9.9|9]] For we \[were\] bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.

9: 

[[Ezra.9.10|10]] And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,

10: 

[[Ezra.9.11|11]] Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.

11: 

[[Ezra.9.12|12]] Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave \[it\] for an inheritance to your children for ever.

12: 

[[Ezra.9.13|13]] And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities \[deserve\], and hast given us \[such\] deliverance as this;

13: 

[[Ezra.9.14|14]] Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed \[us\], so that \[there should be\] no remnant nor escaping?

14: 

[[Ezra.9.15|15]] O LORD God of Israel, thou \[art\] righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as \[it is\] this day: behold, we \[are\] before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this.

15:
