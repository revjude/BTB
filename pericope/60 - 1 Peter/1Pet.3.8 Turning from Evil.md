[[1Pet.3|1 Peter 3:8 - 1 Peter 3:13]]
*Turning from Evil*

[[1Pet.3.8|8]] Finally, \[be ye\] all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, \[be\] pitiful, \[be\] courteous:

8: 

[[1Pet.3.9|9]] Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.

9: 

[[1Pet.3.10|10]] For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:

10: 

[[1Pet.3.11|11]] Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.

11: 

[[1Pet.3.12|12]] For the eyes of the Lord \[are\] over the righteous, and his ears \[are open\] unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord \[is\] against them that do evil.

12: 

[[1Pet.3.13|13]] And who \[is\] he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?

13:
