[[1Pet.1|1 Peter 1:22 - 1 Peter 1:25]]
*The Enduring Word*

[[1Pet.1.22|22]] Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, \[see that ye\] love one another with a pure heart fervently:

22: 

[[1Pet.1.23|23]] Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.

23: 

[[1Pet.1.24|24]] For all flesh \[is\] as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:

24: 

[[1Pet.1.25|25]] But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.

25:
