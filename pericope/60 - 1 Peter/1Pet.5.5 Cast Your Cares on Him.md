[[1Pet.5|1 Peter 5:5 - 1 Peter 5:9]]
*Cast Your Cares on Him*

[[1Pet.5.5|5]] Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all \[of you\] be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.

5: 

[[1Pet.5.6|6]] Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:

6: 

[[1Pet.5.7|7]] Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.

7: 

[[1Pet.5.8|8]] Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:

8: 

[[1Pet.5.9|9]] Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.

9:
