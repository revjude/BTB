[[1Pet.5|1 Peter 5:1 - 1 Peter 5:4]]
*Instructions to Elders*

[[1Pet.5.1|1]] The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:

1: 

[[1Pet.5.2|2]] Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight \[thereof\], not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;

2: 

[[1Pet.5.3|3]] Neither as being lords over \[God’s\] heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.

3: 

[[1Pet.5.4|4]] And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.

4:
