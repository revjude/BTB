[[1Pet.2|1 Peter 2:21 - 1 Peter 2:25]]
*Christ’s Example of Suffering*

[[1Pet.2.21|21]] For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:

21: 

[[1Pet.2.22|22]] Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:

22: 

[[1Pet.2.23|23]] Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed \[himself\] to him that judgeth righteously:

23: 

[[1Pet.2.24|24]] Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.

24: 

[[1Pet.2.25|25]] For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

25:
