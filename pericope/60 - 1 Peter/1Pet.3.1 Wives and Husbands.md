[[1Pet.3|1 Peter 3:1 - 1 Peter 3:7]]
*Wives and Husbands*

[[1Pet.3.1|1]] Likewise, ye wives, \[be\] in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;

1: 

[[1Pet.3.2|2]] While they behold your chaste conversation \[coupled\] with fear.

2: 

[[1Pet.3.3|3]] Whose adorning let it not be that outward \[adorning\] of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;

3: 

[[1Pet.3.4|4]] But \[let it be\] the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, \[even the ornament\] of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.

4: 

[[1Pet.3.5|5]] For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:

5: 

[[1Pet.3.6|6]] Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.

6: 

[[1Pet.3.7|7]] Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with \[them\] according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.

7:
