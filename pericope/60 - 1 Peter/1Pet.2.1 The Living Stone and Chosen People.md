[[1Pet.2|1 Peter 2:1 - 1 Peter 2:12]]
*The Living Stone and Chosen People*

[[1Pet.2.1|1]] Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,

1: 

[[1Pet.2.2|2]] As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:

2: 

[[1Pet.2.3|3]] If so be ye have tasted that the Lord \[is\] gracious.

3: 

[[1Pet.2.4|4]] To whom coming, \[as unto\] a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, \[and\] precious,

4: 

[[1Pet.2.5|5]] Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.

5: 

[[1Pet.2.6|6]] Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.

6: 

[[1Pet.2.7|7]] Unto you therefore which believe \[he is\] precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,

7: 

[[1Pet.2.8|8]] And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, \[even to them\] which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.

8: 

[[1Pet.2.9|9]] But ye \[are\] a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:

9: 

[[1Pet.2.10|10]] Which in time past \[were\] not a people, but \[are\] now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.

10: 

[[1Pet.2.11|11]] Dearly beloved, I beseech \[you\] as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;

11: 

[[1Pet.2.12|12]] Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by \[your\] good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.

12:
