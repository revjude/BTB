[[1Pet.2|1 Peter 2:13 - 1 Peter 2:20]]
*Submission to Authorities*

[[1Pet.2.13|13]] Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;

13: 

[[1Pet.2.14|14]] Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.

14: 

[[1Pet.2.15|15]] For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:

15: 

[[1Pet.2.16|16]] As free, and not using \[your\] liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.

16: 

[[1Pet.2.17|17]] Honour all \[men\]. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.

17: 

[[1Pet.2.18|18]] Servants, \[be\] subject to \[your\] masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.

18: 

[[1Pet.2.19|19]] For this \[is\] thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.

19: 

[[1Pet.2.20|20]] For what glory \[is it\], if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer \[for it\], ye take it patiently, this \[is\] acceptable with God.

20:
