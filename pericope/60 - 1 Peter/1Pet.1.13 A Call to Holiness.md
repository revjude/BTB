[[1Pet.1|1 Peter 1:13 - 1 Peter 1:21]]
*A Call to Holiness*

[[1Pet.1.13|13]] Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;

13: 

[[1Pet.1.14|14]] As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:

14: 

[[1Pet.1.15|15]] But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;

15: 

[[1Pet.1.16|16]] Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.

16: 

[[1Pet.1.17|17]] And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning \[here\] in fear:

17: 

[[1Pet.1.18|18]] Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, \[as\] silver and gold, from your vain conversation \[received\] by tradition from your fathers;

18: 

[[1Pet.1.19|19]] But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:

19: 

[[1Pet.1.20|20]] Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,

20: 

[[1Pet.1.21|21]] Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.

21:
