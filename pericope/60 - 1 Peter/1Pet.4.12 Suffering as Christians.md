[[1Pet.4|1 Peter 4:12 - 1 Peter 4:19]]
*Suffering as Christians*

[[1Pet.4.12|12]] Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:

12: 

[[1Pet.4.13|13]] But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.

13: 

[[1Pet.4.14|14]] If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy \[are ye\]; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.

14: 

[[1Pet.4.15|15]] But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or \[as\] a thief, or \[as\] an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters.

15: 

[[1Pet.4.16|16]] Yet if \[any man suffer\] as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.

16: 

[[1Pet.4.17|17]] For the time \[is come\] that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if \[it\] first \[begin\] at us, what shall the end \[be\] of them that obey not the gospel of God?

17: 

[[1Pet.4.18|18]] And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?

18: 

[[1Pet.4.19|19]] Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls \[to him\] in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.

19:
