[[1Pet.5|1 Peter 5:10 - 1 Peter 5:14]]
*Benediction and Farewell*

[[1Pet.5.10|10]] But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle \[you\].

10: 

[[1Pet.5.11|11]] To him \[be\] glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

11: 

[[1Pet.5.12|12]] By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.

12: 

[[1Pet.5.13|13]] The \[church that is\] at Babylon, elected together with \[you\], saluteth you; and \[so doth\] Marcus my son.

13: 

[[1Pet.5.14|14]] Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace \[be\] with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.

14:
