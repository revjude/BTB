[[Rom.15|Romans 15:14 - Romans 15:22]]
*Paul the Minister to the Gentiles*

[[Rom.15.14|14]] And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.

14: 

[[Rom.15.15|15]] Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,

15: 

[[Rom.15.16|16]] That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.

16: 

[[Rom.15.17|17]] I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.

17: 

[[Rom.15.18|18]] For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,

18: 

[[Rom.15.19|19]] Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.

19: 

[[Rom.15.20|20]] Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation:

20: 

[[Rom.15.21|21]] But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.

21: 

[[Rom.15.22|22]] For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.

22:
