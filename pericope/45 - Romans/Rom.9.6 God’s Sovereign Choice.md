[[Rom.9|Romans 9:6 - Romans 9:29]]
*God’s Sovereign Choice*

[[Rom.9.6|6]] Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they \[are\] not all Israel, which are of Israel:

6: 

[[Rom.9.7|7]] Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, \[are they\] all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.

7: 

[[Rom.9.8|8]] That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these \[are\] not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.

8: 

[[Rom.9.9|9]] For this \[is\] the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son.

9: 

[[Rom.9.10|10]] And not only \[this\]; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, \[even\] by our father Isaac;

10: 

[[Rom.9.11|11]] (For \[the children\] being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)

11: 

[[Rom.9.12|12]] It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.

12: 

[[Rom.9.13|13]] As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.

13: 

[[Rom.9.14|14]] What shall we say then? \[Is there\] unrighteousness with God? God forbid.

14: 

[[Rom.9.15|15]] For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.

15: 

[[Rom.9.16|16]] So then \[it is\] not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.

16: 

[[Rom.9.17|17]] For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.

17: 

[[Rom.9.18|18]] Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will \[have mercy\], and whom he will he hardeneth.

18: 

[[Rom.9.19|19]] Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?

19: 

[[Rom.9.20|20]] Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed \[it\], Why hast thou made me thus?

20: 

[[Rom.9.21|21]] Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?

21: 

[[Rom.9.22|22]] \[What\] if God, willing to shew \[his\] wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:

22: 

[[Rom.9.23|23]] And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,

23: 

[[Rom.9.24|24]] Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?

24: 

[[Rom.9.25|25]] As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.

25: 

[[Rom.9.26|26]] And it shall come to pass, \[that\] in the place where it was said unto them, Ye \[are\] not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.

26: 

[[Rom.9.27|27]] Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:

27: 

[[Rom.9.28|28]] For he will finish the work, and cut \[it\] short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.

28: 

[[Rom.9.29|29]] And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.

29:
