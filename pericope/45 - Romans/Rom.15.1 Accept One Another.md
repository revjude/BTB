[[Rom.15|Romans 15:1 - Romans 15:6]]
*Accept One Another*

[[Rom.15.1|1]] We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.

1: 

[[Rom.15.2|2]] Let every one of us please \[his\] neighbour for \[his\] good to edification.

2: 

[[Rom.15.3|3]] For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.

3: 

[[Rom.15.4|4]] For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.

4: 

[[Rom.15.5|5]] Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:

5: 

[[Rom.15.6|6]] That ye may with one mind \[and\] one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

6:
