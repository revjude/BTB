[[Rom.8|Romans 8:18 - Romans 8:27]]
*Future Glory*

[[Rom.8.18|18]] For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time \[are\] not worthy \[to be compared\] with the glory which shall be revealed in us.

18: 

[[Rom.8.19|19]] For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.

19: 

[[Rom.8.20|20]] For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected \[the same\] in hope,

20: 

[[Rom.8.21|21]] Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.

21: 

[[Rom.8.22|22]] For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.

22: 

[[Rom.8.23|23]] And not only \[they\], but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, \[to wit\], the redemption of our body.

23: 

[[Rom.8.24|24]] For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?

24: 

[[Rom.8.25|25]] But if we hope for that we see not, \[then\] do we with patience wait for \[it\].

25: 

[[Rom.8.26|26]] Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.

26: 

[[Rom.8.27|27]] And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what \[is\] the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to \[the will of\] God.

27:
