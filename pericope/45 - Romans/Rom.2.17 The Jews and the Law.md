[[Rom.2|Romans 2:17 - Romans 2:29]]
*The Jews and the Law*

[[Rom.2.17|17]] Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,

17: 

[[Rom.2.18|18]] And knowest \[his\] will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;

18: 

[[Rom.2.19|19]] And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,

19: 

[[Rom.2.20|20]] An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.

20: 

[[Rom.2.21|21]] Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?

21: 

[[Rom.2.22|22]] Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?

22: 

[[Rom.2.23|23]] Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?

23: 

[[Rom.2.24|24]] For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.

24: 

[[Rom.2.25|25]] For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.

25: 

[[Rom.2.26|26]] Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?

26: 

[[Rom.2.27|27]] And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?

27: 

[[Rom.2.28|28]] For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither \[is that\] circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:

28: 

[[Rom.2.29|29]] But he \[is\] a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision \[is that\] of the heart, in the spirit, \[and\] not in the letter; whose praise \[is\] not of men, but of God.

29:
