[[Rom.15|Romans 15:23 - Romans 15:33]]
*Paul’s Travel Plans*

[[Rom.15.23|23]] But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;

23: 

[[Rom.15.24|24]] Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your \[company\].

24: 

[[Rom.15.25|25]] But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.

25: 

[[Rom.15.26|26]] For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.

26: 

[[Rom.15.27|27]] It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.

27: 

[[Rom.15.28|28]] When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.

28: 

[[Rom.15.29|29]] And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.

29: 

[[Rom.15.30|30]] Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in \[your\] prayers to God for me;

30: 

[[Rom.15.31|31]] That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which \[I have\] for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;

31: 

[[Rom.15.32|32]] That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.

32: 

[[Rom.15.33|33]] Now the God of peace \[be\] with you all. Amen.

33:
