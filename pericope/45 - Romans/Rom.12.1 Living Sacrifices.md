[[Rom.12|Romans 12:1 - Romans 12:8]]
*Living Sacrifices*

[[Rom.12.1|1]] I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, \[which is\] your reasonable service.

1: 

[[Rom.12.2|2]] And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what \[is\] that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

2: 

[[Rom.12.3|3]] For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think \[of himself\] more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.

3: 

[[Rom.12.4|4]] For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:

4: 

[[Rom.12.5|5]] So we, \[being\] many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.

5: 

[[Rom.12.6|6]] Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, \[let us prophesy\] according to the proportion of faith;

6: 

[[Rom.12.7|7]] Or ministry, \[let us wait\] on \[our\] ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;

7: 

[[Rom.12.8|8]] Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, \[let him do it\] with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.

8:
