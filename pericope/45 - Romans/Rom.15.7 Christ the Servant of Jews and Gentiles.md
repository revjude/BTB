[[Rom.15|Romans 15:7 - Romans 15:13]]
*Christ the Servant of Jews and Gentiles*

[[Rom.15.7|7]] Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.

7: 

[[Rom.15.8|8]] Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises \[made\] unto the fathers:

8: 

[[Rom.15.9|9]] And that the Gentiles might glorify God for \[his\] mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.

9: 

[[Rom.15.10|10]] And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.

10: 

[[Rom.15.11|11]] And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.

11: 

[[Rom.15.12|12]] And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.

12: 

[[Rom.15.13|13]] Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.

13:
