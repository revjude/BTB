[[Rom.7|Romans 7:13 - Romans 7:25]]
*Struggling with Sin*

[[Rom.7.13|13]] Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.

13: 

[[Rom.7.14|14]] For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.

14: 

[[Rom.7.15|15]] For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.

15: 

[[Rom.7.16|16]] If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that \[it is\] good.

16: 

[[Rom.7.17|17]] Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.

17: 

[[Rom.7.18|18]] For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but \[how\] to perform that which is good I find not.

18: 

[[Rom.7.19|19]] For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.

19: 

[[Rom.7.20|20]] Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.

20: 

[[Rom.7.21|21]] I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.

21: 

[[Rom.7.22|22]] For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:

22: 

[[Rom.7.23|23]] But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.

23: 

[[Rom.7.24|24]] O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?

24: 

[[Rom.7.25|25]] I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.

25:
