[[Rom.12|Romans 12:14 - Romans 12:21]]
*Forgiveness*

[[Rom.12.14|14]] Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.

14: 

[[Rom.12.15|15]] Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.

15: 

[[Rom.12.16|16]] \[Be\] of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.

16: 

[[Rom.12.17|17]] Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.

17: 

[[Rom.12.18|18]] If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.

18: 

[[Rom.12.19|19]] Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but \[rather\] give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance \[is\] mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.

19: 

[[Rom.12.20|20]] Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.

20: 

[[Rom.12.21|21]] Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

21:
