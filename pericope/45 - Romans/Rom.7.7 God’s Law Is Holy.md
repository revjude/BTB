[[Rom.7|Romans 7:7 - Romans 7:12]]
*God’s Law Is Holy*

[[Rom.7.7|7]] What shall we say then? \[Is\] the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.

7: 

[[Rom.7.8|8]] But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin \[was\] dead.

8: 

[[Rom.7.9|9]] For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.

9: 

[[Rom.7.10|10]] And the commandment, which \[was ordained\] to life, I found \[to be\] unto death.

10: 

[[Rom.7.11|11]] For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew \[me\].

11: 

[[Rom.7.12|12]] Wherefore the law \[is\] holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.

12:
