[[Rom.1|Romans 1:18 - Romans 1:32]]
*God’s Wrath against Sin*

[[Rom.1.18|18]] For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;

18: 

[[Rom.1.19|19]] Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed \[it\] unto them.

19: 

[[Rom.1.20|20]] For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, \[even\] his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:

20: 

[[Rom.1.21|21]] Because that, when they knew God, they glorified \[him\] not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.

21: 

[[Rom.1.22|22]] Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,

22: 

[[Rom.1.23|23]] And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.

23: 

[[Rom.1.24|24]] Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:

24: 

[[Rom.1.25|25]] Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.

25: 

[[Rom.1.26|26]] For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:

26: 

[[Rom.1.27|27]] And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.

27: 

[[Rom.1.28|28]] And even as they did not like to retain God in \[their\] knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;

28: 

[[Rom.1.29|29]] Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,

29: 

[[Rom.1.30|30]] Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,

30: 

[[Rom.1.31|31]] Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:

31: 

[[Rom.1.32|32]] Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.

32:
