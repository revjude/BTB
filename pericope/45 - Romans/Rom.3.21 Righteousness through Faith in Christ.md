[[Rom.3|Romans 3:21 - Romans 3:31]]
*Righteousness through Faith in Christ*

[[Rom.3.21|21]] But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;

21: 

[[Rom.3.22|22]] Even the righteousness of God \[which is\] by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:

22: 

[[Rom.3.23|23]] For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

23: 

[[Rom.3.24|24]] Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:

24: 

[[Rom.3.25|25]] Whom God hath set forth \[to be\] a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;

25: 

[[Rom.3.26|26]] To declare, \[I say\], at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.

26: 

[[Rom.3.27|27]] Where \[is\] boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.

27: 

[[Rom.3.28|28]] Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.

28: 

[[Rom.3.29|29]] \[Is he\] the God of the Jews only? \[is he\] not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:

29: 

[[Rom.3.30|30]] Seeing \[it is\] one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.

30: 

[[Rom.3.31|31]] Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.

31:
