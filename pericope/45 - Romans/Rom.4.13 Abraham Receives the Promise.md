[[Rom.4|Romans 4:13 - Romans 4:25]]
*Abraham Receives the Promise*

[[Rom.4.13|13]] For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, \[was\] not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.

13: 

[[Rom.4.14|14]] For if they which are of the law \[be\] heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:

14: 

[[Rom.4.15|15]] Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, \[there is\] no transgression.

15: 

[[Rom.4.16|16]] Therefore \[it is\] of faith, that \[it might be\] by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,

16: 

[[Rom.4.17|17]] (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, \[even\] God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.

17: 

[[Rom.4.18|18]] Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.

18: 

[[Rom.4.19|19]] And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara’s womb:

19: 

[[Rom.4.20|20]] He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;

20: 

[[Rom.4.21|21]] And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.

21: 

[[Rom.4.22|22]] And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.

22: 

[[Rom.4.23|23]] Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;

23: 

[[Rom.4.24|24]] But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;

24: 

[[Rom.4.25|25]] Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.

25:
