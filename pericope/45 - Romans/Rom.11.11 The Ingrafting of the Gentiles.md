[[Rom.11|Romans 11:11 - Romans 11:24]]
*The Ingrafting of the Gentiles*

[[Rom.11.11|11]] I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but \[rather\] through their fall salvation \[is come\] unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.

11: 

[[Rom.11.12|12]] Now if the fall of them \[be\] the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?

12: 

[[Rom.11.13|13]] For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:

13: 

[[Rom.11.14|14]] If by any means I may provoke to emulation \[them which are\] my flesh, and might save some of them.

14: 

[[Rom.11.15|15]] For if the casting away of them \[be\] the reconciling of the world, what \[shall\] the receiving \[of them be\], but life from the dead?

15: 

[[Rom.11.16|16]] For if the firstfruit \[be\] holy, the lump \[is\] also \[holy\]: and if the root \[be\] holy, so \[are\] the branches.

16: 

[[Rom.11.17|17]] And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;

17: 

[[Rom.11.18|18]] Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.

18: 

[[Rom.11.19|19]] Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.

19: 

[[Rom.11.20|20]] Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:

20: 

[[Rom.11.21|21]] For if God spared not the natural branches, \[take heed\] lest he also spare not thee.

21: 

[[Rom.11.22|22]] Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in \[his\] goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.

22: 

[[Rom.11.23|23]] And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.

23: 

[[Rom.11.24|24]] For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural \[branches\], be graffed into their own olive tree?

24:
