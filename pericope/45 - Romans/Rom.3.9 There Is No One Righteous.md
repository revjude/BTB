[[Rom.3|Romans 3:9 - Romans 3:20]]
*There Is No One Righteous*

[[Rom.3.9|9]] What then? are we better \[than they\]? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;

9: 

[[Rom.3.10|10]] As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:

10: 

[[Rom.3.11|11]] There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.

11: 

[[Rom.3.12|12]] They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

12: 

[[Rom.3.13|13]] Their throat \[is\] an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps \[is\] under their lips:

13: 

[[Rom.3.14|14]] Whose mouth \[is\] full of cursing and bitterness:

14: 

[[Rom.3.15|15]] Their feet \[are\] swift to shed blood:

15: 

[[Rom.3.16|16]] Destruction and misery \[are\] in their ways:

16: 

[[Rom.3.17|17]] And the way of peace have they not known:

17: 

[[Rom.3.18|18]] There is no fear of God before their eyes.

18: 

[[Rom.3.19|19]] Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.

19: 

[[Rom.3.20|20]] Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law \[is\] the knowledge of sin.

20:
