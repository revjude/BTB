[[Rom.5|Romans 5:6 - Romans 5:11]]
*Christ’s Sacrifice for the Ungodly*

[[Rom.5.6|6]] For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.

6: 

[[Rom.5.7|7]] For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.

7: 

[[Rom.5.8|8]] But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

8: 

[[Rom.5.9|9]] Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.

9: 

[[Rom.5.10|10]] For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.

10: 

[[Rom.5.11|11]] And not only \[so\], but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.

11:
