[[Rom.13|Romans 13:1 - Romans 13:7]]
*Submission to Authorities*

[[Rom.13.1|1]] Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.

1: 

[[Rom.13.2|2]] Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.

2: 

[[Rom.13.3|3]] For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:

3: 

[[Rom.13.4|4]] For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to \[execute\] wrath upon him that doeth evil.

4: 

[[Rom.13.5|5]] Wherefore \[ye\] must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.

5: 

[[Rom.13.6|6]] For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God’s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.

6: 

[[Rom.13.7|7]] Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute \[is due\]; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.

7:
