[[Rom.6|Romans 6:15 - Romans 6:23]]
*The Wages of Sin*

[[Rom.6.15|15]] What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.

15: 

[[Rom.6.16|16]] Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?

16: 

[[Rom.6.17|17]] But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.

17: 

[[Rom.6.18|18]] Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.

18: 

[[Rom.6.19|19]] I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.

19: 

[[Rom.6.20|20]] For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.

20: 

[[Rom.6.21|21]] What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things \[is\] death.

21: 

[[Rom.6.22|22]] But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.

22: 

[[Rom.6.23|23]] For the wages of sin \[is\] death; but the gift of God \[is\] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

23:
