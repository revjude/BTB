[[Rom.8|Romans 8:28 - Romans 8:34]]
*God Works in All Things*

[[Rom.8.28|28]] And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to \[his\] purpose.

28: 

[[Rom.8.29|29]] For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate \[to be\] conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.

29: 

[[Rom.8.30|30]] Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.

30: 

[[Rom.8.31|31]] What shall we then say to these things? If God \[be\] for us, who \[can be\] against us?

31: 

[[Rom.8.32|32]] He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?

32: 

[[Rom.8.33|33]] Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? \[It is\] God that justifieth.

33: 

[[Rom.8.34|34]] Who \[is\] he that condemneth? \[It is\] Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.

34:
