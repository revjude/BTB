[[Rom.9|Romans 9:1 - Romans 9:5]]
*Paul’s Concern for the Jews*

[[Rom.9.1|1]] I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,

1: 

[[Rom.9.2|2]] That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.

2: 

[[Rom.9.3|3]] For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:

3: 

[[Rom.9.4|4]] Who are Israelites; to whom \[pertaineth\] the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service \[of God\], and the promises;

4: 

[[Rom.9.5|5]] Whose \[are\] the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ \[came\], who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.

5:
