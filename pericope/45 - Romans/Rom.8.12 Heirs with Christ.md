[[Rom.8|Romans 8:12 - Romans 8:17]]
*Heirs with Christ*

[[Rom.8.12|12]] Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.

12: 

[[Rom.8.13|13]] For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.

13: 

[[Rom.8.14|14]] For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.

14: 

[[Rom.8.15|15]] For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.

15: 

[[Rom.8.16|16]] The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:

16: 

[[Rom.8.17|17]] And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with \[him\], that we may be also glorified together.

17:
