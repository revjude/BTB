[[Rom.7|Romans 7:1 - Romans 7:6]]
*Release from the Law*

[[Rom.7.1|1]] Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?

1: 

[[Rom.7.2|2]] For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to \[her\] husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of \[her\] husband.

2: 

[[Rom.7.3|3]] So then if, while \[her\] husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.

3: 

[[Rom.7.4|4]] Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, \[even\] to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.

4: 

[[Rom.7.5|5]] For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.

5: 

[[Rom.7.6|6]] But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not \[in\] the oldness of the letter.

6:
