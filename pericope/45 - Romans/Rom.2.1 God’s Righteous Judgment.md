[[Rom.2|Romans 2:1 - Romans 2:16]]
*God’s Righteous Judgment*

[[Rom.2.1|1]] Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.

1: 

[[Rom.2.2|2]] But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.

2: 

[[Rom.2.3|3]] And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?

3: 

[[Rom.2.4|4]] Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?

4: 

[[Rom.2.5|5]] But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;

5: 

[[Rom.2.6|6]] Who will render to every man according to his deeds:

6: 

[[Rom.2.7|7]] To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:

7: 

[[Rom.2.8|8]] But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,

8: 

[[Rom.2.9|9]] Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;

9: 

[[Rom.2.10|10]] But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:

10: 

[[Rom.2.11|11]] For there is no respect of persons with God.

11: 

[[Rom.2.12|12]] For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;

12: 

[[Rom.2.13|13]] (For not the hearers of the law \[are\] just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.

13: 

[[Rom.2.14|14]] For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:

14: 

[[Rom.2.15|15]] Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and \[their\] thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)

15: 

[[Rom.2.16|16]] In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.

16:
