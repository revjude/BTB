[[Rom.1|Romans 1:8 - Romans 1:17]]
*Unashamed of the Gospel*

[[Rom.1.8|8]] First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.

8: 

[[Rom.1.9|9]] For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;

9: 

[[Rom.1.10|10]] Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.

10: 

[[Rom.1.11|11]] For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;

11: 

[[Rom.1.12|12]] That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.

12: 

[[Rom.1.13|13]] Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.

13: 

[[Rom.1.14|14]] I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.

14: 

[[Rom.1.15|15]] So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.

15: 

[[Rom.1.16|16]] For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

16: 

[[Rom.1.17|17]] For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.

17:
