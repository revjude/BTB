[[Rom.16|Romans 16:17 - Romans 16:20]]
*Avoid Divisions*

[[Rom.16.17|17]] Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.

17: 

[[Rom.16.18|18]] For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.

18: 

[[Rom.16.19|19]] For your obedience is come abroad unto all \[men\]. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.

19: 

[[Rom.16.20|20]] And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ \[be\] with you. Amen.

20:
