[[Rom.14|Romans 14:13 - Romans 14:23]]
*The Law of Love*

[[Rom.14.13|13]] Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in \[his\] brother’s way.

13: 

[[Rom.14.14|14]] I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that \[there is\] nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him \[it is\] unclean.

14: 

[[Rom.14.15|15]] But if thy brother be grieved with \[thy\] meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.

15: 

[[Rom.14.16|16]] Let not then your good be evil spoken of:

16: 

[[Rom.14.17|17]] For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

17: 

[[Rom.14.18|18]] For he that in these things serveth Christ \[is\] acceptable to God, and approved of men.

18: 

[[Rom.14.19|19]] Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.

19: 

[[Rom.14.20|20]] For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed \[are\] pure; but \[it is\] evil for that man who eateth with offence.

20: 

[[Rom.14.21|21]] \[It is\] good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor \[any thing\] whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.

21: 

[[Rom.14.22|22]] Hast thou faith? have \[it\] to thyself before God. Happy \[is\] he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.

22: 

[[Rom.14.23|23]] And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because \[he eateth\] not of faith: for whatsoever \[is\] not of faith is sin.

23:
