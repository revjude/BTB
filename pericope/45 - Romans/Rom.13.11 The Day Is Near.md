[[Rom.13|Romans 13:11 - Romans 13:14]]
*The Day Is Near*

[[Rom.13.11|11]] And that, knowing the time, that now \[it is\] high time to awake out of sleep: for now \[is\] our salvation nearer than when we believed.

11: 

[[Rom.13.12|12]] The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.

12: 

[[Rom.13.13|13]] Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.

13: 

[[Rom.13.14|14]] But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to \[fulfil\] the lusts \[thereof\].

14:
