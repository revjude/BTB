[[Rom.6|Romans 6:1 - Romans 6:14]]
*Dead to Sin, Alive to God*

[[Rom.6.1|1]] What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?

1: 

[[Rom.6.2|2]] God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?

2: 

[[Rom.6.3|3]] Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?

3: 

[[Rom.6.4|4]] Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.

4: 

[[Rom.6.5|5]] For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also \[in the likeness\] of \[his\] resurrection:

5: 

[[Rom.6.6|6]] Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with \[him\], that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.

6: 

[[Rom.6.7|7]] For he that is dead is freed from sin.

7: 

[[Rom.6.8|8]] Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:

8: 

[[Rom.6.9|9]] Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.

9: 

[[Rom.6.10|10]] For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.

10: 

[[Rom.6.11|11]] Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

11: 

[[Rom.6.12|12]] Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.

12: 

[[Rom.6.13|13]] Neither yield ye your members \[as\] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members \[as\] instruments of righteousness unto God.

13: 

[[Rom.6.14|14]] For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.

14:
