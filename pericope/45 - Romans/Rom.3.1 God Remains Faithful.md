[[Rom.3|Romans 3:1 - Romans 3:8]]
*God Remains Faithful*

[[Rom.3.1|1]] What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit \[is there\] of circumcision?

1: 

[[Rom.3.2|2]] Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.

2: 

[[Rom.3.3|3]] For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?

3: 

[[Rom.3.4|4]] God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.

4: 

[[Rom.3.5|5]] But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? \[Is\] God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)

5: 

[[Rom.3.6|6]] God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?

6: 

[[Rom.3.7|7]] For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?

7: 

[[Rom.3.8|8]] And not \[rather\], (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.

8:
