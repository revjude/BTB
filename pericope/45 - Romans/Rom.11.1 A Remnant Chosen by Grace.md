[[Rom.11|Romans 11:1 - Romans 11:10]]
*A Remnant Chosen by Grace*

[[Rom.11.1|1]] I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, \[of\] the tribe of Benjamin.

1: 

[[Rom.11.2|2]] God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,

2: 

[[Rom.11.3|3]] Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.

3: 

[[Rom.11.4|4]] But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to \[the image of\] Baal.

4: 

[[Rom.11.5|5]] Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.

5: 

[[Rom.11.6|6]] And if by grace, then \[is it\] no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if \[it be\] of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.

6: 

[[Rom.11.7|7]] What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded

7: 

[[Rom.11.8|8]] (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.

8: 

[[Rom.11.9|9]] And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:

9: 

[[Rom.11.10|10]] Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.

10:
