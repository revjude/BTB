[[Rom.8|Romans 8:35 - Romans 8:39]]
*More than Conquerors*

[[Rom.8.35|35]] Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? \[shall\] tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?

35: 

[[Rom.8.36|36]] As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

36: 

[[Rom.8.37|37]] Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.

37: 

[[Rom.8.38|38]] For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,

38: 

[[Rom.8.39|39]] Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

39:
