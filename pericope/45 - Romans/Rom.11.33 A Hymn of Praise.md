[[Rom.11|Romans 11:33 - Romans 11:36]]
*A Hymn of Praise*

[[Rom.11.33|33]] O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable \[are\] his judgments, and his ways past finding out!

33: 

[[Rom.11.34|34]] For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counseller?

34: 

[[Rom.11.35|35]] Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?

35: 

[[Rom.11.36|36]] For of him, and through him, and to him, \[are\] all things: to whom \[be\] glory for ever. Amen.

36:
