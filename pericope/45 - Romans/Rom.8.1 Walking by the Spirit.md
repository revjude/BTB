[[Rom.8|Romans 8:1 - Romans 8:11]]
*Walking by the Spirit*

[[Rom.8.1|1]] \[There is\] therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

1: 

[[Rom.8.2|2]] For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.

2: 

[[Rom.8.3|3]] For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:

3: 

[[Rom.8.4|4]] That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

4: 

[[Rom.8.5|5]] For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.

5: 

[[Rom.8.6|6]] For to be carnally minded \[is\] death; but to be spiritually minded \[is\] life and peace.

6: 

[[Rom.8.7|7]] Because the carnal mind \[is\] enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.

7: 

[[Rom.8.8|8]] So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.

8: 

[[Rom.8.9|9]] But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.

9: 

[[Rom.8.10|10]] And if Christ \[be\] in you, the body \[is\] dead because of sin; but the Spirit \[is\] life because of righteousness.

10: 

[[Rom.8.11|11]] But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.

11:
