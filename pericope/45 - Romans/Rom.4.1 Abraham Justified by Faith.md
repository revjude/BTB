[[Rom.4|Romans 4:1 - Romans 4:12]]
*Abraham Justified by Faith*

[[Rom.4.1|1]] What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?

1: 

[[Rom.4.2|2]] For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath \[whereof\] to glory; but not before God.

2: 

[[Rom.4.3|3]] For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.

3: 

[[Rom.4.4|4]] Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.

4: 

[[Rom.4.5|5]] But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.

5: 

[[Rom.4.6|6]] Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,

6: 

[[Rom.4.7|7]] \[Saying\], Blessed \[are\] they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.

7: 

[[Rom.4.8|8]] Blessed \[is\] the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.

8: 

[[Rom.4.9|9]] \[Cometh\] this blessedness then upon the circumcision \[only\], or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.

9: 

[[Rom.4.10|10]] How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.

10: 

[[Rom.4.11|11]] And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which \[he had yet\] being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:

11: 

[[Rom.4.12|12]] And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which \[he had\] being \[yet\] uncircumcised.

12:
