[[Rom.11|Romans 11:25 - Romans 11:32]]
*All Israel Will Be Saved*

[[Rom.11.25|25]] For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.

25: 

[[Rom.11.26|26]] And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:

26: 

[[Rom.11.27|27]] For this \[is\] my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.

27: 

[[Rom.11.28|28]] As concerning the gospel, \[they are\] enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, \[they are\] beloved for the fathers’ sakes.

28: 

[[Rom.11.29|29]] For the gifts and calling of God \[are\] without repentance.

29: 

[[Rom.11.30|30]] For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:

30: 

[[Rom.11.31|31]] Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.

31: 

[[Rom.11.32|32]] For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.

32:
