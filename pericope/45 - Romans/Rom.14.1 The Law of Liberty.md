[[Rom.14|Romans 14:1 - Romans 14:12]]
*The Law of Liberty*

[[Rom.14.1|1]] Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, \[but\] not to doubtful disputations.

1: 

[[Rom.14.2|2]] For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.

2: 

[[Rom.14.3|3]] Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.

3: 

[[Rom.14.4|4]] Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.

4: 

[[Rom.14.5|5]] One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day \[alike\]. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.

5: 

[[Rom.14.6|6]] He that regardeth the day, regardeth \[it\] unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard \[it\]. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.

6: 

[[Rom.14.7|7]] For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.

7: 

[[Rom.14.8|8]] For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.

8: 

[[Rom.14.9|9]] For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.

9: 

[[Rom.14.10|10]] But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.

10: 

[[Rom.14.11|11]] For it is written, \[As\] I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.

11: 

[[Rom.14.12|12]] So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.

12:
