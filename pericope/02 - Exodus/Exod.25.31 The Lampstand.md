*The Lampstand*

[[Exod.25.31|31]] And thou shalt make a candlestick \[of\] pure gold: \[of\] beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.

31: 

[[Exod.25.32|32]] And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side:

32: 

[[Exod.25.33|33]] Three bowls made like unto almonds, \[with\] a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, \[with\] a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick.

33: 

[[Exod.25.34|34]] And in the candlestick \[shall be\] four bowls made like unto almonds, \[with\] their knops and their flowers.

[[Exod.25.35|35]] And \[there shall be\] a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick.

35: 

[[Exod.25.36|36]] Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it \[shall be\] one beaten work \[of\] pure gold.
