[[Exod.31|Exodus 31:12 - Exodus 31:17]]
*The Sign of the Sabbath*

[[Exod.31.12|12]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

12: 

[[Exod.31.13|13]] Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it \[is\] a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that \[ye\] may know that I \[am\] the LORD that doth sanctify you.

13: 

[[Exod.31.14|14]] Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it \[is\] holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth \[any\] work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

14: 

[[Exod.31.15|15]] Six days may work be done; but in the seventh \[is\] the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth \[any\] work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.

15: 

[[Exod.31.16|16]] Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, \[for\] a perpetual covenant.

16: 

[[Exod.31.17|17]] It \[is\] a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for \[in\] six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.

17:
