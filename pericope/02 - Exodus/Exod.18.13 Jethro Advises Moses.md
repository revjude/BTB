[[Exod.18|Exodus 18:13 - Exodus 18:27]]
*Jethro Advises Moses*

[[Exod.18.13|13]] And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.

13: 

[[Exod.18.14|14]] And when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What \[is\] this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?

14: 

[[Exod.18.15|15]] And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of God:

15: 

[[Exod.18.16|16]] When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make \[them\] know the statutes of God, and his laws.

16: 

[[Exod.18.17|17]] And Moses’ father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest \[is\] not good.

17: 

[[Exod.18.18|18]] Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that \[is\] with thee: for this thing \[is\] too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.

18: 

[[Exod.18.19|19]] Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:

19: 

[[Exod.18.20|20]] And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.

20: 

[[Exod.18.21|21]] Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place \[such\] over them, \[to be\] rulers of thousands, \[and\] rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:

21: 

[[Exod.18.22|22]] And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, \[that\] every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear \[the burden\] with thee.

22: 

[[Exod.18.23|23]] If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee \[so\], then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.

23: 

[[Exod.18.24|24]] So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.

24: 

[[Exod.18.25|25]] And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

25: 

[[Exod.18.26|26]] And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.

26: 

[[Exod.18.27|27]] And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.
