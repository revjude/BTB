[[Exod.30|Exodus 30:1 - Exodus 30:10]]
*The Altar of Incense*

[[Exod.30.1|1]] And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: \[of\] shittim wood shalt thou make it.

1: 

[[Exod.30.2|2]] A cubit \[shall be\] the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits \[shall be\] the height thereof: the horns thereof \[shall be\] of the same.

2: 

[[Exod.30.3|3]] And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.

3: 

[[Exod.30.4|4]] And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make \[it\]; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal.

4: 

[[Exod.30.5|5]] And thou shalt make the staves \[of\] shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.

5: 

[[Exod.30.6|6]] And thou shalt put it before the vail that \[is\] by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that \[is\] over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.

6: 

[[Exod.30.7|7]] And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.

7: 

[[Exod.30.8|8]] And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.

8: 

[[Exod.30.9|9]] Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.

9: 

[[Exod.30.10|10]] And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it \[is\] most holy unto the LORD.

10:
