4: 

[[Exod.29.5|5]] And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:

5: 

[[Exod.29.6|6]] And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre.
