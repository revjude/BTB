[[Exod.12|Exodus 12:29 - Exodus 12:30]]
*The Tenth Plague：Death of the Firstborn*

[[Exod.12.29|29]] And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that \[was\] in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.

29: 

[[Exod.12.30|30]] And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for \[there was\] not a house where \[there was\] not one dead.

30:
