[[Exod.29|Exodus 29:38 - Exodus 29:44]]
*The Daily Offerings*

[[Exod.29.38|38]] Now this \[is that\] which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.

38: 

[[Exod.29.39|39]] The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even:

39: 

[[Exod.29.40|40]] And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine \[for\] a drink offering.

40: 

[[Exod.29.41|41]] And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

41: 

[[Exod.29.42|42]] \[This shall be\] a continual burnt offering throughout your generations \[at\] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.

42: 

[[Exod.29.43|43]] And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and \[the tabernacle\] shall be sanctified by my glory.

43: 

[[Exod.29.44|44]] And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest’s office.

44:
