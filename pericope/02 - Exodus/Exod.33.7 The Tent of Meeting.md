[[Exod.33|Exodus 33:7 - Exodus 33:11]]
*The Tent of Meeting*

[[Exod.33.7|7]] And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, \[that\] every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which \[was\] without the camp.

7: 

[[Exod.33.8|8]] And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, \[that\] all the people rose up, and stood every man \[at\] his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.

8: 

[[Exod.33.9|9]] And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood \[at\] the door of the tabernacle, and \[the LORD\] talked with Moses.

9: 

[[Exod.33.10|10]] And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand \[at\] the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man \[in\] his tent door.

10: 

[[Exod.33.11|11]] And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.

11:
