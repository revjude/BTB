[[Exod.19|Exodus 19:16 - Exodus 19:25]]
*The LORD Visits Sinai*

[[Exod.19.16|16]] And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that \[was\] in the camp trembled.

16: 

[[Exod.19.17|17]] And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.

17: 

[[Exod.19.18|18]] And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.

18: 

[[Exod.19.19|19]] And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.

19: 

[[Exod.19.20|20]] And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses \[up\] to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.

20: 

[[Exod.19.21|21]] And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.

21: 

[[Exod.19.22|22]] And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.

22: 

[[Exod.19.23|23]] And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.

23: 

[[Exod.19.24|24]] And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.

24: 

[[Exod.19.25|25]] So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.

25:
