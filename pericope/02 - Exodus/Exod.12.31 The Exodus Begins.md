[[Exod.12|Exodus 12:31 - Exodus 12:42]]
*The Exodus Begins*

[[Exod.12.31|31]] And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, \[and\] get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.

31: 

[[Exod.12.32|32]] Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.

32: 

[[Exod.12.33|33]] And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We \[be\] all dead \[men\].

33: 

[[Exod.12.34|34]] And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.

34: 

[[Exod.12.35|35]] And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:

35: 

[[Exod.12.36|36]] And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them \[such things as they required\]. And they spoiled the Egyptians.

36: 

[[Exod.12.37|37]] And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot \[that were\] men, beside children.

37: 

[[Exod.12.38|38]] And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, \[even\] very much cattle.

38: 

[[Exod.12.39|39]] And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.

39: 

[[Exod.12.40|40]] Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, \[was\] four hundred and thirty years.

40: 

[[Exod.12.41|41]] And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.

41: 

[[Exod.12.42|42]] It \[is\] a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this \[is\] that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.

42:
