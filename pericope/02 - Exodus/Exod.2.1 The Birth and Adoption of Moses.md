[[Exod.2|Exodus 2:1 - Exodus 2:10]]
*The Birth and Adoption of Moses*

[[Exod.2.1|1]] And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took \[to wife\] a daughter of Levi.

1: 

[[Exod.2.2|2]] And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he \[was a\] goodly \[child\], she hid him three months.

2: 

[[Exod.2.3|3]] And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid \[it\] in the flags by the river’s brink.

3: 

[[Exod.2.4|4]] And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.

4: 

[[Exod.2.5|5]] And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash \[herself\] at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river’s side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.

5: 

[[Exod.2.6|6]] And when she had opened \[it\], she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This \[is one\] of the Hebrews’ children.

6: 

[[Exod.2.7|7]] Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?

7: 

[[Exod.2.8|8]] And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child’s mother.

8: 

[[Exod.2.9|9]] And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give \[thee\] thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.

9: 

[[Exod.2.10|10]] And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.

10:
