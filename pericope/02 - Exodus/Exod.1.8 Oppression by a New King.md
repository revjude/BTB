[[Exod.1|Exodus 1:8 - Exodus 1:22]]
*Oppression by a New King*

[[Exod.1.8|8]] Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.

8: 

[[Exod.1.9|9]] And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel \[are\] more and mightier than we:

9: 

[[Exod.1.10|10]] Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and \[so\] get them up out of the land.

10: 

[[Exod.1.11|11]] Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.

11: 

[[Exod.1.12|12]] But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.

12: 

[[Exod.1.13|13]] And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:

13: 

[[Exod.1.14|14]] And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, \[was\] with rigour.

14: 

[[Exod.1.15|15]] And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one \[was\] Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:

15: 

[[Exod.1.16|16]] And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see \[them\] upon the stools; if it \[be\] a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it \[be\] a daughter, then she shall live.

16: 

[[Exod.1.17|17]] But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.

17: 

[[Exod.1.18|18]] And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?

18: 

[[Exod.1.19|19]] And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women \[are\] not as the Egyptian women; for they \[are\] lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.

19: 

[[Exod.1.20|20]] Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.

20: 

[[Exod.1.21|21]] And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.

21: 

[[Exod.1.22|22]] And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

22:
