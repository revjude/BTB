[[Exod.5|Exodus 5:15 - Exodus 5:23]]
*The Cry of the Israelites*

[[Exod.5.15|15]] Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?

15: 

[[Exod.5.16|16]] There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants \[are\] beaten; but the fault \[is\] in thine own people.

16: 

[[Exod.5.17|17]] But he said, Ye \[are\] idle, \[ye are\] idle: therefore ye say, Let us go \[and\] do sacrifice to the LORD.

17: 

[[Exod.5.18|18]] Go therefore now, \[and\] work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.

18: 

[[Exod.5.19|19]] And the officers of the children of Israel did see \[that\] they \[were\] in evil \[case\], after it was said, Ye shall not minish \[ought\] from your bricks of your daily task.

19: 

[[Exod.5.20|20]] And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:

20: 

[[Exod.5.21|21]] And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.

21: 

[[Exod.5.22|22]] And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou \[so\] evil entreated this people? why \[is\] it \[that\] thou hast sent me?

22: 

[[Exod.5.23|23]] For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.

23:
