[[Exod.6|Exodus 6:1 - Exodus 6:13]]
*God Promises Deliverance*

[[Exod.6.1|1]] Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.

1: 

[[Exod.6.2|2]] And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I \[am\] the LORD:

2: 

[[Exod.6.3|3]] And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by \[the name of\] God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.

3: 

[[Exod.6.4|4]] And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.

4: 

[[Exod.6.5|5]] And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.

5: 

[[Exod.6.6|6]] Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I \[am\] the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:

6: 

[[Exod.6.7|7]] And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I \[am\] the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

7: 

[[Exod.6.8|8]] And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I \[am\] the LORD.

8: 

[[Exod.6.9|9]] And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.

9: 

[[Exod.6.10|10]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

10: 

[[Exod.6.11|11]] Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.

11: 

[[Exod.6.12|12]] And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who \[am\] of uncircumcised lips?

12: 

[[Exod.6.13|13]] And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

13:
