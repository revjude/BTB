[[Exod.12|Exodus 12:43 - Exodus 12:51]]
*Instructions for the Passover*

[[Exod.12.43|43]] And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This \[is\] the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:

43: 

[[Exod.12.44|44]] But every man’s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.

44: 

[[Exod.12.45|45]] A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.

45: 

[[Exod.12.46|46]] In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.

46: 

[[Exod.12.47|47]] All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

47: 

[[Exod.12.48|48]] And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.

48: 

[[Exod.12.49|49]] One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.

49: 

[[Exod.12.50|50]] Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

50: 

[[Exod.12.51|51]] And it came to pass the selfsame day, \[that\] the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.

51:
