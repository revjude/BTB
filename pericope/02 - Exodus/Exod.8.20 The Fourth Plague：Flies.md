[[Exod.8|Exodus 8:20 - Exodus 8:32]]
*The Fourth Plague：Flies*

[[Exod.8.20|20]] And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

20: 

[[Exod.8.21|21]] Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms \[of flies\] upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms \[of flies\], and also the ground whereon they \[are\].

21: 

[[Exod.8.22|22]] And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms \[of flies\] shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I \[am\] the LORD in the midst of the earth.

22: 

[[Exod.8.23|23]] And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be.

23: 

[[Exod.8.24|24]] And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm \[of flies\] into the house of Pharaoh, and \[into\] his servants’ houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm \[of flies\].

24: 

[[Exod.8.25|25]] And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.

25: 

[[Exod.8.26|26]] And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?

26: 

[[Exod.8.27|27]] We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.

27: 

[[Exod.8.28|28]] And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for me.

28: 

[[Exod.8.29|29]] And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms \[of flies\] may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.

29: 

[[Exod.8.30|30]] And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.

30: 

[[Exod.8.31|31]] And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms \[of flies\] from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.

31: 

[[Exod.8.32|32]] And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.

32:
