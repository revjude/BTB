[[Exod.26|Exodus 26:7 - Exodus 26:14]]
*The Eleven Curtains of Goat Hair*

[[Exod.26.7|7]] And thou shalt make curtains \[of\] goats’ \[hair\] to be a covering upon the tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make.

7: 

[[Exod.26.8|8]] The length of one curtain \[shall be\] thirty cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and the eleven curtains \[shall be all\] of one measure.

8: 

[[Exod.26.9|9]] And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves, and shalt double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle.

9: 

[[Exod.26.10|10]] And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain \[that is\] outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops in the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.

10: 

[[Exod.26.11|11]] And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, and put the taches into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be one.

11: 

[[Exod.26.12|12]] And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle.

12: 

[[Exod.26.13|13]] And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side of that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent, it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side, to cover it.

13: 

[[Exod.26.14|14]] And thou shalt make a covering for the tent \[of\] rams’ skins dyed red, and a covering above \[of\] badgers’ skins.

14:
