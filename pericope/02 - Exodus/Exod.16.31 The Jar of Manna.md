[[Exod.16|Exodus 16:31 - Exodus 16:36]]
*The Jar of Manna*

[[Exod.16.31|31]] And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it \[was\] like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it \[was\] like wafers \[made\] with honey.

31: 

[[Exod.16.32|32]] And Moses said, This \[is\] the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.

32: 

[[Exod.16.33|33]] And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.

33: 

[[Exod.16.34|34]] As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.

34: 

[[Exod.16.35|35]] And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.

35: 

[[Exod.16.36|36]] Now an omer \[is\] the tenth \[part\] of an ephah.

36:
