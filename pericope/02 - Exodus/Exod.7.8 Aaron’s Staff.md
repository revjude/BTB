[[Exod.7|Exodus 7:8 - Exodus 7:13]]
*Aaron’s Staff*

[[Exod.7.8|8]] And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

8: 

[[Exod.7.9|9]] When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast \[it\] before Pharaoh, \[and\] it shall become a serpent.

9: 

[[Exod.7.10|10]] And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.

10: 

[[Exod.7.11|11]] Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.

11: 

[[Exod.7.12|12]] For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods.

12: 

[[Exod.7.13|13]] And he hardened Pharaoh’s heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.

13:
