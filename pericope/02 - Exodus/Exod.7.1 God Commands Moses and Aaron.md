*God Commands Moses and Aaron*

[[Exod.7.1|1]] And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.

1: 

[[Exod.7.2|2]] Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.

2: 

[[Exod.7.3|3]] And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.

3: 

[[Exod.7.4|4]] But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, \[and\] my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.

4: 

[[Exod.7.5|5]] And the Egyptians shall know that I \[am\] the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.

5: 

[[Exod.7.6|6]] And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.
