[[Exod.37|Exodus 37:10 - Exodus 37:16]]
*The Table of Showbread*

[[Exod.37.10|10]] And he made the table \[of\] shittim wood: two cubits \[was\] the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof:

10: 

[[Exod.37.11|11]] And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of gold round about.

11: 

[[Exod.37.12|12]] Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.

12: 

[[Exod.37.13|13]] And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that \[were\] in the four feet thereof.

13: 

[[Exod.37.14|14]] Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table.

14: 

[[Exod.37.15|15]] And he made the staves \[of\] shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table.

15: 

[[Exod.37.16|16]] And he made the vessels which \[were\] upon the table, his dishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, \[of\] pure gold.

16:
