[[Exod.15|Exodus 15:1 - Exodus 15:21]]
*The Song at the Sea*

[[Exod.15.1|1]] Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

1: 

[[Exod.15.2|2]] The LORD \[is\] my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he \[is\] my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father’s God, and I will exalt him.

2: 

[[Exod.15.3|3]] The LORD \[is\] a man of war: the LORD \[is\] his name.

3: 

[[Exod.15.4|4]] Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.

4: 

[[Exod.15.5|5]] The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.

5: 

[[Exod.15.6|6]] Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.

6: 

[[Exod.15.7|7]] And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, \[which\] consumed them as stubble.

7: 

[[Exod.15.8|8]] And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, \[and\] the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.

8: 

[[Exod.15.9|9]] The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.

9: 

[[Exod.15.10|10]] Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.

10: 

[[Exod.15.11|11]] Who \[is\] like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who \[is\] like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful \[in\] praises, doing wonders?

11: 

[[Exod.15.12|12]] Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.

12: 

[[Exod.15.13|13]] Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people \[which\] thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided \[them\] in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.

13: 

[[Exod.15.14|14]] The people shall hear, \[and\] be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.

14: 

[[Exod.15.15|15]] Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.

15: 

[[Exod.15.16|16]] Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be \[as\] still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, \[which\] thou hast purchased.

16: 

[[Exod.15.17|17]] Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, \[in\] the place, O LORD, \[which\] thou hast made for thee to dwell in, \[in\] the Sanctuary, O Lord, \[which\] thy hands have established.

17: 

[[Exod.15.18|18]] The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.

18: 

[[Exod.15.19|19]] For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry \[land\] in the midst of the sea.

19: 

[[Exod.15.20|20]] And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.

20: 

[[Exod.15.21|21]] And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

21:
