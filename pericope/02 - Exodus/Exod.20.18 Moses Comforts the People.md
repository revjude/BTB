*Moses Comforts the People*

[[Exod.20.18|18]] And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw \[it\], they removed, and stood afar off.

18: 

[[Exod.20.19|19]] And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.

19: 

[[Exod.20.20|20]] And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.

20: 

[[Exod.20.21|21]] And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God \[was\].

21:
