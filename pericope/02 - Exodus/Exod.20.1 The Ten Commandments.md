[[Exod.20|Exodus 20:1 - Exodus 20:17]]
*The Ten Commandments*

[[Exod.20.1|1]] And God spake all these words, saying,

1: 

[[Exod.20.2|2]] I \[am\] the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

2: 

[[Exod.20.3|3]] Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

3: 

[[Exod.20.4|4]] Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness \[of any thing\] that \[is\] in heaven above, or that \[is\] in the earth beneath, or that \[is\] in the water under the earth:

4: 

[[Exod.20.5|5]] Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God \[am\] a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth \[generation\] of them that hate me;

5: 

[[Exod.20.6|6]] And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.

6: 

[[Exod.20.7|7]] Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

7: 

[[Exod.20.8|8]] Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

8: 

[[Exod.20.9|9]] Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

9: 

[[Exod.20.10|10]] But the seventh day \[is\] the sabbath of the LORD thy God: \[in it\] thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that \[is\] within thy gates:

10: 

[[Exod.20.11|11]] For \[in\] six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them \[is\], and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

11: 

[[Exod.20.12|12]] Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

12: 

[[Exod.20.13|13]] Thou shalt not kill.

13: 

[[Exod.20.14|14]] Thou shalt not commit adultery.

14: 

[[Exod.20.15|15]] Thou shalt not steal.

15: 

[[Exod.20.16|16]] Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

16: 

[[Exod.20.17|17]] Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that \[is\] thy neighbour’s.

17:
