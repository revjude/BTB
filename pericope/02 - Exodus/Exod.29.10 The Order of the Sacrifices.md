[[Exod.29|Exodus 29:10 - Exodus 29:30]]
*The Order of the Sacrifices*

[[Exod.29.10|10]] And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock.

10: 

[[Exod.29.11|11]] And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, \[by\] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

11: 

[[Exod.29.12|12]] And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put \[it\] upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar.

12: 

[[Exod.29.13|13]] And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul \[that is\] above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that \[is\] upon them, and burn \[them\] upon the altar.

13: 

[[Exod.29.14|14]] But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it \[is\] a sin offering.

14: 

[[Exod.29.15|15]] Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.

15: 

[[Exod.29.16|16]] And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and sprinkle \[it\] round about upon the altar.

16: 

[[Exod.29.17|17]] And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put \[them\] unto his pieces, and unto his head.

17: 

[[Exod.29.18|18]] And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it \[is\] a burnt offering unto the LORD: it \[is\] a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

18: 

[[Exod.29.19|19]] And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.

19: 

[[Exod.29.20|20]] Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put \[it\] upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.

20: 

[[Exod.29.21|21]] And thou shalt take of the blood that \[is\] upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle \[it\] upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him.

21: 

[[Exod.29.22|22]] Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul \[above\] the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that \[is\] upon them, and the right shoulder; for it \[is\] a ram of consecration:

22: 

[[Exod.29.23|23]] And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that \[is\] before the LORD:

23: 

[[Exod.29.24|24]] And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them \[for\] a wave offering before the LORD.

24: 

[[Exod.29.25|25]] And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn \[them\] upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it \[is\] an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

25: 

[[Exod.29.26|26]] And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron’s consecration, and wave it \[for\] a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be thy part.

26: 

[[Exod.29.27|27]] And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, \[even\] of \[that\] which \[is\] for Aaron, and of \[that\] which is for his sons:

27: 

[[Exod.29.28|28]] And it shall be Aaron’s and his sons’ by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it \[is\] an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, \[even\] their heave offering unto the LORD.

28: 

[[Exod.29.29|29]] And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons’ after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.

29: 

[[Exod.29.30|30]] \[And\] that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy \[place\].

30:
