[[Exod.30|Exodus 30:11 - Exodus 30:16]]
*The Census Offering*

[[Exod.30.11|11]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

11: 

[[Exod.30.12|12]] When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when \[thou\] numberest them.

12: 

[[Exod.30.13|13]] This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel \[is\] twenty gerahs:) an half shekel \[shall be\] the offering of the LORD.

13: 

[[Exod.30.14|14]] Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.

14: 

[[Exod.30.15|15]] The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when \[they\] give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.

15: 

[[Exod.30.16|16]] And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.

16:
