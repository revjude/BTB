[[Exod.36.14|14]] And he made curtains \[of\] goats’ \[hair\] for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.

14: 

[[Exod.36.15|15]] The length of one curtain \[was\] thirty cubits, and four cubits \[was\] the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains \[were\] of one size.

15: 

[[Exod.36.16|16]] And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.

16: 

[[Exod.36.17|17]] And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.

17: 

[[Exod.36.18|18]] And he made fifty taches \[of\] brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.
