[[Exod.37|Exodus 37:25 - Exodus 37:29]]
*The Altar of Incense*

[[Exod.37.25|25]] And he made the incense altar \[of\] shittim wood: the length of it \[was\] a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; \[it was\] foursquare; and two cubits \[was\] the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same.

25: 

[[Exod.37.26|26]] And he overlaid it with pure gold, \[both\] the top of it, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a crown of gold round about.

26: 

[[Exod.37.27|27]] And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to bear it withal.

27: 

[[Exod.37.28|28]] And he made the staves \[of\] shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.
