[[Exod.17|Exodus 17:8 - Exodus 17:16]]
*The Defeat of the Amalekites*

[[Exod.17.8|8]] Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.

8: 

[[Exod.17.9|9]] And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.

9: 

[[Exod.17.10|10]] So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.

10: 

[[Exod.17.11|11]] And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

11: 

[[Exod.17.12|12]] But Moses’ hands \[were\] heavy; and they took a stone, and put \[it\] under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.

12: 

[[Exod.17.13|13]] And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.

13: 

[[Exod.17.14|14]] And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this \[for\] a memorial in a book, and rehearse \[it\] in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.

14: 

[[Exod.17.15|15]] And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:

15: 

[[Exod.17.16|16]] For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn \[that\] the LORD \[will have\] war with Amalek from generation to generation.

16:
