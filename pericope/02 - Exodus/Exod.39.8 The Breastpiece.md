[[Exod.39|Exodus 39:8 - Exodus 39:21]]
*The Breastpiece*

[[Exod.39.8|8]] And he made the breastplate \[of\] cunning work, like the work of the ephod; \[of\] gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

8: 

[[Exod.39.9|9]] It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span \[was\] the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, \[being\] doubled.

9: 

[[Exod.39.10|10]] And they set in it four rows of stones: \[the first\] row \[was\] a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this \[was\] the first row.

10: 

[[Exod.39.11|11]] And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.

11: 

[[Exod.39.12|12]] And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

12: 

[[Exod.39.13|13]] And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: \[they were\] inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.

13: 

[[Exod.39.14|14]] And the stones \[were\] according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, \[like\] the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.

14: 

[[Exod.39.15|15]] And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, \[of\] wreathen work \[of\] pure gold.

15: 

[[Exod.39.16|16]] And they made two ouches \[of\] gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.

16: 

[[Exod.39.17|17]] And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate.

17: 

[[Exod.39.18|18]] And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it.

18: 

[[Exod.39.19|19]] And they made two rings of gold, and put \[them\] on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which \[was\] on the side of the ephod inward.

19: 

[[Exod.39.20|20]] And they made two \[other\] golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the \[other\] coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.

20: 

[[Exod.39.21|21]] And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.

21:
