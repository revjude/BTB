[[Exod.35|Exodus 35:20 - Exodus 35:29]]
*The People Offer Gifts*

[[Exod.35.20|20]] And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.

20: 

[[Exod.35.21|21]] And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, \[and\] they brought the LORD’S offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments.

21: 

[[Exod.35.22|22]] And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, \[and\] brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered \[offered\] an offering of gold unto the LORD.

22: 

[[Exod.35.23|23]] And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’ \[hair\], and red skins of rams, and badgers’ skins, brought \[them\].

23: 

[[Exod.35.24|24]] Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD’S offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought \[it\].

24: 

[[Exod.35.25|25]] And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, \[both\] of blue, and of purple, \[and\] of scarlet, and of fine linen.

25: 

[[Exod.35.26|26]] And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats’ \[hair\].

26: 

[[Exod.35.27|27]] And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate;

27: 

[[Exod.35.28|28]] And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.

28: 

[[Exod.35.29|29]] The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.

29:
