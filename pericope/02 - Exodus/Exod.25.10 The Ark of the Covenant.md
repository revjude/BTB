*The Ark of the Covenant*

[[Exod.25.10|10]] And they shall make an ark \[of\] shittim wood: two cubits and a half \[shall be\] the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.

10: 

[[Exod.25.11|11]] And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about.

11: 

[[Exod.25.12|12]] And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put \[them\] in the four corners thereof; and two rings \[shall be\] in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.

12: 

[[Exod.25.13|13]] And thou shalt make staves \[of\] shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.

13: 

[[Exod.25.14|14]] And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them.
