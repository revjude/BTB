[[Exod.37|Exodus 37:6 - Exodus 37:9]]
*The Mercy Seat*

[[Exod.37.6|6]] And he made the mercy seat \[of\] pure gold: two cubits and a half \[was\] the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof.

6: 

[[Exod.37.7|7]] And he made two cherubims \[of\] gold, beaten out of one piece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat;

7: 

[[Exod.37.8|8]] One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the \[other\] end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof.

8: 

[[Exod.37.9|9]] And the cherubims spread out \[their\] wings on high, \[and\] covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; \[even\] to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims.

9:
