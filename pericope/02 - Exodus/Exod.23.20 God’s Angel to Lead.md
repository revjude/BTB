[[Exod.23|Exodus 23:20 - Exodus 23:33]]
*God’s Angel to Lead*

[[Exod.23.20|20]] Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.

20: 

[[Exod.23.21|21]] Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name \[is\] in him.

21: 

[[Exod.23.22|22]] But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.

22: 

[[Exod.23.23|23]] For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, \[and\] the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.

23: 

[[Exod.23.24|24]] Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.

24: 

[[Exod.23.25|25]] And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.

25: 

[[Exod.23.26|26]] There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.

26: 

[[Exod.23.27|27]] I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.

27: 

[[Exod.23.28|28]] And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.

28: 

[[Exod.23.29|29]] I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.

29: 

[[Exod.23.30|30]] By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.

30: 

[[Exod.23.31|31]] And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.

31: 

[[Exod.23.32|32]] Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

32: 

[[Exod.23.33|33]] They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.

33:
