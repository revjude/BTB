[[Exod.22|Exodus 22:16 - Exodus 22:31]]
*Laws of Social Responsibility*

[[Exod.22.16|16]] And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.

16: 

[[Exod.22.17|17]] If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.

17: 

[[Exod.22.18|18]] Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

18: 

[[Exod.22.19|19]] Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.

19: 

[[Exod.22.20|20]] He that sacrificeth unto \[any\] god, save unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.

20: 

[[Exod.22.21|21]] Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

21: 

[[Exod.22.22|22]] Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.

22: 

[[Exod.22.23|23]] If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;

23: 

[[Exod.22.24|24]] And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.

24: 

[[Exod.22.25|25]] If thou lend money to \[any of\] my people \[that is\] poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.

25: 

[[Exod.22.26|26]] If thou at all take thy neighbour’s raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:

26: 

[[Exod.22.27|27]] For that \[is\] his covering only, it \[is\] his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I \[am\] gracious.

27: 

[[Exod.22.28|28]] Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.

28: 

[[Exod.22.29|29]] Thou shalt not delay \[to offer\] the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.

29: 

[[Exod.22.30|30]] Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, \[and\] with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.

30: 

[[Exod.22.31|31]] And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat \[any\] flesh \[that is\] torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.

31:
