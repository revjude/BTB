[[Exod.25|Exodus 25:17 - Exodus 25:22]]
*The Mercy Seat*

[[Exod.25.17|17]] And thou shalt make a mercy seat \[of\] pure gold: two cubits and a half \[shall be\] the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.

17: 

[[Exod.25.18|18]] And thou shalt make two cherubims \[of\] gold, \[of\] beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.

18: 

[[Exod.25.19|19]] And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: \[even\] of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof.

19: 

[[Exod.25.20|20]] And the cherubims shall stretch forth \[their\] wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces \[shall look\] one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be.

20: 

[[Exod.25.21|21]] And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.

21: 

[[Exod.25.22|22]] And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which \[are\] upon the ark of the testimony, of all \[things\] which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.

22:
