[[Exod.2|Exodus 2:11 - Exodus 2:22]]
*The Rejection and Flight of Moses*

[[Exod.2.11|11]] And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.

11: 

[[Exod.2.12|12]] And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that \[there was\] no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.

12: 

[[Exod.2.13|13]] And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?

13: 

[[Exod.2.14|14]] And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.

14: 

[[Exod.2.15|15]] Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.

15: 

[[Exod.2.16|16]] Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew \[water\], and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.

16: 

[[Exod.2.17|17]] And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.

17: 

[[Exod.2.18|18]] And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How \[is it that\] ye are come so soon to day?

18: 

[[Exod.2.19|19]] And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew \[water\] enough for us, and watered the flock.

19: 

[[Exod.2.20|20]] And he said unto his daughters, And where \[is\] he? why \[is\] it \[that\] ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.

20: 

[[Exod.2.21|21]] And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.

21: 

[[Exod.2.22|22]] And she bare \[him\] a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.

22:
