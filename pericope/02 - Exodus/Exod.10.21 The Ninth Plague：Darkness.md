[[Exod.10|Exodus 10:21 - Exodus 10:29]]
*The Ninth Plague：Darkness*

[[Exod.10.21|21]] And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness \[which\] may be felt.

21: 

[[Exod.10.22|22]] And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:

22: 

[[Exod.10.23|23]] They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.

23: 

[[Exod.10.24|24]] And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.

24: 

[[Exod.10.25|25]] And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.

25: 

[[Exod.10.26|26]] Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.

26: 

[[Exod.10.27|27]] But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go.

27: 

[[Exod.10.28|28]] And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in \[that\] day thou seest my face thou shalt die.

28: 

[[Exod.10.29|29]] And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.

29:
