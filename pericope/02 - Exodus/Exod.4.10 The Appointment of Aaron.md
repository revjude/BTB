[[Exod.4|Exodus 4:10 - Exodus 4:17]]
*The Appointment of Aaron*

[[Exod.4.10|10]] And Moses said unto the LORD, O my Lord, I \[am\] not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I \[am\] slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.

10: 

[[Exod.4.11|11]] And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man’s mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?

11: 

[[Exod.4.12|12]] Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.

12: 

[[Exod.4.13|13]] And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand \[of him whom\] thou wilt send.

13: 

[[Exod.4.14|14]] And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, \[Is\] not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.

14: 

[[Exod.4.15|15]] And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.

15: 

[[Exod.4.16|16]] And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, \[even\] he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.

16: 

[[Exod.4.17|17]] And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.

17:
