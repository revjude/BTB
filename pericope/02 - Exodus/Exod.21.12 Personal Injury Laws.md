[[Exod.21|Exodus 21:12 - Exodus 21:36]]
*Personal Injury Laws*

[[Exod.21.12|12]] He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.

12: 

[[Exod.21.13|13]] And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver \[him\] into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.

13: 

[[Exod.21.14|14]] But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.

14: 

[[Exod.21.15|15]] And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.

15: 

[[Exod.21.16|16]] And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.

16: 

[[Exod.21.17|17]] And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.

17: 

[[Exod.21.18|18]] And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with \[his\] fist, and he die not, but keepeth \[his\] bed:

18: 

[[Exod.21.19|19]] If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote \[him\] be quit: only he shall pay \[for\] the loss of his time, and shall cause \[him\] to be thoroughly healed.

19: 

[[Exod.21.20|20]] And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.

20: 

[[Exod.21.21|21]] Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he \[is\] his money.

21: 

[[Exod.21.22|22]] If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart \[from her\], and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman’s husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges \[determine\].

22: 

[[Exod.21.23|23]] And if \[any\] mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,

23: 

[[Exod.21.24|24]] Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

24: 

[[Exod.21.25|25]] Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

25: 

[[Exod.21.26|26]] And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake.

26: 

[[Exod.21.27|27]] And if he smite out his manservant’s tooth, or his maidservant’s tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake.

27: 

[[Exod.21.28|28]] If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox \[shall be\] quit.

28: 

[[Exod.21.29|29]] But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.

29: 

[[Exod.21.30|30]] If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.

30: 

[[Exod.21.31|31]] Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.

31: 

[[Exod.21.32|32]] If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.

32: 

[[Exod.21.33|33]] And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;

33: 

[[Exod.21.34|34]] The owner of the pit shall make \[it\] good, \[and\] give money unto the owner of them; and the dead \[beast\] shall be his.

34: 

[[Exod.21.35|35]] And if one man’s ox hurt another’s, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead \[ox\] also they shall divide.

35: 

[[Exod.21.36|36]] Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own.
