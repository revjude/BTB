[[Exod.23|Exodus 23:10 - Exodus 23:13]]
*Sabbath Laws*

[[Exod.23.10|10]] And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof:

10: 

[[Exod.23.11|11]] But the seventh \[year\] thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, \[and\] with thy oliveyard.

11: 

[[Exod.23.12|12]] Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.

12: 

[[Exod.23.13|13]] And in all \[things\] that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.

13:
