[[Exod.21|Exodus 21:1 - Exodus 21:11]]
*Hebrew Servants*

[[Exod.21.1|1]] Now these \[are\] the judgments which thou shalt set before them.

1: 

[[Exod.21.2|2]] If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.

2: 

[[Exod.21.3|3]] If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.

3: 

[[Exod.21.4|4]] If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself.

4: 

[[Exod.21.5|5]] And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:

5: 

[[Exod.21.6|6]] Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.

6: 

[[Exod.21.7|7]] And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.

7: 

[[Exod.21.8|8]] If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.

8: 

[[Exod.21.9|9]] And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.

9: 

[[Exod.21.10|10]] If he take him another \[wife\]; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.

10: 

[[Exod.21.11|11]] And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money.

11:
