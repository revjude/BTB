[[Exod.12|Exodus 12:14 - Exodus 12:28]]
*The Feast of Unleavened Bread*

[[Exod.12.14|14]] And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.

14: 

[[Exod.12.15|15]] Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.

15: 

[[Exod.12.16|16]] And in the first day \[there shall be\] an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save \[that\] which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.

16: 

[[Exod.12.17|17]] And ye shall observe \[the feast of\] unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.

17: 

[[Exod.12.18|18]] In the first \[month\], on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.

18: 

[[Exod.12.19|19]] Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.

19: 

[[Exod.12.20|20]] Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.

20: 

[[Exod.12.21|21]] Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.

21: 

[[Exod.12.22|22]] And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip \[it\] in the blood that \[is\] in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that \[is\] in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.

22: 

[[Exod.12.23|23]] For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite \[you\].

23: 

[[Exod.12.24|24]] And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.

24: 

[[Exod.12.25|25]] And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.

25: 

[[Exod.12.26|26]] And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?

26: 

[[Exod.12.27|27]] That ye shall say, It \[is\] the sacrifice of the LORD’S passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.

27: 

[[Exod.12.28|28]] And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

28:
