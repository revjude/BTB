[[Exod.4|Exodus 4:6 - Exodus 4:9]]
*Moses’ Hand*

[[Exod.4.6|6]] And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand \[was\] leprous as snow.

6: 

[[Exod.4.7|7]] And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his \[other\] flesh.

7: 

[[Exod.4.8|8]] And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.

8: 

[[Exod.4.9|9]] And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour \[it\] upon the dry \[land\]: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry \[land\].

9:
