[[Exod.30|Exodus 30:17 - Exodus 30:21]]
*The Bronze Basin*

[[Exod.30.17|17]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

17: 

[[Exod.30.18|18]] Thou shalt also make a laver \[of\] brass, and his foot \[also of\] brass, to wash \[withal\]: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.

18: 

[[Exod.30.19|19]] For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:

19: 

[[Exod.30.20|20]] When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:

20: 

[[Exod.30.21|21]] So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, \[even\] to him and to his seed throughout their generations.

21:
