22: 

[[Exod.38.23|23]] And with him \[was\] Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.

23: 

[[Exod.38.24|24]] All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy \[place\], even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary.

24: 

[[Exod.38.25|25]] And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation \[was\] an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:

25: 

[[Exod.38.26|26]] A bekah for every man, \[that is\], half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty \[men\].

26: 

[[Exod.38.27|27]] And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.

27: 

[[Exod.38.28|28]] And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five \[shekels\] he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted them.

28: 

[[Exod.38.29|29]] And the brass of the offering \[was\] seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels.
