[[Exod.33|Exodus 33:12 - Exodus 33:23]]
*The Promise of God’s Presence*

[[Exod.33.12|12]] And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.

12: 

[[Exod.33.13|13]] Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation \[is\] thy people.

13: 

[[Exod.33.14|14]] And he said, My presence shall go \[with thee\], and I will give thee rest.

14: 

[[Exod.33.15|15]] And he said unto him, If thy presence go not \[with me\], carry us not up hence.

15: 

[[Exod.33.16|16]] For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? \[is it\] not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that \[are\] upon the face of the earth.

16: 

[[Exod.33.17|17]] And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.

17: 

[[Exod.33.18|18]] And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.

18: 

[[Exod.33.19|19]] And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.

19: 

[[Exod.33.20|20]] And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.

20: 

[[Exod.33.21|21]] And the LORD said, Behold, \[there is\] a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:

21: 

[[Exod.33.22|22]] And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:

22: 

[[Exod.33.23|23]] And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.

23:
