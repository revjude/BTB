[[Exod.16|Exodus 16:22 - Exodus 16:30]]
*The Sabbath Observed*

[[Exod.16.22|22]] And it came to pass, \[that\] on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one \[man\]: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.

22: 

[[Exod.16.23|23]] And he said unto them, This \[is that\] which the LORD hath said, To morrow \[is\] the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake \[that\] which ye will bake \[to day\], and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.

23: 

[[Exod.16.24|24]] And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.

24: 

[[Exod.16.25|25]] And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day \[is\] a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.

25: 

[[Exod.16.26|26]] Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, \[which is\] the sabbath, in it there shall be none.

26: 

[[Exod.16.27|27]] And it came to pass, \[that\] there went out \[some\] of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.

27: 

[[Exod.16.28|28]] And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?

28: 

[[Exod.16.29|29]] See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.

29: 

[[Exod.16.30|30]] So the people rested on the seventh day.

30:
