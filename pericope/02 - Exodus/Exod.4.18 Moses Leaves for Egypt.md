[[Exod.4|Exodus 4:18 - Exodus 4:26]]
*Moses Leaves for Egypt*

[[Exod.4.18|18]] And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which \[are\] in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.

18: 

[[Exod.4.19|19]] And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.

19: 

[[Exod.4.20|20]] And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.

20: 

[[Exod.4.21|21]] And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.

21: 

[[Exod.4.22|22]] And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel \[is\] my son, \[even\] my firstborn:

22: 

[[Exod.4.23|23]] And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, \[even\] thy firstborn.

23: 

[[Exod.4.24|24]] And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.

24: 

[[Exod.4.25|25]] Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast \[it\] at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband \[art\] thou to me.

25: 

[[Exod.4.26|26]] So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband \[thou art\], because of the circumcision.

26:
