*Bezalel and Oholiab*

[[Exod.31.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

1: 

[[Exod.31.2|2]] See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:

2: 

[[Exod.31.3|3]] And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,

3: 

[[Exod.31.4|4]] To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,

4: 

[[Exod.31.5|5]] And in cutting of stones, to set \[them\], and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.

5: 

[[Exod.31.6|6]] And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee;

6: 

[[Exod.31.7|7]] The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that \[is\] thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,

7: 

[[Exod.31.8|8]] And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,

8: 

[[Exod.31.9|9]] And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot,

9: 

[[Exod.31.10|10]] And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest’s office,

10: 

[[Exod.31.11|11]] And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy \[place\]: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.

11:
