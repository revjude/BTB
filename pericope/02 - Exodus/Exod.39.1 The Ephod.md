1: 

[[Exod.39.2|2]] And he made the ephod \[of\] gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

2: 

[[Exod.39.3|3]] And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut \[it into\] wires, to work \[it\] in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, \[with\] cunning work.

[[Exod.39.5|5]] And the curious girdle of his ephod, that \[was\] upon it, \[was\] of the same, according to the work thereof; \[of\] gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.

5: 

[[Exod.39.6|6]] And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.

6: 

[[Exod.39.7|7]] And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, \[that they should be\] stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.

7:
