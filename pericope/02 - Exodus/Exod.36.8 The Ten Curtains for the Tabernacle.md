[[Exod.36|Exodus 36:8 - Exodus 36:13]]
*The Ten Curtains for the Tabernacle*

[[Exod.36.8|8]] And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains \[of\] fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: \[with\] cherubims of cunning work made he them.

8: 

[[Exod.36.9|9]] The length of one curtain \[was\] twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains \[were\] all of one size.

9: 

[[Exod.36.10|10]] And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and \[the other\] five curtains he coupled one unto another.

10: 

[[Exod.36.11|11]] And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of \[another\] curtain, in the coupling of the second.

11: 

[[Exod.36.12|12]] Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which \[was\] in the coupling of the second: the loops held one \[curtain\] to another.

12: 

[[Exod.36.13|13]] And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.

13:
