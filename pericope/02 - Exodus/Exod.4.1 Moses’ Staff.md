[[Exod.4|Exodus 4:1 - Exodus 4:5]]
*Moses’ Staff*

[[Exod.4.1|1]] And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.

1: 

[[Exod.4.2|2]] And the LORD said unto him, What \[is\] that in thine hand? And he said, A rod.

2: 

[[Exod.4.3|3]] And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.

3: 

[[Exod.4.4|4]] And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:

4: 

[[Exod.4.5|5]] That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.

5:
