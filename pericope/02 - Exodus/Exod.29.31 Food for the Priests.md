[[Exod.29|Exodus 29:31 - Exodus 29:37]]
*Food for the Priests*

[[Exod.29.31|31]] And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place.

31: 

[[Exod.29.32|32]] And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that \[is\] in the basket, \[by\] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

32: 

[[Exod.29.33|33]] And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate \[and\] to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat \[thereof\], because they \[are\] holy.

33: 

[[Exod.29.34|34]] And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it \[is\] holy.

34: 

[[Exod.29.35|35]] And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all \[things\] which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them.

35: 

[[Exod.29.36|36]] And thou shalt offer every day a bullock \[for\] a sin offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.

36: 

[[Exod.29.37|37]] Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.

37:
