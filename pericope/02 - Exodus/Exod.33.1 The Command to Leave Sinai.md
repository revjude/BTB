[[Exod.33|Exodus 33:1 - Exodus 33:6]]
*The Command to Leave Sinai*

[[Exod.33.1|1]] And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, \[and\] go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:

1: 

[[Exod.33.2|2]] And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:

2: 

[[Exod.33.3|3]] Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou \[art\] a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.

3: 

[[Exod.33.4|4]] And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.

4: 

[[Exod.33.5|5]] For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye \[are\] a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.

5: 

[[Exod.33.6|6]] And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.

6:
