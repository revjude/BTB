[[Exod.36|Exodus 36:20 - Exodus 36:34]]
*The Frames and Bases*

[[Exod.36.20|20]] And he made boards for the tabernacle \[of\] shittim wood, standing up.

20: 

[[Exod.36.21|21]] The length of a board \[was\] ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half.

21: 

[[Exod.36.22|22]] One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.

22: 

[[Exod.36.23|23]] And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward:

23: 

[[Exod.36.24|24]] And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.

24: 

[[Exod.36.25|25]] And for the other side of the tabernacle, \[which is\] toward the north corner, he made twenty boards,

25: 

[[Exod.36.26|26]] And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.

26: 

[[Exod.36.27|27]] And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.

27: 

[[Exod.36.28|28]] And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.

28: 

[[Exod.36.29|29]] And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.

29: 

[[Exod.36.30|30]] And there were eight boards; and their sockets \[were\] sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.

30: 

[[Exod.36.31|31]] And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,

31: 

[[Exod.36.32|32]] And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward.

32: 

[[Exod.36.33|33]] And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other.

33: 

[[Exod.36.34|34]] And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings \[of\] gold \[to be\] places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.

34:
