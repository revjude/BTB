[[Exod.28|Exodus 28:6 - Exodus 28:14]]
*The Ephod*

[[Exod.28.6|6]] And they shall make the ephod \[of\] gold, \[of\] blue, and \[of\] purple, \[of\] scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.

6: 

[[Exod.28.7|7]] It shall have the two shoulderpieces thereof joined at the two edges thereof; and \[so\] it shall be joined together.

7: 

[[Exod.28.8|8]] And the curious girdle of the ephod, which \[is\] upon it, shall be of the same, according to the work thereof; \[even of\] gold, \[of\] blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

8: 

[[Exod.28.9|9]] And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the children of Israel:

9: 

[[Exod.28.10|10]] Six of their names on one stone, and \[the other\] six names of the rest on the other stone, according to their birth.

10: 

[[Exod.28.11|11]] With the work of an engraver in stone, \[like\] the engravings of a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones with the names of the children of Israel: thou shalt make them to be set in ouches of gold.

11: 

[[Exod.28.12|12]] And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the ephod \[for\] stones of memorial unto the children of Israel: and Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD upon his two shoulders for a memorial.

12: 

[[Exod.28.13|13]] And thou shalt make ouches \[of\] gold;

13: 

[[Exod.28.14|14]] And two chains \[of\] pure gold at the ends; \[of\] wreathen work shalt thou make them, and fasten the wreathen chains to the ouches.

14:
