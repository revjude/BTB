[[Exod.23|Exodus 23:1 - Exodus 23:9]]
*Justice and Mercy*

[[Exod.23.1|1]] Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.

1: 

[[Exod.23.2|2]] Thou shalt not follow a multitude to \[do\] evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest \[judgment\]:

2: 

[[Exod.23.3|3]] Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.

3: 

[[Exod.23.4|4]] If thou meet thine enemy’s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.

4: 

[[Exod.23.5|5]] If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.

5: 

[[Exod.23.6|6]] Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.

6: 

[[Exod.23.7|7]] Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.

7: 

[[Exod.23.8|8]] And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.

8: 

[[Exod.23.9|9]] Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

9:
