[[Exod.26|Exodus 26:31 - Exodus 26:35]]
*The Veil*

[[Exod.26.31|31]] And thou shalt make a vail \[of\] blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubims shall it be made:

31: 

[[Exod.26.32|32]] And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim \[wood\] overlaid with gold: their hooks \[shall be of\] gold, upon the four sockets of silver.

32: 

[[Exod.26.33|33]] And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches, that thou mayest bring in thither within the vail the ark of the testimony: and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy \[place\] and the most holy.

33: 

[[Exod.26.34|34]] And thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark of the testimony in the most holy \[place\].

34: 

[[Exod.26.35|35]] And thou shalt set the table without the vail, and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south: and thou shalt put the table on the north side.

35:
