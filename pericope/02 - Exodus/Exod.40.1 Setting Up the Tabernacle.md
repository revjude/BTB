[[Exod.40|Exodus 40:1 - Exodus 40:33]]
*Setting Up the Tabernacle*

[[Exod.40.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

1: 

[[Exod.40.2|2]] On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

2: 

[[Exod.40.3|3]] And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail.

3: 

[[Exod.40.4|4]] And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.

4: 

[[Exod.40.5|5]] And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.

5: 

[[Exod.40.6|6]] And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

6: 

[[Exod.40.7|7]] And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.

7: 

[[Exod.40.8|8]] And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.

8: 

[[Exod.40.9|9]] And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that \[is\] therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.

9: 

[[Exod.40.10|10]] And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.

10: 

[[Exod.40.11|11]] And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.

11: 

[[Exod.40.12|12]] And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.

12: 

[[Exod.40.13|13]] And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest’s office.

13: 

[[Exod.40.14|14]] And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:

14: 

[[Exod.40.15|15]] And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.

15: 

[[Exod.40.16|16]] Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.

16: 

[[Exod.40.17|17]] And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first \[day\] of the month, \[that\] the tabernacle was reared up.

17: 

[[Exod.40.18|18]] And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.

18: 

[[Exod.40.19|19]] And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.

19: 

[[Exod.40.20|20]] And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:

20: 

[[Exod.40.21|21]] And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.

21: 

[[Exod.40.22|22]] And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.

22: 

[[Exod.40.23|23]] And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.

23: 

[[Exod.40.24|24]] And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.

24: 

[[Exod.40.25|25]] And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.

25: 

[[Exod.40.26|26]] And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:

26: 

[[Exod.40.27|27]] And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.

27: 

[[Exod.40.28|28]] And he set up the hanging \[at\] the door of the tabernacle.

28: 

[[Exod.40.29|29]] And he put the altar of burnt offering \[by\] the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.

29: 

[[Exod.40.30|30]] And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash \[withal\].

30: 

[[Exod.40.31|31]] And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:

31: 

[[Exod.40.32|32]] When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.

32: 

[[Exod.40.33|33]] And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.

33:
