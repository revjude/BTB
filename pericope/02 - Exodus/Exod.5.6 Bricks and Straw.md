[[Exod.5|Exodus 5:6 - Exodus 5:14]]
*Bricks and Straw*

[[Exod.5.6|6]] And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,

6: 

[[Exod.5.7|7]] Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.

7: 

[[Exod.5.8|8]] And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish \[ought\] thereof: for they \[be\] idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go \[and\] sacrifice to our God.

8: 

[[Exod.5.9|9]] Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.

9: 

[[Exod.5.10|10]] And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.

10: 

[[Exod.5.11|11]] Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.

11: 

[[Exod.5.12|12]] So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.

12: 

[[Exod.5.13|13]] And the taskmasters hasted \[them\], saying, Fulfil your works, \[your\] daily tasks, as when there was straw.

13: 

[[Exod.5.14|14]] And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, \[and\] demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?

14:
