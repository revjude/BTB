[[Exod.28|Exodus 28:15 - Exodus 28:30]]
*The Breastpiece*

[[Exod.28.15|15]] And thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work; after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; \[of\] gold, \[of\] blue, and \[of\] purple, and \[of\] scarlet, and \[of\] fine twined linen, shalt thou make it.

15: 

[[Exod.28.16|16]] Foursquare it shall be \[being\] doubled; a span \[shall be\] the length thereof, and a span \[shall be\] the breadth thereof.

16: 

[[Exod.28.17|17]] And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, \[even\] four rows of stones: \[the first\] row \[shall be\] a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: \[this shall be\] the first row.

17: 

[[Exod.28.18|18]] And the second row \[shall be\] an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.

18: 

[[Exod.28.19|19]] And the third row a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

19: 

[[Exod.28.20|20]] And the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they shall be set in gold in their inclosings.

20: 

[[Exod.28.21|21]] And the stones shall be with the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, \[like\] the engravings of a signet; every one with his name shall they be according to the twelve tribes.

21: 

[[Exod.28.22|22]] And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains at the ends \[of\] wreathen work \[of\] pure gold.

22: 

[[Exod.28.23|23]] And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.

23: 

[[Exod.28.24|24]] And thou shalt put the two wreathen \[chains\] of gold in the two rings \[which are\] on the ends of the breastplate.

24: 

[[Exod.28.25|25]] And \[the other\] two ends of the two wreathen \[chains\] thou shalt fasten in the two ouches, and put \[them\] on the shoulderpieces of the ephod before it.

25: 

[[Exod.28.26|26]] And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof, which \[is\] in the side of the ephod inward.

26: 

[[Exod.28.27|27]] And two \[other\] rings of gold thou shalt make, and shalt put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart thereof, over against the \[other\] coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.

27: 

[[Exod.28.28|28]] And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that \[it\] may be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate be not loosed from the ephod.

28: 

[[Exod.28.29|29]] And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy \[place\], for a memorial before the LORD continually.

29: 

[[Exod.28.30|30]] And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron’s heart, when he goeth in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the LORD continually.

30:
