[[Exod.13|Exodus 13:17 - Exodus 13:22]]
*The Pillars of Cloud and Fire*

[[Exod.13.17|17]] And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not \[through\] the way of the land of the Philistines, although that \[was\] near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:

17: 

[[Exod.13.18|18]] But God led the people about, \[through\] the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.

18: 

[[Exod.13.19|19]] And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.

19: 

[[Exod.13.20|20]] And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.

20: 

[[Exod.13.21|21]] And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:

21: 

[[Exod.13.22|22]] He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, \[from\] before the people.

22:
