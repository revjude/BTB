[[Exod.18|Exodus 18:1 - Exodus 18:12]]
*The Visit of Jethro*

[[Exod.18.1|1]] When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, \[and\] that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;

1: 

[[Exod.18.2|2]] Then Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her back,

2: 

[[Exod.18.3|3]] And her two sons; of which the name of the one \[was\] Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:

3: 

[[Exod.18.4|4]] And the name of the other \[was\] Eliezer; for the God of my father, \[said he, was\] mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:

4: 

[[Exod.18.5|5]] And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:

5: 

[[Exod.18.6|6]] And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.

6: 

[[Exod.18.7|7]] And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of \[their\] welfare; and they came into the tent.

7: 

[[Exod.18.8|8]] And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, \[and\] all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and \[how\] the LORD delivered them.

8: 

[[Exod.18.9|9]] And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.

9: 

[[Exod.18.10|10]] And Jethro said, Blessed \[be\] the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.

10: 

[[Exod.18.11|11]] Now I know that the LORD \[is\] greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly \[he was\] above them.

11: 

[[Exod.18.12|12]] And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father in law before God.

12:
