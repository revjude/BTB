*Bezalel and Oholiab*

[[Exod.35.30|30]] And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;

30: 

[[Exod.35.31|31]] And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;

31: 

[[Exod.35.32|32]] And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,

32: 

[[Exod.35.33|33]] And in the cutting of stones, to set \[them\], and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.

33: 

[[Exod.35.34|34]] And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, \[both\] he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.

34: 

[[Exod.35.35|35]] Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, \[even\] of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work.
