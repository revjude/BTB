[[Exod.12|Exodus 12:1 - Exodus 12:13]]
*The First Passover*

[[Exod.12.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,

1: 

[[Exod.12.2|2]] This month \[shall be\] unto you the beginning of months: it \[shall be\] the first month of the year to you.

2: 

[[Exod.12.3|3]] Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth \[day\] of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of \[their\] fathers, a lamb for an house:

3: 

[[Exod.12.4|4]] And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take \[it\] according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.

4: 

[[Exod.12.5|5]] Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take \[it\] out from the sheep, or from the goats:

5: 

[[Exod.12.6|6]] And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.

6: 

[[Exod.12.7|7]] And they shall take of the blood, and strike \[it\] on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.

7: 

[[Exod.12.8|8]] And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; \[and\] with bitter \[herbs\] they shall eat it.

8: 

[[Exod.12.9|9]] Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast \[with\] fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.

9: 

[[Exod.12.10|10]] And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.

10: 

[[Exod.12.11|11]] And thus shall ye eat it; \[with\] your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it \[is\] the LORD’S passover.

11: 

[[Exod.12.12|12]] For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I \[am\] the LORD.

12: 

[[Exod.12.13|13]] And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye \[are\]: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy \[you\], when I smite the land of Egypt.

13:
