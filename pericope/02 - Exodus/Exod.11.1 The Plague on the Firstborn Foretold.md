[[Exod.11|Exodus 11:1 - Exodus 11:10]]
*The Plague on the Firstborn Foretold*

[[Exod.11.1|1]] And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague \[more\] upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let \[you\] go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.

1: 

[[Exod.11.2|2]] Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.

2: 

[[Exod.11.3|3]] And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses \[was\] very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants, and in the sight of the people.

3: 

[[Exod.11.4|4]] And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:

4: 

[[Exod.11.5|5]] And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that \[is\] behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.

5: 

[[Exod.11.6|6]] And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.

6: 

[[Exod.11.7|7]] But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.

7: 

[[Exod.11.8|8]] And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.

8: 

[[Exod.11.9|9]] And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.

9: 

[[Exod.11.10|10]] And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.

10:
