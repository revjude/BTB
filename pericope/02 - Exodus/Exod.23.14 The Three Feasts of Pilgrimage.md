[[Exod.23|Exodus 23:14 - Exodus 23:19]]
*The Three Feasts of Pilgrimage*

[[Exod.23.14|14]] Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.

14: 

[[Exod.23.15|15]] Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)

15: 

[[Exod.23.16|16]] And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, \[which is\] in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.

16: 

[[Exod.23.17|17]] Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD.

17: 

[[Exod.23.18|18]] Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.

18: 

[[Exod.23.19|19]] The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother’s milk.

19:
