[[Exod.20|Exodus 20:22 - Exodus 20:26]]
*Idolatry Forbidden*

[[Exod.20.22|22]] And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.

22: 

[[Exod.20.23|23]] Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.

23: 

[[Exod.20.24|24]] An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.

24: 

[[Exod.20.25|25]] And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.

25: 

[[Exod.20.26|26]] Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.

26:
