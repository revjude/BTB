[[Exod.40|Exodus 40:34 - Exodus 40:38]]
*The Cloud and the Glory*

[[Exod.40.34|34]] Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

34: 

[[Exod.40.35|35]] And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

35: 

[[Exod.40.36|36]] And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:

36: 

[[Exod.40.37|37]] But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.

37: 

[[Exod.40.38|38]] For the cloud of the LORD \[was\] upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.

38:
