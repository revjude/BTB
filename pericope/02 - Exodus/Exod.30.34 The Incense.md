[[Exod.30|Exodus 30:34 - Exodus 30:38]]
*The Incense*

[[Exod.30.34|34]] And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; \[these\] sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like \[weight\]:

34: 

[[Exod.30.35|35]] And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure \[and\] holy:

35: 

[[Exod.30.36|36]] And thou shalt beat \[some\] of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.

36: 

[[Exod.30.37|37]] And \[as for\] the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD.

37: 

[[Exod.30.38|38]] Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.

38:
