*The Frames and Bases*

[[Exod.26.15|15]] And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle \[of\] shittim wood standing up.

15: 

[[Exod.26.16|16]] Ten cubits \[shall be\] the length of a board, and a cubit and a half \[shall be\] the breadth of one board.

16: 

[[Exod.26.17|17]] Two tenons \[shall there be\] in one board, set in order one against another: thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle.

17: 

[[Exod.26.18|18]] And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards on the south side southward.

18: 

[[Exod.26.19|19]] And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.

19: 

[[Exod.26.20|20]] And for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side \[there shall be\] twenty boards:

20: 

[[Exod.26.21|21]] And their forty sockets \[of\] silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.

21: 

[[Exod.26.22|22]] And for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make six boards.

22: 

[[Exod.26.23|23]] And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.

23: 

[[Exod.26.24|24]] And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be coupled together above the head of it unto one ring: thus shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners.

24: 

[[Exod.26.25|25]] And they shall be eight boards, and their sockets \[of\] silver, sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.

25: 

[[Exod.26.26|26]] And thou shalt make bars \[of\] shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,

26:

[[Exod.26.28|28]] And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end to end.

28: 

[[Exod.26.29|29]] And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings \[of\] gold \[for\] places for the bars: and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold.
