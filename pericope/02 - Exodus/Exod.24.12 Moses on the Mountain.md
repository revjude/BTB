[[Exod.24|Exodus 24:12 - Exodus 24:18]]
*Moses on the Mountain*

[[Exod.24.12|12]] And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.

12: 

[[Exod.24.13|13]] And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.

13: 

[[Exod.24.14|14]] And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur \[are\] with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.

14: 

[[Exod.24.15|15]] And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.

15: 

[[Exod.24.16|16]] And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.

16: 

[[Exod.24.17|17]] And the sight of the glory of the LORD \[was\] like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.

17: 

[[Exod.24.18|18]] And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.

18:
