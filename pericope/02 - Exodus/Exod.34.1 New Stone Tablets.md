[[Exod.34|Exodus 34:1 - Exodus 34:9]]
*New Stone Tablets*

[[Exod.34.1|1]] And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon \[these\] tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.

1: 

[[Exod.34.2|2]] And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.

2: 

[[Exod.34.3|3]] And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.

3: 

[[Exod.34.4|4]] And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.

4: 

[[Exod.34.5|5]] And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.

5: 

[[Exod.34.6|6]] And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,

6: 

[[Exod.34.7|7]] Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear \[the guilty\]; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, unto the third and to the fourth \[generation\].

7: 

[[Exod.34.8|8]] And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.

8: 

[[Exod.34.9|9]] And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it \[is\] a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.

9:
