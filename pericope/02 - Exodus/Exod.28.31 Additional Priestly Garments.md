[[Exod.28|Exodus 28:31 - Exodus 28:43]]
*Additional Priestly Garments*

[[Exod.28.31|31]] And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all \[of\] blue.

31: 

[[Exod.28.32|32]] And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the midst thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it were the hole of an habergeon, that it be not rent.

32: 

[[Exod.28.33|33]] And \[beneath\] upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates \[of\] blue, and \[of\] purple, and \[of\] scarlet, round about the hem thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:

33: 

[[Exod.28.34|34]] A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe round about.

34: 

[[Exod.28.35|35]] And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy \[place\] before the LORD, and when he cometh out, that he die not.

35: 

[[Exod.28.36|36]] And thou shalt make a plate \[of\] pure gold, and grave upon it, \[like\] the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.

36: 

[[Exod.28.37|37]] And thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be.

37: 

[[Exod.28.38|38]] And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.

38: 

[[Exod.28.39|39]] And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen, and thou shalt make the mitre \[of\] fine linen, and thou shalt make the girdle \[of\] needlework.

39: 

[[Exod.28.40|40]] And for Aaron’s sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them, for glory and for beauty.

40: 

[[Exod.28.41|41]] And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office.

41: 

[[Exod.28.42|42]] And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach:

42: 

[[Exod.28.43|43]] And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they come in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near unto the altar to minister in the holy \[place\]; that they bear not iniquity, and die: \[it shall be\] a statute for ever unto him and his seed after him.

43:
