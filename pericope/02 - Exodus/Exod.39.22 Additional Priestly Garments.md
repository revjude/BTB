[[Exod.39|Exodus 39:22 - Exodus 39:31]]
*Additional Priestly Garments*

[[Exod.39.22|22]] And he made the robe of the ephod \[of\] woven work, all \[of\] blue.

22: 

[[Exod.39.23|23]] And \[there was\] an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, \[with\] a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.

23: 

[[Exod.39.24|24]] And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates \[of\] blue, and purple, and scarlet, \[and\] twined \[linen\].

24: 

[[Exod.39.25|25]] And they made bells \[of\] pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates;

25: 

[[Exod.39.26|26]] A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister \[in\]; as the LORD commanded Moses.

26: 

[[Exod.39.27|27]] And they made coats \[of\] fine linen \[of\] woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,

27: 

[[Exod.39.28|28]] And a mitre \[of\] fine linen, and goodly bonnets \[of\] fine linen, and linen breeches \[of\] fine twined linen,

28: 

[[Exod.39.29|29]] And a girdle \[of\] fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, \[of\] needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.

29: 

[[Exod.39.30|30]] And they made the plate of the holy crown \[of\] pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, \[like to\] the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.

30: 

[[Exod.39.31|31]] And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten \[it\] on high upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.

31:
