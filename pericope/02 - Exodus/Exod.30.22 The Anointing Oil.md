[[Exod.30|Exodus 30:22 - Exodus 30:33]]
*The Anointing Oil*

[[Exod.30.22|22]] Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

22: 

[[Exod.30.23|23]] Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred \[shekels\], and of sweet cinnamon half so much, \[even\] two hundred and fifty \[shekels\], and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty \[shekels\],

23: 

[[Exod.30.24|24]] And of cassia five hundred \[shekels\], after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:

24: 

[[Exod.30.25|25]] And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil.

25: 

[[Exod.30.26|26]] And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,

26: 

[[Exod.30.27|27]] And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense,

27: 

[[Exod.30.28|28]] And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot.

28: 

[[Exod.30.29|29]] And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.

29: 

[[Exod.30.30|30]] And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that \[they\] may minister unto me in the priest’s office.

30: 

[[Exod.30.31|31]] And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.

31: 

[[Exod.30.32|32]] Upon man’s flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make \[any other\] like it, after the composition of it: it \[is\] holy, \[and\] it shall be holy unto you.

32: 

[[Exod.30.33|33]] Whosoever compoundeth \[any\] like it, or whosoever putteth \[any\] of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.

33:
