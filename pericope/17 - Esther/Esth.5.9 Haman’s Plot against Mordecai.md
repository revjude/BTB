[[Esth.5|Esther 5:9 - Esther 5:14]]
*Haman’s Plot against Mordecai*

[[Esth.5.9|9]] Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.

9: 

[[Esth.5.10|10]] Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.

10: 

[[Esth.5.11|11]] And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all \[the things\] wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.

11: 

[[Esth.5.12|12]] Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.

12: 

[[Esth.5.13|13]] Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.

13: 

[[Esth.5.14|14]] Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.

14:
