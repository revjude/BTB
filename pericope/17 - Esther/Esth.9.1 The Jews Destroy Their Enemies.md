[[Esth.9|Esther 9:1 - Esther 9:10]]
*The Jews Destroy Their Enemies*

[[Esth.9.1|1]] Now in the twelfth month, that \[is\], the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)

1: 

[[Esth.9.2|2]] The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.

2: 

[[Esth.9.3|3]] And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.

3: 

[[Esth.9.4|4]] For Mordecai \[was\] great in the king’s house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater.

4: 

[[Esth.9.5|5]] Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them.

5: 

[[Esth.9.6|6]] And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.

6: 

[[Esth.9.7|7]] And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,

7: 

[[Esth.9.8|8]] And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,

8: 

[[Esth.9.9|9]] And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,

9: 

[[Esth.9.10|10]] The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.

10:
