[[Esth.1|Esther 1:13 - Esther 1:22]]
*Queen Vashti Deposed*

[[Esth.1.13|13]] Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so \[was\] the king’s manner toward all that knew law and judgment:

13: 

[[Esth.1.14|14]] And the next unto him \[was\] Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, \[and\] Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king’s face, \[and\] which sat the first in the kingdom;)

14: 

[[Esth.1.15|15]] What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?

15: 

[[Esth.1.16|16]] And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that \[are\] in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.

16: 

[[Esth.1.17|17]] For \[this\] deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.

17: 

[[Esth.1.18|18]] \[Likewise\] shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king’s princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus \[shall there arise\] too much contempt and wrath.

18: 

[[Esth.1.19|19]] If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.

19: 

[[Esth.1.20|20]] And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.

20: 

[[Esth.1.21|21]] And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:

21: 

[[Esth.1.22|22]] For he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that \[it\] should be published according to the language of every people.

22:
