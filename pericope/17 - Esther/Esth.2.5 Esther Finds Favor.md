[[Esth.2|Esther 2:5 - Esther 2:16]]
*Esther Finds Favor*

[[Esth.2.5|5]] \[Now\] in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name \[was\] Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;

5: 

[[Esth.2.6|6]] Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.

6: 

[[Esth.2.7|7]] And he brought up Hadassah, that \[is\], Esther, his uncle’s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid \[was\] fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.

7: 

[[Esth.2.8|8]] So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.

8: 

[[Esth.2.9|9]] And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, \[which were\] meet to be given her, out of the king’s house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best \[place\] of the house of the women.

9: 

[[Esth.2.10|10]] Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew \[it\].

10: 

[[Esth.2.11|11]] And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.

11: 

[[Esth.2.12|12]] Now when every maid’s turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, \[to wit\], six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with \[other\] things for the purifying of the women;)

12: 

[[Esth.2.13|13]] Then thus came \[every\] maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king’s house.

13: 

[[Esth.2.14|14]] In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.

14: 

[[Esth.2.15|15]] Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.

15: 

[[Esth.2.16|16]] So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which \[is\] the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
