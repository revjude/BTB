[[Esth.1|Esther 1:1 - Esther 1:8]]
*Xerxes’ Royal Feast*

[[Esth.1.1|1]] Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this \[is\] Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, \[over\] an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)

1: 

[[Esth.1.2|2]] \[That\] in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which \[was\] in Shushan the palace,

2: 

[[Esth.1.3|3]] In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, \[being\] before him:

3: 

[[Esth.1.4|4]] When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, \[even\] an hundred and fourscore days.

4: 

[[Esth.1.5|5]] And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace;

5: 

[[Esth.1.6|6]] \[Where were\] white, green, and blue, \[hangings\], fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds \[were of\] gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.

6: 

[[Esth.1.7|7]] And they gave \[them\] drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.

7: 

[[Esth.1.8|8]] And the drinking \[was\] according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure.

8:
