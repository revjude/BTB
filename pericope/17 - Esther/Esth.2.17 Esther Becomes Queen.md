[[Esth.2|Esther 2:17 - Esther 2:20]]
*Esther Becomes Queen*

[[Esth.2.17|17]] And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.

17: 

[[Esth.2.18|18]] Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, \[even\] Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.

18: 

[[Esth.2.19|19]] And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king’s gate.

19: 

[[Esth.2.20|20]] Esther had not \[yet\] shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.

20:
