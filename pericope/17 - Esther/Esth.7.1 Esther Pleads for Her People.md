[[Esth.7|Esther 7:1 - Esther 7:6]]
*Esther Pleads for Her People*

[[Esth.7.1|1]] So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.

1: 

[[Esth.7.2|2]] And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What \[is\] thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what \[is\] thy request? and it shall be performed, \[even\] to the half of the kingdom.

2: 

[[Esth.7.3|3]] Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:

3: 

[[Esth.7.4|4]] For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king’s damage.

4: 

[[Esth.7.5|5]] Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?

5: 

[[Esth.7.6|6]] And Esther said, The adversary and enemy \[is\] this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.
