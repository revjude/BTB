[[Esth.9|Esther 9:11 - Esther 9:17]]
*Haman’s Sons Hanged*

[[Esth.9.11|11]] On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.

11: 

[[Esth.9.12|12]] And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? now what \[is\] thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what \[is\] thy request further? and it shall be done.

12: 

[[Esth.9.13|13]] Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which \[are\] in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.

13: 

[[Esth.9.14|14]] And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons.

14: 

[[Esth.9.15|15]] For the Jews that \[were\] in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.

15: 

[[Esth.9.16|16]] But the other Jews that \[were\] in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,

16: 

[[Esth.9.17|17]] On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.

17:
