[[Isa.63|Isaiah 63:15 - Isaiah 63:19]]
*A Prayer for Mercy*

[[Isa.63.15|15]] Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where \[is\] thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained?

15: 

[[Isa.63.16|16]] Doubtless thou \[art\] our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, \[art\] our father, our redeemer; thy name \[is\] from everlasting.

16: 

[[Isa.63.17|17]] O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, \[and\] hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants’ sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.

17: 

[[Isa.63.18|18]] The people of thy holiness have possessed \[it\] but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.

18: 

[[Isa.63.19|19]] We are \[thine\]: thou never barest rule over them; they were not called by thy name.

19:
