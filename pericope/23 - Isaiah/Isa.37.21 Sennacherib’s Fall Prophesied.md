[[Isa.37|Isaiah 37:21 - Isaiah 37:35]]
*Sennacherib’s Fall Prophesied*

[[Isa.37.21|21]] Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria:

21: 

[[Isa.37.22|22]] This \[is\] the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, \[and\] laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.

22: 

[[Isa.37.23|23]] Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted \[thy\] voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? \[even\] against the Holy One of Israel.

23: 

[[Isa.37.24|24]] By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, \[and\] the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, \[and\] the forest of his Carmel.

24: 

[[Isa.37.25|25]] I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.

25: 

[[Isa.37.26|26]] Hast thou not heard long ago, \[how\] I have done it; \[and\] of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities \[into\] ruinous heaps.

26: 

[[Isa.37.27|27]] Therefore their inhabitants \[were\] of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were \[as\] the grass of the field, and \[as\] the green herb, \[as\] the grass on the housetops, and \[as corn\] blasted before it be grown up.

27: 

[[Isa.37.28|28]] But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.

28: 

[[Isa.37.29|29]] Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.

29: 

[[Isa.37.30|30]] And this \[shall be\] a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat \[this\] year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.

30: 

[[Isa.37.31|31]] And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:

31: 

[[Isa.37.32|32]] For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.

32: 

[[Isa.37.33|33]] Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.

33: 

[[Isa.37.34|34]] By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.

34: 

[[Isa.37.35|35]] For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.

35:
