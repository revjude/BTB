[[Isa.43|Isaiah 43:22 - Isaiah 43:28]]
*Israel’s Unfaithfulness*

[[Isa.43.22|22]] But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.

22: 

[[Isa.43.23|23]] Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.

23: 

[[Isa.43.24|24]] Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.

24: 

[[Isa.43.25|25]] I, \[even\] I, \[am\] he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.

25: 

[[Isa.43.26|26]] Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.

26: 

[[Isa.43.27|27]] Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.

27: 

[[Isa.43.28|28]] Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.

28:
