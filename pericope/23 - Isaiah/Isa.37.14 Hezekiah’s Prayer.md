[[Isa.37|Isaiah 37:14 - Isaiah 37:20]]
*Hezekiah’s Prayer*

[[Isa.37.14|14]] And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.

14: 

[[Isa.37.15|15]] And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying,

15: 

[[Isa.37.16|16]] O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest \[between\] the cherubims, thou \[art\] the God, \[even\] thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.

16: 

[[Isa.37.17|17]] Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God.

17: 

[[Isa.37.18|18]] Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,

18: 

[[Isa.37.19|19]] And have cast their gods into the fire: for they \[were\] no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.

19: 

[[Isa.37.20|20]] Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou \[art\] the LORD, \[even\] thou only.

20:
