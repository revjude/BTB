[[Isa.10|Isaiah 10:20 - Isaiah 10:34]]
*A Remnant Shall Return*

[[Isa.10.20|20]] And it shall come to pass in that day, \[that\] the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.

20: 

[[Isa.10.21|21]] The remnant shall return, \[even\] the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.

21: 

[[Isa.10.22|22]] For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, \[yet\] a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.

22: 

[[Isa.10.23|23]] For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land.

23: 

[[Isa.10.24|24]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.

24: 

[[Isa.10.25|25]] For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction.

25: 

[[Isa.10.26|26]] And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and \[as\] his rod \[was\] upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.

26: 

[[Isa.10.27|27]] And it shall come to pass in that day, \[that\] his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.

27: 

[[Isa.10.28|28]] He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages:

28: 

[[Isa.10.29|29]] They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.

29: 

[[Isa.10.30|30]] Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.

30: 

[[Isa.10.31|31]] Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.

31: 

[[Isa.10.32|32]] As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand \[against\] the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.

32: 

[[Isa.10.33|33]] Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature \[shall be\] hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.

33: 

[[Isa.10.34|34]] And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.

34:
