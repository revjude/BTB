[[Isa.30|Isaiah 30:18 - Isaiah 30:33]]
*God Will Be Gracious*

[[Isa.30.18|18]] And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the LORD \[is\] a God of judgment: blessed \[are\] all they that wait for him.

18: 

[[Isa.30.19|19]] For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.

19: 

[[Isa.30.20|20]] And \[though\] the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:

20: 

[[Isa.30.21|21]] And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This \[is\] the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.

21: 

[[Isa.30.22|22]] Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.

22: 

[[Isa.30.23|23]] Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.

23: 

[[Isa.30.24|24]] The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.

24: 

[[Isa.30.25|25]] And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers \[and\] streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.

25: 

[[Isa.30.26|26]] Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.

26: 

[[Isa.30.27|27]] Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning \[with\] his anger, and the burden \[thereof is\] heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:

27: 

[[Isa.30.28|28]] And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and \[there shall be\] a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing \[them\] to err.

28: 

[[Isa.30.29|29]] Ye shall have a song, as in the night \[when\] a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.

29: 

[[Isa.30.30|30]] And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of \[his\] anger, and \[with\] the flame of a devouring fire, \[with\] scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.

30: 

[[Isa.30.31|31]] For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, \[which\] smote with a rod.

31: 

[[Isa.30.32|32]] And \[in\] every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay upon him, \[it\] shall be with tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.

32: 

[[Isa.30.33|33]] For Tophet \[is\] ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made \[it\] deep \[and\] large: the pile thereof \[is\] fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.

33:
