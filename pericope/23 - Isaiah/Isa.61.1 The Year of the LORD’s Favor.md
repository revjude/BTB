[[Isa.61|Isaiah 61:1 - Isaiah 61:11]]
*The Year of the LORD’s Favor*

[[Isa.61.1|1]] The Spirit of the Lord GOD \[is\] upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to \[them that are\] bound;

1: 

[[Isa.61.2|2]] To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;

2: 

[[Isa.61.3|3]] To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.

3: 

[[Isa.61.4|4]] And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.

4: 

[[Isa.61.5|5]] And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien \[shall be\] your plowmen and your vinedressers.

5: 

[[Isa.61.6|6]] But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: \[men\] shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.

6: 

[[Isa.61.7|7]] For your shame \[ye shall have\] double; and \[for\] confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.

7: 

[[Isa.61.8|8]] For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.

8: 

[[Isa.61.9|9]] And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they \[are\] the seed \[which\] the LORD hath blessed.

9: 

[[Isa.61.10|10]] I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh \[himself\] with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth \[herself\] with her jewels.

10: 

[[Isa.61.11|11]] For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.

11:
