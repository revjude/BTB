8: 

[[Isa.37.9|9]] And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard \[it\], he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

9: 

[[Isa.37.10|10]] Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.

11: 

[[Isa.37.12|12]] Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, \[as\] Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which \[were\] in Telassar?

12: 

[[Isa.37.13|13]] Where \[is\] the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?

13:
