[[Isa.50|Isaiah 50:1 - Isaiah 50:3]]
*Israel’s Sin*

[[Isa.50.1|1]] Thus saith the LORD, Where \[is\] the bill of your mother’s divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors \[is it\] to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.

1: 

[[Isa.50.2|2]] Wherefore, when I came, \[was there\] no man? when I called, \[was there\] none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because \[there is\] no water, and dieth for thirst.

2: 

[[Isa.50.3|3]] I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.

3:
