[[Isa.21|Isaiah 21:1 - Isaiah 21:10]]
*Babylon Is Fallen*

[[Isa.21.1|1]] The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; \[so\] it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.

1: 

[[Isa.21.2|2]] A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.

2: 

[[Isa.21.3|3]] Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing \[of it\]; I was dismayed at the seeing \[of it\].

3: 

[[Isa.21.4|4]] My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.

4: 

[[Isa.21.5|5]] Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, \[and\] anoint the shield.

5: 

[[Isa.21.6|6]] For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.

6: 

[[Isa.21.7|7]] And he saw a chariot \[with\] a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, \[and\] a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:

7: 

[[Isa.21.8|8]] And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:

8: 

[[Isa.21.9|9]] And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, \[with\] a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.

9: 

[[Isa.21.10|10]] O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.

10:
