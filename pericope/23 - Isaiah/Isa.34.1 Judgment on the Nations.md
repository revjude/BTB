[[Isa.34|Isaiah 34:1 - Isaiah 34:4]]
*Judgment on the Nations*

[[Isa.34.1|1]] Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of it.

1: 

[[Isa.34.2|2]] For the indignation of the LORD \[is\] upon all nations, and \[his\] fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.

2: 

[[Isa.34.3|3]] Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.

3: 

[[Isa.34.4|4]] And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling \[fig\] from the fig tree.

4:
