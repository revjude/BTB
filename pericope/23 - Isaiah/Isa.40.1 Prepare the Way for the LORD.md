[[Isa.40|Isaiah 40:1 - Isaiah 40:5]]
*Prepare the Way for the LORD*

[[Isa.40.1|1]] Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.

1: 

[[Isa.40.2|2]] Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the LORD’S hand double for all her sins.

2: 

[[Isa.40.3|3]] The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.

3: 

[[Isa.40.4|4]] Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:

4: 

[[Isa.40.5|5]] And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see \[it\] together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken \[it\].

5:
