[[Isa.14|Isaiah 14:1 - Isaiah 14:2]]
*Restoration for Israel*

[[Isa.14.1|1]] For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.

1: 

[[Isa.14.2|2]] And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.

2:
