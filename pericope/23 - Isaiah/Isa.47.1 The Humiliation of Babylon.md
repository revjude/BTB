[[Isa.47|Isaiah 47:1 - Isaiah 47:15]]
*The Humiliation of Babylon*

[[Isa.47.1|1]] Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: \[there is\] no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.

1: 

[[Isa.47.2|2]] Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.

2: 

[[Isa.47.3|3]] Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet \[thee as\] a man.

3: 

[[Isa.47.4|4]] \[As for\] our redeemer, the LORD of hosts \[is\] his name, the Holy One of Israel.

4: 

[[Isa.47.5|5]] Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.

5: 

[[Isa.47.6|6]] I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.

6: 

[[Isa.47.7|7]] And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: \[so\] that thou didst not lay these \[things\] to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it.

7: 

[[Isa.47.8|8]] Therefore hear now this, \[thou that art\] given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I \[am\], and none else beside me; I shall not sit \[as\] a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:

8: 

[[Isa.47.9|9]] But these two \[things\] shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, \[and\] for the great abundance of thine enchantments.

9: 

[[Isa.47.10|10]] For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I \[am\], and none else beside me.

10: 

[[Isa.47.11|11]] Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, \[which\] thou shalt not know.

11: 

[[Isa.47.12|12]] Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.

12: 

[[Isa.47.13|13]] Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from \[these things\] that shall come upon thee.

13: 

[[Isa.47.14|14]] Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: \[there shall\] not \[be\] a coal to warm at, \[nor\] fire to sit before it.

14: 

[[Isa.47.15|15]] Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, \[even\] thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee.

15:
