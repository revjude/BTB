[[Isa.24|Isaiah 24:1 - Isaiah 24:23]]
*God’s Judgment on the Earth*

[[Isa.24.1|1]] Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.

1: 

[[Isa.24.2|2]] And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him.

2: 

[[Isa.24.3|3]] The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the LORD hath spoken this word.

3: 

[[Isa.24.4|4]] The earth mourneth \[and\] fadeth away, the world languisheth \[and\] fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.

4: 

[[Isa.24.5|5]] The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.

5: 

[[Isa.24.6|6]] Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.

6: 

[[Isa.24.7|7]] The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merryhearted do sigh.

7: 

[[Isa.24.8|8]] The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.

8: 

[[Isa.24.9|9]] They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.

9: 

[[Isa.24.10|10]] The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in.

10: 

[[Isa.24.11|11]] \[There is\] a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.

11: 

[[Isa.24.12|12]] In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.

12: 

[[Isa.24.13|13]] When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, \[there shall be\] as the shaking of an olive tree, \[and\] as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.

13: 

[[Isa.24.14|14]] They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.

14: 

[[Isa.24.15|15]] Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, \[even\] the name of the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea.

15: 

[[Isa.24.16|16]] From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, \[even\] glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.

16: 

[[Isa.24.17|17]] Fear, and the pit, and the snare, \[are\] upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.

17: 

[[Isa.24.18|18]] And it shall come to pass, \[that\] he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.

18: 

[[Isa.24.19|19]] The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.

19: 

[[Isa.24.20|20]] The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.

20: 

[[Isa.24.21|21]] And it shall come to pass in that day, \[that\] the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones \[that are\] on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.

21: 

[[Isa.24.22|22]] And they shall be gathered together, \[as\] prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.

22: 

[[Isa.24.23|23]] Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.

23:
