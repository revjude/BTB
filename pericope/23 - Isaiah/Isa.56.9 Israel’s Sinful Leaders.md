[[Isa.56|Isaiah 56:9 - Isaiah 56:12]]
*Israel’s Sinful Leaders*

[[Isa.56.9|9]] All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, \[yea\], all ye beasts in the forest.

9: 

[[Isa.56.10|10]] His watchmen \[are\] blind: they are all ignorant, they \[are\] all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.

10: 

[[Isa.56.11|11]] Yea, \[they are\] greedy dogs \[which\] can never have enough, and they \[are\] shepherds \[that\] cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.

11: 

[[Isa.56.12|12]] Come ye, \[say they\], I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this day, \[and\] much more abundant.

12:
