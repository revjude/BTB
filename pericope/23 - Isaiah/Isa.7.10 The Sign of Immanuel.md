[[Isa.7|Isaiah 7:10 - Isaiah 7:16]]
*The Sign of Immanuel*

[[Isa.7.10|10]] Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying,

10: 

[[Isa.7.11|11]] Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.

11: 

[[Isa.7.12|12]] But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.

12: 

[[Isa.7.13|13]] And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; \[Is it\] a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?

13: 

[[Isa.7.14|14]] Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.

14: 

[[Isa.7.15|15]] Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.

15: 

[[Isa.7.16|16]] For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.

16:
