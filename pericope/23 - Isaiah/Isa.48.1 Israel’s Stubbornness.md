[[Isa.48|Isaiah 48:1 - Isaiah 48:11]]
*Israel’s Stubbornness*

[[Isa.48.1|1]] Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, \[but\] not in truth, nor in righteousness.

1: 

[[Isa.48.2|2]] For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts \[is\] his name.

2: 

[[Isa.48.3|3]] I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did \[them\] suddenly, and they came to pass.

3: 

[[Isa.48.4|4]] Because I knew that thou \[art\] obstinate, and thy neck \[is\] an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;

4: 

[[Isa.48.5|5]] I have even from the beginning declared \[it\] to thee; before it came to pass I shewed \[it\] thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.

5: 

[[Isa.48.6|6]] Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare \[it\]? I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.

6: 

[[Isa.48.7|7]] They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.

7: 

[[Isa.48.8|8]] Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time \[that\] thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.

8: 

[[Isa.48.9|9]] For my name’s sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.

9: 

[[Isa.48.10|10]] Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.

10: 

[[Isa.48.11|11]] For mine own sake, \[even\] for mine own sake, will I do \[it\]: for how should \[my name\] be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another.

11:
