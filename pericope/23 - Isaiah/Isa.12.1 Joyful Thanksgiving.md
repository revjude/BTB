[[Isa.12.1|1]] And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.

1: 

[[Isa.12.2|2]] Behold, God \[is\] my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH \[is\] my strength and \[my\] song; he also is become my salvation.

2: 

[[Isa.12.3|3]] Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.

3: 

[[Isa.12.4|4]] And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.

4: 

[[Isa.12.5|5]] Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this \[is\] known in all the earth.

5: 

[[Isa.12.6|6]] Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great \[is\] the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
