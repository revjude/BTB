[[Isa.25|Isaiah 25:1 - Isaiah 25:12]]
*Praise to the Victorious God*

[[Isa.25.1|1]] O LORD, thou \[art\] my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful \[things; thy\] counsels of old \[are\] faithfulness \[and\] truth.

1: 

[[Isa.25.2|2]] For thou hast made of a city an heap; \[of\] a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.

2: 

[[Isa.25.3|3]] Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.

3: 

[[Isa.25.4|4]] For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones \[is\] as a storm \[against\] the wall.

4: 

[[Isa.25.5|5]] Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; \[even\] the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.

5: 

[[Isa.25.6|6]] And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.

6: 

[[Isa.25.7|7]] And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.

7: 

[[Isa.25.8|8]] He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken \[it\].

8: 

[[Isa.25.9|9]] And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this \[is\] our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this \[is\] the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

9: 

[[Isa.25.10|10]] For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.

10: 

[[Isa.25.11|11]] And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth \[his hands\] to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.

11: 

[[Isa.25.12|12]] And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, \[and\] bring to the ground, \[even\] to the dust.

12:
