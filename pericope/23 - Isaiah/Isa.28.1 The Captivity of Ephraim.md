[[Isa.28|Isaiah 28:1 - Isaiah 28:13]]
*The Captivity of Ephraim*

[[Isa.28.1|1]] Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty \[is\] a fading flower, which \[are\] on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine!

1: 

[[Isa.28.2|2]] Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, \[which\] as a tempest of hail \[and\] a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.

2: 

[[Isa.28.3|3]] The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under feet:

3: 

[[Isa.28.4|4]] And the glorious beauty, which \[is\] on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, \[and\] as the hasty fruit before the summer; which \[when\] he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.

4: 

[[Isa.28.5|5]] In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,

5: 

[[Isa.28.6|6]] And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.

6: 

[[Isa.28.7|7]] But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble \[in\] judgment.

7: 

[[Isa.28.8|8]] For all tables are full of vomit \[and\] filthiness, \[so that there is\] no place \[clean\].

8: 

[[Isa.28.9|9]] Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? \[them that are\] weaned from the milk, \[and\] drawn from the breasts.

9: 

[[Isa.28.10|10]] For precept \[must be\] upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, \[and\] there a little:

10: 

[[Isa.28.11|11]] For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.

11: 

[[Isa.28.12|12]] To whom he said, This \[is\] the rest \[wherewith\] ye may cause the weary to rest; and this \[is\] the refreshing: yet they would not hear.

12: 

[[Isa.28.13|13]] But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, \[and\] there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.

13:
