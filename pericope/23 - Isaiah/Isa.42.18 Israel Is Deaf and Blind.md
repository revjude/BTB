[[Isa.42|Isaiah 42:18 - Isaiah 42:25]]
*Israel Is Deaf and Blind*

[[Isa.42.18|18]] Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.

18: 

[[Isa.42.19|19]] Who \[is\] blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger \[that\] I sent? who \[is\] blind as \[he that is\] perfect, and blind as the LORD’S servant?

19: 

[[Isa.42.20|20]] Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.

20: 

[[Isa.42.21|21]] The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness’ sake; he will magnify the law, and make \[it\] honourable.

21: 

[[Isa.42.22|22]] But this \[is\] a people robbed and spoiled; \[they are\] all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.

22: 

[[Isa.42.23|23]] Who among you will give ear to this? \[who\] will hearken and hear for the time to come?

23: 

[[Isa.42.24|24]] Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.

24: 

[[Isa.42.25|25]] Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid \[it\] not to heart.

25:
