[[Isa.3|Isaiah 3:1 - Isaiah 3:15]]
*Judgment on Jerusalem and Judah*

[[Isa.3.1|1]] For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,

1: 

[[Isa.3.2|2]] The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,

2: 

[[Isa.3.3|3]] The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counseller, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.

3: 

[[Isa.3.4|4]] And I will give children \[to be\] their princes, and babes shall rule over them.

4: 

[[Isa.3.5|5]] And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.

5: 

[[Isa.3.6|6]] When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, \[saying\], Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and \[let\] this ruin \[be\] under thy hand:

6: 

[[Isa.3.7|7]] In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house \[is\] neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.

7: 

[[Isa.3.8|8]] For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings \[are\] against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.

8: 

[[Isa.3.9|9]] The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide \[it\] not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.

9: 

[[Isa.3.10|10]] Say ye to the righteous, that \[it shall be\] well \[with him\]: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.

10: 

[[Isa.3.11|11]] Woe unto the wicked! \[it shall be\] ill \[with him\]: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.

11: 

[[Isa.3.12|12]] \[As for\] my people, children \[are\] their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause \[thee\] to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.

12: 

[[Isa.3.13|13]] The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.

13: 

[[Isa.3.14|14]] The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor \[is\] in your houses.

14: 

[[Isa.3.15|15]] What mean ye \[that\] ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.

15:
