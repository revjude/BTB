[[Isa.48|Isaiah 48:12 - Isaiah 48:22]]
*Deliverance Promised to Israel*

[[Isa.48.12|12]] Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I \[am\] he; I \[am\] the first, I also \[am\] the last.

12: 

[[Isa.48.13|13]] Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: \[when\] I call unto them, they stand up together.

13: 

[[Isa.48.14|14]] All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these \[things\]? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm \[shall be on\] the Chaldeans.

14: 

[[Isa.48.15|15]] I, \[even\] I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.

15: 

[[Isa.48.16|16]] Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there \[am\] I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.

16: 

[[Isa.48.17|17]] Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I \[am\] the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way \[that\] thou shouldest go.

17: 

[[Isa.48.18|18]] O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:

18: 

[[Isa.48.19|19]] Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.

19: 

[[Isa.48.20|20]] Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it \[even\] to the end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob.

20: 

[[Isa.48.21|21]] And they thirsted not \[when\] he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.

21: 

[[Isa.48.22|22]] \[There is\] no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.

22:
