[[Isa.51|Isaiah 51:17 - Isaiah 51:23]]
*God’s Fury Removed*

[[Isa.51.17|17]] Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, \[and\] wrung \[them\] out.

17: 

[[Isa.51.18|18]] \[There is\] none to guide her among all the sons \[whom\] she hath brought forth; neither \[is there any\] that taketh her by the hand of all the sons \[that\] she hath brought up.

18: 

[[Isa.51.19|19]] These two \[things\] are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?

19: 

[[Isa.51.20|20]] Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.

20: 

[[Isa.51.21|21]] Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:

21: 

[[Isa.51.22|22]] Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God \[that\] pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, \[even\] the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again:

22: 

[[Isa.51.23|23]] But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.

23:
