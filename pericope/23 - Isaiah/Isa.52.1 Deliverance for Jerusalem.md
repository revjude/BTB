[[Isa.52|Isaiah 52:1 - Isaiah 52:12]]
*Deliverance for Jerusalem*

[[Isa.52.1|1]] Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.

1: 

[[Isa.52.2|2]] Shake thyself from the dust; arise, \[and\] sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.

2: 

[[Isa.52.3|3]] For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.

3: 

[[Isa.52.4|4]] For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.

4: 

[[Isa.52.5|5]] Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day \[is\] blasphemed.

5: 

[[Isa.52.6|6]] Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore \[they shall know\] in that day that I \[am\] he that doth speak: behold, \[it is\] I.

6: 

[[Isa.52.7|7]] How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!

7: 

[[Isa.52.8|8]] Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion.

8: 

[[Isa.52.9|9]] Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.

9: 

[[Isa.52.10|10]] The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.

10: 

[[Isa.52.11|11]] Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean \[thing\]; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD.

11: 

[[Isa.52.12|12]] For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel \[will be\] your rereward.

12:
