[[Isa.19|Isaiah 19:1 - Isaiah 19:15]]
*The Burden against Egypt*

[[Isa.19.1|1]] The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.

1: 

[[Isa.19.2|2]] And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; city against city, \[and\] kingdom against kingdom.

2: 

[[Isa.19.3|3]] And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.

3: 

[[Isa.19.4|4]] And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts.

4: 

[[Isa.19.5|5]] And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.

5: 

[[Isa.19.6|6]] And they shall turn the rivers far away; \[and\] the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither.

6: 

[[Isa.19.7|7]] The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no \[more\].

7: 

[[Isa.19.8|8]] The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.

8: 

[[Isa.19.9|9]] Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave networks, shall be confounded.

9: 

[[Isa.19.10|10]] And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make sluices \[and\] ponds for fish.

10: 

[[Isa.19.11|11]] Surely the princes of Zoan \[are\] fools, the counsel of the wise counsellers of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I \[am\] the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?

11: 

[[Isa.19.12|12]] Where \[are\] they? where \[are\] thy wise \[men\]? and let them tell thee now, and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt.

12: 

[[Isa.19.13|13]] The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, \[even they that are\] the stay of the tribes thereof.

13: 

[[Isa.19.14|14]] The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof: and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a drunken \[man\] staggereth in his vomit.

14: 

[[Isa.19.15|15]] Neither shall there be \[any\] work for Egypt, which the head or tail, branch or rush, may do.

15:
