[[Isa.9|Isaiah 9:1 - Isaiah 9:7]]
*Unto Us a Child Is Born*

[[Isa.9.1|1]] Nevertheless the dimness \[shall\] not \[be\] such as \[was\] in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict \[her by\] the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.

1: 

[[Isa.9.2|2]] The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.

2: 

[[Isa.9.3|3]] Thou hast multiplied the nation, \[and\] not increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, \[and\] as \[men\] rejoice when they divide the spoil.

3: 

[[Isa.9.4|4]] For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.

4: 

[[Isa.9.5|5]] For every battle of the warrior \[is\] with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but \[this\] shall be with burning \[and\] fuel of fire.

5: 

[[Isa.9.6|6]] For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counseller, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.

6: 

[[Isa.9.7|7]] Of the increase of \[his\] government and peace \[there shall be\] no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.

7:
