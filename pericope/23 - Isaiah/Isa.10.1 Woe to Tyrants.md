[[Isa.10|Isaiah 10:1 - Isaiah 10:4]]
*Woe to Tyrants*

[[Isa.10.1|1]] Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness \[which\] they have prescribed;

1: 

[[Isa.10.2|2]] To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and \[that\] they may rob the fatherless!

2: 

[[Isa.10.3|3]] And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation \[which\] shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?

3: 

[[Isa.10.4|4]] Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand \[is\] stretched out still.

4:
