[[Isa.57|Isaiah 57:3 - Isaiah 57:13]]
*God Condemns Idolatry*

[[Isa.57.3|3]] But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the whore.

3: 

[[Isa.57.4|4]] Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, \[and\] draw out the tongue? \[are\] ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,

4: 

[[Isa.57.5|5]] Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks?

5: 

[[Isa.57.6|6]] Among the smooth \[stones\] of the stream \[is\] thy portion; they, they \[are\] thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these?

6: 

[[Isa.57.7|7]] Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.

7: 

[[Isa.57.8|8]] Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered \[thyself to another\] than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee \[a covenant\] with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest \[it\].

8: 

[[Isa.57.9|9]] And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase \[thyself even\] unto hell.

9: 

[[Isa.57.10|10]] Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; \[yet\] saidst thou not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.

10: 

[[Isa.57.11|11]] And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid \[it\] to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?

11: 

[[Isa.57.12|12]] I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee.

12: 

[[Isa.57.13|13]] When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take \[them\]: but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;

13:
