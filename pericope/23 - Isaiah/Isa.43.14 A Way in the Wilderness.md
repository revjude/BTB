[[Isa.43|Isaiah 43:14 - Isaiah 43:21]]
*A Way in the Wilderness*

[[Isa.43.14|14]] Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry \[is\] in the ships.

14: 

[[Isa.43.15|15]] I \[am\] the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.

15: 

[[Isa.43.16|16]] Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;

16: 

[[Isa.43.17|17]] Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.

17: 

[[Isa.43.18|18]] Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.

18: 

[[Isa.43.19|19]] Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, \[and\] rivers in the desert.

19: 

[[Isa.43.20|20]] The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, \[and\] rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.

20: 

[[Isa.43.21|21]] This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.

21:
