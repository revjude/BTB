[[Isa.30|Isaiah 30:1 - Isaiah 30:17]]
*The Worthless Treaty with Egypt*

[[Isa.30.1|1]] Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:

1: 

[[Isa.30.2|2]] That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!

2: 

[[Isa.30.3|3]] Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt \[your\] confusion.

3: 

[[Isa.30.4|4]] For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.

4: 

[[Isa.30.5|5]] They were all ashamed of a people \[that\] could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.

5: 

[[Isa.30.6|6]] The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence \[come\] the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people \[that\] shall not profit \[them\].

6: 

[[Isa.30.7|7]] For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength \[is\] to sit still.

7: 

[[Isa.30.8|8]] Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:

8: 

[[Isa.30.9|9]] That this \[is\] a rebellious people, lying children, children \[that\] will not hear the law of the LORD:

9: 

[[Isa.30.10|10]] Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:

10: 

[[Isa.30.11|11]] Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.

11: 

[[Isa.30.12|12]] Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:

12: 

[[Isa.30.13|13]] Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.

13: 

[[Isa.30.14|14]] And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters’ vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water \[withal\] out of the pit.

14: 

[[Isa.30.15|15]] For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.

15: 

[[Isa.30.16|16]] But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.

16: 

[[Isa.30.17|17]] One thousand \[shall flee\] at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.

17:
