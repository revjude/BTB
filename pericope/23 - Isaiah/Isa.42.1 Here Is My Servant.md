[[Isa.42|Isaiah 42:1 - Isaiah 42:9]]
*Here Is My Servant*

[[Isa.42.1|1]] Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, \[in whom\] my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.

1: 

[[Isa.42.2|2]] He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.

2: 

[[Isa.42.3|3]] A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.

3: 

[[Isa.42.4|4]] He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.

4: 

[[Isa.42.5|5]] Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:

5: 

[[Isa.42.6|6]] I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;

6: 

[[Isa.42.7|7]] To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, \[and\] them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.

7: 

[[Isa.42.8|8]] I \[am\] the LORD: that \[is\] my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.

8: 

[[Isa.42.9|9]] Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.

9:
