[[Isa.44|Isaiah 44:1 - Isaiah 44:20]]
*The LORD Has Chosen Israel*

[[Isa.44.1|1]] Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:

1: 

[[Isa.44.2|2]] Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, \[which\] will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.

2: 

[[Isa.44.3|3]] For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:

3: 

[[Isa.44.4|4]] And they shall spring up \[as\] among the grass, as willows by the water courses.

4: 

[[Isa.44.5|5]] One shall say, I \[am\] the LORD’S; and another shall call \[himself\] by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe \[with\] his hand unto the LORD, and surname \[himself\] by the name of Israel.

5: 

[[Isa.44.6|6]] Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I \[am\] the first, and I \[am\] the last; and beside me \[there is\] no God.

6: 

[[Isa.44.7|7]] And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.

7: 

[[Isa.44.8|8]] Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared \[it\]? ye \[are\] even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, \[there is\] no God; I know not \[any\].

8: 

[[Isa.44.9|9]] They that make a graven image \[are\] all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they \[are\] their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.

9: 

[[Isa.44.10|10]] Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image \[that\] is profitable for nothing?

10: 

[[Isa.44.11|11]] Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they \[are\] of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; \[yet\] they shall fear, \[and\] they shall be ashamed together.

11: 

[[Isa.44.12|12]] The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint.

12: 

[[Isa.44.13|13]] The carpenter stretcheth out \[his\] rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.

13: 

[[Isa.44.14|14]] He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish \[it\].

14: 

[[Isa.44.15|15]] Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth \[it\], and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth \[it\]; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.

15: 

[[Isa.44.16|16]] He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth \[himself\], and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire:

16: 

[[Isa.44.17|17]] And the residue thereof he maketh a god, \[even\] his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth \[it\], and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou \[art\] my god.

17: 

[[Isa.44.18|18]] They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; \[and\] their hearts, that they cannot understand.

18: 

[[Isa.44.19|19]] And none considereth in his heart, neither \[is there\] knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten \[it\]: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?

19: 

[[Isa.44.20|20]] He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, \[Is there\] not a lie in my right hand?
