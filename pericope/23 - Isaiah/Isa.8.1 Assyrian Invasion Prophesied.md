[[Isa.8|Isaiah 8:1 - Isaiah 8:10]]
*Assyrian Invasion Prophesied*

[[Isa.8.1|1]] Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man’s pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.

1: 

[[Isa.8.2|2]] And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

2: 

[[Isa.8.3|3]] And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.

3: 

[[Isa.8.4|4]] For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.

4: 

[[Isa.8.5|5]] The LORD spake also unto me again, saying,

5: 

[[Isa.8.6|6]] Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son;

6: 

[[Isa.8.7|7]] Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, \[even\] the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:

7: 

[[Isa.8.8|8]] And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach \[even\] to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.

8: 

[[Isa.8.9|9]] Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.

9: 

[[Isa.8.10|10]] Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God \[is\] with us.

10:
