[[Isa.9|Isaiah 9:18 - Isaiah 9:21]]
*Judgment against Israel’s Unrepentance*

[[Isa.9.18|18]] For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up \[like\] the lifting up of smoke.

18: 

[[Isa.9.19|19]] Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his brother.

19: 

[[Isa.9.20|20]] And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:

20: 

[[Isa.9.21|21]] Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: \[and\] they together \[shall be\] against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand \[is\] stretched out still.

21:
