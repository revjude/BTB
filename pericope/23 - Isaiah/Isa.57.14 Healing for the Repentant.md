[[Isa.57|Isaiah 57:14 - Isaiah 57:21]]
*Healing for the Repentant*

[[Isa.57.14|14]] And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.

14: 

[[Isa.57.15|15]] For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name \[is\] Holy; I dwell in the high and holy \[place\], with him also \[that is\] of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.

15: 

[[Isa.57.16|16]] For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls \[which\] I have made.

16: 

[[Isa.57.17|17]] For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.

17: 

[[Isa.57.18|18]] I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.

18: 

[[Isa.57.19|19]] I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to \[him that is\] far off, and to \[him that is\] near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him.

19: 

[[Isa.57.20|20]] But the wicked \[are\] like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.

20: 

[[Isa.57.21|21]] \[There is\] no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.

21:
