[[Isa.44|Isaiah 44:21 - Isaiah 44:28]]
*Jerusalem to Be Restored*

[[Isa.44.21|21]] Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou \[art\] my servant: I have formed thee; thou \[art\] my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me.

21: 

[[Isa.44.22|22]] I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.

22: 

[[Isa.44.23|23]] Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done \[it\]: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.

23: 

[[Isa.44.24|24]] Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I \[am\] the LORD that maketh all \[things\]; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself;

24: 

[[Isa.44.25|25]] That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise \[men\] backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;

25: 

[[Isa.44.26|26]] That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:

26: 

[[Isa.44.27|27]] That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:

27: 

[[Isa.44.28|28]] That saith of Cyrus, \[He is\] my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.

28:
