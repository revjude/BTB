[[Isa.10|Isaiah 10:5 - Isaiah 10:19]]
*Judgment on Assyria*

[[Isa.10.5|5]] O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation.

5: 

[[Isa.10.6|6]] I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.

6: 

[[Isa.10.7|7]] Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but \[it is\] in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.

7: 

[[Isa.10.8|8]] For he saith, \[Are\] not my princes altogether kings?

8: 

[[Isa.10.9|9]] \[Is\] not Calno as Carchemish? \[is\] not Hamath as Arpad? \[is\] not Samaria as Damascus?

9: 

[[Isa.10.10|10]] As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;

10: 

[[Isa.10.11|11]] Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?

11: 

[[Isa.10.12|12]] Wherefore it shall come to pass, \[that\] when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.

12: 

[[Isa.10.13|13]] For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done \[it\], and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant \[man\]:

13: 

[[Isa.10.14|14]] And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs \[that are\] left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.

14: 

[[Isa.10.15|15]] Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? \[or\] shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake \[itself\] against them that lift it up, \[or\] as if the staff should lift up \[itself, as if it were\] no wood.

15: 

[[Isa.10.16|16]] Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.

16: 

[[Isa.10.17|17]] And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;

17: 

[[Isa.10.18|18]] And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth.

18: 

[[Isa.10.19|19]] And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.

19:
