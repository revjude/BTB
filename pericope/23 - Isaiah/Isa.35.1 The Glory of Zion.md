[[Isa.35|Isaiah 35:1 - Isaiah 35:10]]
*The Glory of Zion*

[[Isa.35.1|1]] The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.

1: 

[[Isa.35.2|2]] It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the LORD, \[and\] the excellency of our God.

2: 

[[Isa.35.3|3]] Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.

3: 

[[Isa.35.4|4]] Say to them \[that are\] of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come \[with\] vengeance, \[even\] God \[with\] a recompence; he will come and save you.

4: 

[[Isa.35.5|5]] Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.

5: 

[[Isa.35.6|6]] Then shall the lame \[man\] leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.

6: 

[[Isa.35.7|7]] And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, \[shall be\] grass with reeds and rushes.

7: 

[[Isa.35.8|8]] And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it \[shall be\] for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err \[therein\].

8: 

[[Isa.35.9|9]] No lion shall be there, nor \[any\] ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk \[there\]:

9: 

[[Isa.35.10|10]] And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.

10:
