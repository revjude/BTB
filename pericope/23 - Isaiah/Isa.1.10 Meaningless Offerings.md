[[Isa.1|Isaiah 1:10 - Isaiah 1:20]]
*Meaningless Offerings*

[[Isa.1.10|10]] Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.

10: 

[[Isa.1.11|11]] To what purpose \[is\] the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.

11: 

[[Isa.1.12|12]] When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?

12: 

[[Isa.1.13|13]] Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; \[it is\] iniquity, even the solemn meeting.

13: 

[[Isa.1.14|14]] Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear \[them\].

14: 

[[Isa.1.15|15]] And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.

15: 

[[Isa.1.16|16]] Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;

16: 

[[Isa.1.17|17]] Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.

17: 

[[Isa.1.18|18]] Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.

18: 

[[Isa.1.19|19]] If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:

19: 

[[Isa.1.20|20]] But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken \[it\].

20:
