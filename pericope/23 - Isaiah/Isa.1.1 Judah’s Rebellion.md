[[Isa.1|Isaiah 1:1 - Isaiah 1:9]]
*Judah’s Rebellion*

[[Isa.1.1|1]] The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, \[and\] Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

1: 

[[Isa.1.2|2]] Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.

2: 

[[Isa.1.3|3]] The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: \[but\] Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.

3: 

[[Isa.1.4|4]] Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.

4: 

[[Isa.1.5|5]] Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.

5: 

[[Isa.1.6|6]] From the sole of the foot even unto the head \[there is\] no soundness in it; \[but\] wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.

6: 

[[Isa.1.7|7]] Your country \[is\] desolate, your cities \[are\] burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and \[it is\] desolate, as overthrown by strangers.

7: 

[[Isa.1.8|8]] And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.

8: 

[[Isa.1.9|9]] Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, \[and\] we should have been like unto Gomorrah.

9:
