[[Isa.66|Isaiah 66:1 - Isaiah 66:6]]
*Heaven Is My Throne*

[[Isa.66.1|1]] Thus saith the LORD, The heaven \[is\] my throne, and the earth \[is\] my footstool: where \[is\] the house that ye build unto me? and where \[is\] the place of my rest?

1: 

[[Isa.66.2|2]] For all those \[things\] hath mine hand made, and all those \[things\] have been, saith the LORD: but to this \[man\] will I look, \[even\] to \[him that is\] poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.

2: 

[[Isa.66.3|3]] He that killeth an ox \[is as if\] he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, \[as if\] he cut off a dog’s neck; he that offereth an oblation, \[as if he offered\] swine’s blood; he that burneth incense, \[as if\] he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.

3: 

[[Isa.66.4|4]] I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose \[that\] in which I delighted not.

4: 

[[Isa.66.5|5]] Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name’s sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.

5: 

[[Isa.66.6|6]] A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies.

6:
