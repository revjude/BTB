[[Isa.1|Isaiah 1:21 - Isaiah 1:31]]
*The Corruption of Zion*

[[Isa.1.21|21]] How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.

21: 

[[Isa.1.22|22]] Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:

22: 

[[Isa.1.23|23]] Thy princes \[are\] rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.

23: 

[[Isa.1.24|24]] Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:

24: 

[[Isa.1.25|25]] And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:

25: 

[[Isa.1.26|26]] And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellers as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.

26: 

[[Isa.1.27|27]] Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.

27: 

[[Isa.1.28|28]] And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners \[shall be\] together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.

28: 

[[Isa.1.29|29]] For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.

29: 

[[Isa.1.30|30]] For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.

30: 

[[Isa.1.31|31]] And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench \[them\].

31:
