[[Isa.8|Isaiah 8:19 - Isaiah 8:22]]
*Darkness and Light*

[[Isa.8.19|19]] And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead?

19: 

[[Isa.8.20|20]] To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, \[it is\] because \[there is\] no light in them.

20: 

[[Isa.8.21|21]] And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward.

21: 

[[Isa.8.22|22]] And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and \[they shall be\] driven to darkness.

22:
