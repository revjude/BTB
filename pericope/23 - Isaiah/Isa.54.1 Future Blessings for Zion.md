[[Isa.54|Isaiah 54:1 - Isaiah 54:17]]
*Future Blessings for Zion*

[[Isa.54.1|1]] Sing, O barren, thou \[that\] didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou \[that\] didst not travail with child: for more \[are\] the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD.

1: 

[[Isa.54.2|2]] Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes;

2: 

[[Isa.54.3|3]] For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.

3: 

[[Isa.54.4|4]] Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.

4: 

[[Isa.54.5|5]] For thy Maker \[is\] thine husband; the LORD of hosts \[is\] his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.

5: 

[[Isa.54.6|6]] For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.

6: 

[[Isa.54.7|7]] For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.

7: 

[[Isa.54.8|8]] In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer.

8: 

[[Isa.54.9|9]] For this \[is as\] the waters of Noah unto me: for \[as\] I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.

9: 

[[Isa.54.10|10]] For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.

10: 

[[Isa.54.11|11]] O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, \[and\] not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.

11: 

[[Isa.54.12|12]] And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.

12: 

[[Isa.54.13|13]] And all thy children \[shall be\] taught of the LORD; and great \[shall be\] the peace of thy children.

13: 

[[Isa.54.14|14]] In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.

14: 

[[Isa.54.15|15]] Behold, they shall surely gather together, \[but\] not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.

15: 

[[Isa.54.16|16]] Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.

16: 

[[Isa.54.17|17]] No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue \[that\] shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This \[is\] the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness \[is\] of me, saith the LORD.

17:
