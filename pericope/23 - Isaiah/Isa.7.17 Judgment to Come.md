[[Isa.7|Isaiah 7:17 - Isaiah 7:25]]
*Judgment to Come*

[[Isa.7.17|17]] The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father’s house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; \[even\] the king of Assyria.

17: 

[[Isa.7.18|18]] And it shall come to pass in that day, \[that\] the LORD shall hiss for the fly that \[is\] in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that \[is\] in the land of Assyria.

18: 

[[Isa.7.19|19]] And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.

19: 

[[Isa.7.20|20]] In the same day shall the Lord shave with a rasor that is hired, \[namely\], by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.

20: 

[[Isa.7.21|21]] And it shall come to pass in that day, \[that\] a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;

21: 

[[Isa.7.22|22]] And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk \[that\] they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.

22: 

[[Isa.7.23|23]] And it shall come to pass in that day, \[that\] every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall \[even\] be for briers and thorns.

23: 

[[Isa.7.24|24]] With arrows and with bows shall \[men\] come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.

24: 

[[Isa.7.25|25]] And \[on\] all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.

25:
