[[Isa.32|Isaiah 32:9 - Isaiah 32:20]]
*The Women of Jerusalem*

[[Isa.32.9|9]] Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless daughters; give ear unto my speech.

9: 

[[Isa.32.10|10]] Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.

10: 

[[Isa.32.11|11]] Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird \[sackcloth\] upon \[your\] loins.

11: 

[[Isa.32.12|12]] They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.

12: 

[[Isa.32.13|13]] Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns \[and\] briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy \[in\] the joyous city:

13: 

[[Isa.32.14|14]] Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;

14: 

[[Isa.32.15|15]] Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.

15: 

[[Isa.32.16|16]] Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field.

16: 

[[Isa.32.17|17]] And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.

17: 

[[Isa.32.18|18]] And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;

18: 

[[Isa.32.19|19]] When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be low in a low place.

19: 

[[Isa.32.20|20]] Blessed \[are\] ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth \[thither\] the feet of the ox and the ass.

20:
