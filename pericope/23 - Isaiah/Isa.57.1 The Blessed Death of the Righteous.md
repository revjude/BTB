*The Blessed Death of the Righteous*

[[Isa.57.1|1]] The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth \[it\] to heart: and merciful men \[are\] taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil \[to come\].

[[Isa.57.2|2]] He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, \[each one\] walking \[in\] his uprightness.
