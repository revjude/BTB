[[Isa.65|Isaiah 65:1 - Isaiah 65:16]]
*Judgments and Promises*

[[Isa.65.1|1]] I am sought of \[them that\] asked not \[for me\]; I am found of \[them that\] sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation \[that\] was not called by my name.

1: 

[[Isa.65.2|2]] I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way \[that was\] not good, after their own thoughts;

2: 

[[Isa.65.3|3]] A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;

3: 

[[Isa.65.4|4]] Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine’s flesh, and broth of abominable \[things is in\] their vessels;

4: 

[[Isa.65.5|5]] Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These \[are\] a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.

5: 

[[Isa.65.6|6]] Behold, \[it is\] written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,

6: 

[[Isa.65.7|7]] Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.

7: 

[[Isa.65.8|8]] Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and \[one\] saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing \[is\] in it: so will I do for my servants’ sakes, that I may not destroy them all.

8: 

[[Isa.65.9|9]] And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.

9: 

[[Isa.65.10|10]] And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.

10: 

[[Isa.65.11|11]] But ye \[are\] they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.

11: 

[[Isa.65.12|12]] Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose \[that\] wherein I delighted not.

12: 

[[Isa.65.13|13]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:

13: 

[[Isa.65.14|14]] Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.

14: 

[[Isa.65.15|15]] And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:

15: 

[[Isa.65.16|16]] That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.

16:
