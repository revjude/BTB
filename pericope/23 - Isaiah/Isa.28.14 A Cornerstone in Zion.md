[[Isa.28|Isaiah 28:14 - Isaiah 28:22]]
*A Cornerstone in Zion*

[[Isa.28.14|14]] Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule this people which \[is\] in Jerusalem.

14: 

[[Isa.28.15|15]] Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:

15: 

[[Isa.28.16|16]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner \[stone\], a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.

16: 

[[Isa.28.17|17]] Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.

17: 

[[Isa.28.18|18]] And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.

18: 

[[Isa.28.19|19]] From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only \[to\] understand the report.

19: 

[[Isa.28.20|20]] For the bed is shorter than that \[a man\] can stretch himself \[on it\]: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself \[in it\].

20: 

[[Isa.28.21|21]] For the LORD shall rise up as \[in\] mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as \[in\] the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.

21: 

[[Isa.28.22|22]] Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.

22:
