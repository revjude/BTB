[[Isa.41|Isaiah 41:1 - Isaiah 41:20]]
*God’s Help to Israel*

[[Isa.41.1|1]] Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew \[their\] strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come near together to judgment.

1: 

[[Isa.41.2|2]] Who raised up the righteous \[man\] from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made \[him\] rule over kings? he gave \[them\] as the dust to his sword, \[and\] as driven stubble to his bow.

2: 

[[Isa.41.3|3]] He pursued them, \[and\] passed safely; \[even\] by the way \[that\] he had not gone with his feet.

3: 

[[Isa.41.4|4]] Who hath wrought and done \[it\], calling the generations from the beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I \[am\] he.

4: 

[[Isa.41.5|5]] The isles saw \[it\], and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came.

5: 

[[Isa.41.6|6]] They helped every one his neighbour; and \[every one\] said to his brother, Be of good courage.

6: 

[[Isa.41.7|7]] So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, \[and\] he that smootheth \[with\] the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It \[is\] ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, \[that\] it should not be moved.

7: 

[[Isa.41.8|8]] But thou, Israel, \[art\] my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.

8: 

[[Isa.41.9|9]] \[Thou\] whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou \[art\] my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.

9: 

[[Isa.41.10|10]] Fear thou not; for I \[am\] with thee: be not dismayed; for I \[am\] thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.

10: 

[[Isa.41.11|11]] Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee shall perish.

11: 

[[Isa.41.12|12]] Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, \[even\] them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.

12: 

[[Isa.41.13|13]] For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.

13: 

[[Isa.41.14|14]] Fear not, thou worm Jacob, \[and\] ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith the LORD, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.

14: 

[[Isa.41.15|15]] Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat \[them\] small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.

15: 

[[Isa.41.16|16]] Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, \[and\] shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.

16: 

[[Isa.41.17|17]] \[When\] the poor and needy seek water, and \[there is\] none, \[and\] their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, \[I\] the God of Israel will not forsake them.

17: 

[[Isa.41.18|18]] I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.

18: 

[[Isa.41.19|19]] I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, \[and\] the pine, and the box tree together:

19: 

[[Isa.41.20|20]] That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.

20:
