[[Isa.22|Isaiah 22:15 - Isaiah 22:25]]
*A Message for Shebna*

[[Isa.22.15|15]] Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get thee unto this treasurer, \[even\] unto Shebna, which \[is\] over the house, \[and say\],

15: 

[[Isa.22.16|16]] What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here, \[as\] he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high, \[and\] that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock?

16: 

[[Isa.22.17|17]] Behold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity, and will surely cover thee.

17: 

[[Isa.22.18|18]] He will surely violently turn and toss thee \[like\] a ball into a large country: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy glory \[shall be\] the shame of thy lord’s house.

18: 

[[Isa.22.19|19]] And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state shall he pull thee down.

19: 

[[Isa.22.20|20]] And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:

20: 

[[Isa.22.21|21]] And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand: and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.

21: 

[[Isa.22.22|22]] And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.

22: 

[[Isa.22.23|23]] And I will fasten him \[as\] a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father’s house.

23: 

[[Isa.22.24|24]] And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father’s house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons.

24: 

[[Isa.22.25|25]] In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fall; and the burden that \[was\] upon it shall be cut off: for the LORD hath spoken \[it\].

25:
