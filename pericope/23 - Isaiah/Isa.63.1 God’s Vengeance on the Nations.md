[[Isa.63|Isaiah 63:1 - Isaiah 63:6]]
*God’s Vengeance on the Nations*

[[Isa.63.1|1]] Who \[is\] this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this \[that is\] glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.

1: 

[[Isa.63.2|2]] Wherefore \[art thou\] red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat?

2: 

[[Isa.63.3|3]] I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people \[there was\] none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.

3: 

[[Isa.63.4|4]] For the day of vengeance \[is\] in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.

4: 

[[Isa.63.5|5]] And I looked, and \[there was\] none to help; and I wondered that \[there was\] none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.

5: 

[[Isa.63.6|6]] And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.

6:
