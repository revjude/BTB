[[Isa.6|Isaiah 6:1 - Isaiah 6:13]]
*Isaiah’s Commission*

[[Isa.6.1|1]] In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.

1: 

[[Isa.6.2|2]] Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.

2: 

[[Isa.6.3|3]] And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, \[is\] the LORD of hosts: the whole earth \[is\] full of his glory.

3: 

[[Isa.6.4|4]] And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.

4: 

[[Isa.6.5|5]] Then said I, Woe \[is\] me! for I am undone; because I \[am\] a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.

5: 

[[Isa.6.6|6]] Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, \[which\] he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:

6: 

[[Isa.6.7|7]] And he laid \[it\] upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.

7: 

[[Isa.6.8|8]] Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here \[am\] I; send me.

8: 

[[Isa.6.9|9]] And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.

9: 

[[Isa.6.10|10]] Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.

10: 

[[Isa.6.11|11]] Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,

11: 

[[Isa.6.12|12]] And the LORD have removed men far away, and \[there be\] a great forsaking in the midst of the land.

12: 

[[Isa.6.13|13]] But yet in it \[shall be\] a tenth, and \[it\] shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance \[is\] in them, when they cast \[their leaves: so\] the holy seed \[shall be\] the substance thereof.

13:
