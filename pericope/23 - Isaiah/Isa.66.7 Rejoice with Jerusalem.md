[[Isa.66|Isaiah 66:7 - Isaiah 66:14]]
*Rejoice with Jerusalem*

[[Isa.66.7|7]] Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.

7: 

[[Isa.66.8|8]] Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? \[or\] shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.

8: 

[[Isa.66.9|9]] Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut \[the womb\]? saith thy God.

9: 

[[Isa.66.10|10]] Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:

10: 

[[Isa.66.11|11]] That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.

11: 

[[Isa.66.12|12]] For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon \[her\] sides, and be dandled upon \[her\] knees.

12: 

[[Isa.66.13|13]] As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.

13: 

[[Isa.66.14|14]] And when ye see \[this\], your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, and \[his\] indignation toward his enemies.

14:
