[[Isa.19|Isaiah 19:16 - Isaiah 19:25]]
*A Blessing upon the Earth*

[[Isa.19.16|16]] In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which he shaketh over it.

16: 

[[Isa.19.17|17]] And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he hath determined against it.

17: 

[[Isa.19.18|18]] In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called, The city of destruction.

18: 

[[Isa.19.19|19]] In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD.

19: 

[[Isa.19.20|20]] And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the LORD because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them.

20: 

[[Isa.19.21|21]] And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform \[it\].

21: 

[[Isa.19.22|22]] And the LORD shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal \[it\]: and they shall return \[even\] to the LORD, and he shall be intreated of them, and shall heal them.

22: 

[[Isa.19.23|23]] In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.

23: 

[[Isa.19.24|24]] In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, \[even\] a blessing in the midst of the land:

24: 

[[Isa.19.25|25]] Whom the LORD of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed \[be\] Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.

25:
