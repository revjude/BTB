[[Isa.53|Isaiah 53:1 - Isaiah 53:8]]
*The Suffering Servant*

[[Isa.53.1|1]] Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?

1: 

[[Isa.53.2|2]] For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, \[there is\] no beauty that we should desire him.

2: 

[[Isa.53.3|3]] He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were \[our\] faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.

3: 

[[Isa.53.4|4]] Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.

4: 

[[Isa.53.5|5]] But he \[was\] wounded for our transgressions, \[he was\] bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace \[was\] upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.

5: 

[[Isa.53.6|6]] All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.

6: 

[[Isa.53.7|7]] He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.

7: 

[[Isa.53.8|8]] He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.

8:
