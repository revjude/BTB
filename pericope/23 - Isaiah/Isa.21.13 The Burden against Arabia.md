[[Isa.21|Isaiah 21:13 - Isaiah 21:17]]
*The Burden against Arabia*

[[Isa.21.13|13]] The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.

13: 

[[Isa.21.14|14]] The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.

14: 

[[Isa.21.15|15]] For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.

15: 

[[Isa.21.16|16]] For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:

16: 

[[Isa.21.17|17]] And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken \[it\].

17:
