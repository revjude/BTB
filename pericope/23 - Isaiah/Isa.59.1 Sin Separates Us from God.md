[[Isa.59|Isaiah 59:1 - Isaiah 59:17]]
*Sin Separates Us from God*

[[Isa.59.1|1]] Behold, the LORD’S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:

1: 

[[Isa.59.2|2]] But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid \[his\] face from you, that he will not hear.

2: 

[[Isa.59.3|3]] For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness.

3: 

[[Isa.59.4|4]] None calleth for justice, nor \[any\] pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.

4: 

[[Isa.59.5|5]] They hatch cockatrice’ eggs, and weave the spider’s web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.

5: 

[[Isa.59.6|6]] Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works \[are\] works of iniquity, and the act of violence \[is\] in their hands.

6: 

[[Isa.59.7|7]] Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts \[are\] thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction \[are\] in their paths.

7: 

[[Isa.59.8|8]] The way of peace they know not; and \[there is\] no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace.

8: 

[[Isa.59.9|9]] Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, \[but\] we walk in darkness.

9: 

[[Isa.59.10|10]] We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if \[we had\] no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the night; \[we are\] in desolate places as dead \[men\].

10: 

[[Isa.59.11|11]] We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but \[there is\] none; for salvation, \[but\] it is far off from us.

11: 

[[Isa.59.12|12]] For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions \[are\] with us; and \[as for\] our iniquities, we know them;

12: 

[[Isa.59.13|13]] In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.

13: 

[[Isa.59.14|14]] And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.

14: 

[[Isa.59.15|15]] Yea, truth faileth; and he \[that\] departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the LORD saw \[it\], and it displeased him that \[there was\] no judgment.

15: 

[[Isa.59.16|16]] And he saw that \[there was\] no man, and wondered that \[there was\] no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.

16: 

[[Isa.59.17|17]] For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance \[for\] clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke.

17:
