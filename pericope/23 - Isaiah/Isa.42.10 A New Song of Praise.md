[[Isa.42|Isaiah 42:10 - Isaiah 42:17]]
*A New Song of Praise*

[[Isa.42.10|10]] Sing unto the LORD a new song, \[and\] his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.

10: 

[[Isa.42.11|11]] Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up \[their voice\], the villages \[that\] Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.

11: 

[[Isa.42.12|12]] Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands.

12: 

[[Isa.42.13|13]] The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.

13: 

[[Isa.42.14|14]] I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, \[and\] refrained myself: \[now\] will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.

14: 

[[Isa.42.15|15]] I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.

15: 

[[Isa.42.16|16]] And I will bring the blind by a way \[that\] they knew not; I will lead them in paths \[that\] they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.

16: 

[[Isa.42.17|17]] They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye \[are\] our gods.

17:
