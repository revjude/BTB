[[Isa.38|Isaiah 38:9 - Isaiah 38:22]]
*Hezekiah’s Song of Thanksgiving*

[[Isa.38.9|9]] The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:

9: 

[[Isa.38.10|10]] I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.

10: 

[[Isa.38.11|11]] I said, I shall not see the LORD, \[even\] the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.

11: 

[[Isa.38.12|12]] Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd’s tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day \[even\] to night wilt thou make an end of me.

12: 

[[Isa.38.13|13]] I reckoned till morning, \[that\], as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day \[even\] to night wilt thou make an end of me.

13: 

[[Isa.38.14|14]] Like a crane \[or\] a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail \[with looking\] upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.

14: 

[[Isa.38.15|15]] What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done \[it\]: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.

15: 

[[Isa.38.16|16]] O Lord, by these \[things men\] live, and in all these \[things is\] the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.

16: 

[[Isa.38.17|17]] Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul \[delivered it\] from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.

17: 

[[Isa.38.18|18]] For the grave cannot praise thee, death can \[not\] celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.

18: 

[[Isa.38.19|19]] The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I \[do\] this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.

19: 

[[Isa.38.20|20]] The LORD \[was ready\] to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.

20: 

[[Isa.38.21|21]] For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay \[it\] for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.

21: 

[[Isa.38.22|22]] Hezekiah also had said, What \[is\] the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?

22:
