[[Isa.8|Isaiah 8:11 - Isaiah 8:18]]
*A Call to Fear God*

[[Isa.8.11|11]] For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,

11: 

[[Isa.8.12|12]] Say ye not, A confederacy, to all \[them to\] whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.

12: 

[[Isa.8.13|13]] Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and \[let\] him \[be\] your fear, and \[let\] him \[be\] your dread.

13: 

[[Isa.8.14|14]] And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

14: 

[[Isa.8.15|15]] And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.

15: 

[[Isa.8.16|16]] Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.

16: 

[[Isa.8.17|17]] And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.

17: 

[[Isa.8.18|18]] Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me \[are\] for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion.

18:
