[[Isa.33|Isaiah 33:1 - Isaiah 33:24]]
*The LORD Is Exalted*

[[Isa.33.1|1]] Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou \[wast\] not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; \[and\] when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.

1: 

[[Isa.33.2|2]] O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.

2: 

[[Isa.33.3|3]] At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.

3: 

[[Isa.33.4|4]] And your spoil shall be gathered \[like\] the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.

4: 

[[Isa.33.5|5]] The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.

5: 

[[Isa.33.6|6]] And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, \[and\] strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD \[is\] his treasure.

6: 

[[Isa.33.7|7]] Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.

7: 

[[Isa.33.8|8]] The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.

8: 

[[Isa.33.9|9]] The earth mourneth \[and\] languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed \[and\] hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off \[their fruits\].

9: 

[[Isa.33.10|10]] Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.

10: 

[[Isa.33.11|11]] Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, \[as\] fire, shall devour you.

11: 

[[Isa.33.12|12]] And the people shall be \[as\] the burnings of lime: \[as\] thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.

12: 

[[Isa.33.13|13]] Hear, ye \[that are\] far off, what I have done; and, ye \[that are\] near, acknowledge my might.

13: 

[[Isa.33.14|14]] The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?

14: 

[[Isa.33.15|15]] He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;

15: 

[[Isa.33.16|16]] He shall dwell on high: his place of defence \[shall be\] the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters \[shall be\] sure.

16: 

[[Isa.33.17|17]] Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.

17: 

[[Isa.33.18|18]] Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where \[is\] the scribe? where \[is\] the receiver? where \[is\] he that counted the towers?

18: 

[[Isa.33.19|19]] Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, \[that thou canst\] not understand.

19: 

[[Isa.33.20|20]] Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle \[that\] shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.

20: 

[[Isa.33.21|21]] But there the glorious LORD \[will be\] unto us a place of broad rivers \[and\] streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.

21: 

[[Isa.33.22|22]] For the LORD \[is\] our judge, the LORD \[is\] our lawgiver, the LORD \[is\] our king; he will save us.

22: 

[[Isa.33.23|23]] Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.

23: 

[[Isa.33.24|24]] And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein \[shall be\] forgiven \[their\] iniquity.

24:
