[[Isa.5|Isaiah 5:1 - Isaiah 5:7]]
*The Song of the Vineyard*

[[Isa.5.1|1]] Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:

1: 

[[Isa.5.2|2]] And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.

2: 

[[Isa.5.3|3]] And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.

3: 

[[Isa.5.4|4]] What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?

4: 

[[Isa.5.5|5]] And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; \[and\] break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:

5: 

[[Isa.5.6|6]] And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.

6: 

[[Isa.5.7|7]] For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts \[is\] the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.

7:
