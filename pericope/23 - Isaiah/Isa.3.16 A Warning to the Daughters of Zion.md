[[Isa.3|Isaiah 3:16 - Isaiah 3:26]]
*A Warning to the Daughters of Zion*

[[Isa.3.16|16]] Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing \[as\] they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:

16: 

[[Isa.3.17|17]] Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.

17: 

[[Isa.3.18|18]] In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of \[their\] tinkling ornaments \[about their feet\], and \[their\] cauls, and \[their\] round tires like the moon,

18: 

[[Isa.3.19|19]] The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,

19: 

[[Isa.3.20|20]] The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,

20: 

[[Isa.3.21|21]] The rings, and nose jewels,

21: 

[[Isa.3.22|22]] The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,

22: 

[[Isa.3.23|23]] The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.

23: 

[[Isa.3.24|24]] And it shall come to pass, \[that\] instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; \[and\] burning instead of beauty.

24: 

[[Isa.3.25|25]] Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.

25: 

[[Isa.3.26|26]] And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she \[being\] desolate shall sit upon the ground.

26:
