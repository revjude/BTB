[[Isa.14|Isaiah 14:28 - Isaiah 14:32]]
*Philistia Will Be Destroyed*

[[Isa.14.28|28]] In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.

28: 

[[Isa.14.29|29]] Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent’s root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit \[shall be\] a fiery flying serpent.

29: 

[[Isa.14.30|30]] And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant.

30: 

[[Isa.14.31|31]] Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, \[art\] dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none \[shall be\] alone in his appointed times.

31: 

[[Isa.14.32|32]] What shall \[one\] then answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORD hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it.

32:
