[[Isa.53|Isaiah 53:9 - Isaiah 53:12]]
*A Grave Assigned*

[[Isa.53.9|9]] And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither \[was any\] deceit in his mouth.

9: 

[[Isa.53.10|10]] Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put \[him\] to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see \[his\] seed, he shall prolong \[his\] days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.

10: 

[[Isa.53.11|11]] He shall see of the travail of his soul, \[and\] shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.

11: 

[[Isa.53.12|12]] Therefore will I divide him \[a portion\] with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

12:
