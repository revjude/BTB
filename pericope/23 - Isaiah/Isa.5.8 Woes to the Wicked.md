[[Isa.5|Isaiah 5:8 - Isaiah 5:30]]
*Woes to the Wicked*

[[Isa.5.8|8]] Woe unto them that join house to house, \[that\] lay field to field, till \[there be\] no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!

8: 

[[Isa.5.9|9]] In mine ears \[said\] the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, \[even\] great and fair, without inhabitant.

9: 

[[Isa.5.10|10]] Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.

10: 

[[Isa.5.11|11]] Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, \[that\] they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, \[till\] wine inflame them!

11: 

[[Isa.5.12|12]] And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.

12: 

[[Isa.5.13|13]] Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because \[they have\] no knowledge: and their honourable men \[are\] famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.

13: 

[[Isa.5.14|14]] Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.

14: 

[[Isa.5.15|15]] And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:

15: 

[[Isa.5.16|16]] But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.

16: 

[[Isa.5.17|17]] Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.

17: 

[[Isa.5.18|18]] Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:

18: 

[[Isa.5.19|19]] That say, Let him make speed, \[and\] hasten his work, that we may see \[it\]: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know \[it\]!

19: 

[[Isa.5.20|20]] Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!

20: 

[[Isa.5.21|21]] Woe unto \[them that are\] wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!

21: 

[[Isa.5.22|22]] Woe unto \[them that are\] mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:

22: 

[[Isa.5.23|23]] Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!

23: 

[[Isa.5.24|24]] Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, \[so\] their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.

24: 

[[Isa.5.25|25]] Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases \[were\] torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand \[is\] stretched out still.

25: 

[[Isa.5.26|26]] And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:

26: 

[[Isa.5.27|27]] None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:

27: 

[[Isa.5.28|28]] Whose arrows \[are\] sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses’ hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:

28: 

[[Isa.5.29|29]] Their roaring \[shall be\] like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry \[it\] away safe, and none shall deliver \[it\].

29: 

[[Isa.5.30|30]] And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if \[one\] look unto the land, behold darkness \[and\] sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.

30:
