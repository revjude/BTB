[[Isa.41|Isaiah 41:21 - Isaiah 41:29]]
*Meaningless Idols*

[[Isa.41.21|21]] Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong \[reasons\], saith the King of Jacob.

21: 

[[Isa.41.22|22]] Let them bring \[them\] forth, and shew us what shall happen: let them shew the former things, what they \[be\], that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come.

22: 

[[Isa.41.23|23]] Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye \[are\] gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold \[it\] together.

23: 

[[Isa.41.24|24]] Behold, ye \[are\] of nothing, and your work of nought: an abomination \[is he that\] chooseth you.

24: 

[[Isa.41.25|25]] I have raised up \[one\] from the north, and he shall come: from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall come upon princes as \[upon\] morter, and as the potter treadeth clay.

25: 

[[Isa.41.26|26]] Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, \[He is\] righteous? yea, \[there is\] none that sheweth, yea, \[there is\] none that declareth, yea, \[there is\] none that heareth your words.

26: 

[[Isa.41.27|27]] The first \[shall say\] to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.

27: 

[[Isa.41.28|28]] For I beheld, and \[there was\] no man; even among them, and \[there was\] no counseller, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.

28: 

[[Isa.41.29|29]] Behold, they \[are\] all vanity; their works \[are\] nothing: their molten images \[are\] wind and confusion.

29:
