[[Isa.43|Isaiah 43:1 - Isaiah 43:13]]
*Israel’s Only Savior*

[[Isa.43.1|1]] But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called \[thee\] by thy name; thou \[art\] mine.

1: 

[[Isa.43.2|2]] When thou passest through the waters, I \[will be\] with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.

2: 

[[Isa.43.3|3]] For I \[am\] the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt \[for\] thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.

3: 

[[Isa.43.4|4]] Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.

4: 

[[Isa.43.5|5]] Fear not: for I \[am\] with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;

5: 

[[Isa.43.6|6]] I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;

6: 

[[Isa.43.7|7]] \[Even\] every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.

7: 

[[Isa.43.8|8]] Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.

8: 

[[Isa.43.9|9]] Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, \[It is\] truth.

9: 

[[Isa.43.10|10]] Ye \[are\] my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I \[am\] he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.

10: 

[[Isa.43.11|11]] I, \[even\] I, \[am\] the LORD; and beside me \[there is\] no saviour.

11: 

[[Isa.43.12|12]] I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when \[there was\] no strange \[god\] among you: therefore ye \[are\] my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I \[am\] God.

12: 

[[Isa.43.13|13]] Yea, before the day \[was\] I \[am\] he; and \[there is\] none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?

13:
