[[Isa.34|Isaiah 34:5 - Isaiah 34:17]]
*Judgment on Edom*

[[Isa.34.5|5]] For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.

5: 

[[Isa.34.6|6]] The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, \[and\] with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.

6: 

[[Isa.34.7|7]] And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.

7: 

[[Isa.34.8|8]] For \[it is\] the day of the LORD’S vengeance, \[and\] the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion.

8: 

[[Isa.34.9|9]] And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.

9: 

[[Isa.34.10|10]] It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.

10: 

[[Isa.34.11|11]] But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.

11: 

[[Isa.34.12|12]] They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none \[shall be\] there, and all her princes shall be nothing.

12: 

[[Isa.34.13|13]] And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, \[and\] a court for owls.

13: 

[[Isa.34.14|14]] The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.

14: 

[[Isa.34.15|15]] There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.

15: 

[[Isa.34.16|16]] Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.

16: 

[[Isa.34.17|17]] And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.

17:
