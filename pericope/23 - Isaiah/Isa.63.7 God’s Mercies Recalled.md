[[Isa.63|Isaiah 63:7 - Isaiah 63:14]]
*God’s Mercies Recalled*

[[Isa.63.7|7]] I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, \[and\] the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.

7: 

[[Isa.63.8|8]] For he said, Surely they \[are\] my people, children \[that\] will not lie: so he was their Saviour.

8: 

[[Isa.63.9|9]] In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.

9: 

[[Isa.63.10|10]] But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, \[and\] he fought against them.

10: 

[[Isa.63.11|11]] Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, \[and\] his people, \[saying\], Where \[is\] he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where \[is\] he that put his holy Spirit within him?

11: 

[[Isa.63.12|12]] That led \[them\] by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?

12: 

[[Isa.63.13|13]] That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, \[that\] they should not stumble?

13: 

[[Isa.63.14|14]] As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.

14:
