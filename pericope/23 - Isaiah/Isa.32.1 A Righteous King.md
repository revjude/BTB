[[Isa.32|Isaiah 32:1 - Isaiah 32:8]]
*A Righteous King*

[[Isa.32.1|1]] Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.

1: 

[[Isa.32.2|2]] And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.

2: 

[[Isa.32.3|3]] And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.

3: 

[[Isa.32.4|4]] The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.

4: 

[[Isa.32.5|5]] The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said \[to be\] bountiful.

5: 

[[Isa.32.6|6]] For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.

6: 

[[Isa.32.7|7]] The instruments also of the churl \[are\] evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right.

7: 

[[Isa.32.8|8]] But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand.

8:
