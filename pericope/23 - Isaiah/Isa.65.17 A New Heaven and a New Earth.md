[[Isa.65|Isaiah 65:17 - Isaiah 65:25]]
*A New Heaven and a New Earth*

[[Isa.65.17|17]] For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.

17: 

[[Isa.65.18|18]] But be ye glad and rejoice for ever \[in that\] which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.

18: 

[[Isa.65.19|19]] And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.

19: 

[[Isa.65.20|20]] There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner \[being\] an hundred years old shall be accursed.

20: 

[[Isa.65.21|21]] And they shall build houses, and inhabit \[them\]; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.

21: 

[[Isa.65.22|22]] They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree \[are\] the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.

22: 

[[Isa.65.23|23]] They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they \[are\] the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.

23: 

[[Isa.65.24|24]] And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.

24: 

[[Isa.65.25|25]] The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust \[shall be\] the serpent’s meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.

25:
