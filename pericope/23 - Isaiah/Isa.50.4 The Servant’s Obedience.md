[[Isa.50|Isaiah 50:4 - Isaiah 50:11]]
*The Servant’s Obedience*

[[Isa.50.4|4]] The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to \[him that is\] weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.

4: 

[[Isa.50.5|5]] The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.

5: 

[[Isa.50.6|6]] I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.

6: 

[[Isa.50.7|7]] For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.

7: 

[[Isa.50.8|8]] \[He is\] near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who \[is\] mine adversary? let him come near to me.

8: 

[[Isa.50.9|9]] Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who \[is\] he \[that\] shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.

9: 

[[Isa.50.10|10]] Who \[is\] among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh \[in\] darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.

10: 

[[Isa.50.11|11]] Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass \[yourselves\] about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks \[that\] ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.

11:
