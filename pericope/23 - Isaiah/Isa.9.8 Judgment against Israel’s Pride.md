[[Isa.9|Isaiah 9:8 - Isaiah 9:12]]
*Judgment against Israel’s Pride*

[[Isa.9.8|8]] The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.

8: 

[[Isa.9.9|9]] And all the people shall know, \[even\] Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,

9: 

[[Isa.9.10|10]] The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change \[them into\] cedars.

10: 

[[Isa.9.11|11]] Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together;

11: 

[[Isa.9.12|12]] The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand \[is\] stretched out still.

12:
