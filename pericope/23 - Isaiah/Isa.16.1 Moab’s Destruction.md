[[Isa.16|Isaiah 16:1 - Isaiah 16:14]]
*Moab’s Destruction*

[[Isa.16.1|1]] Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.

1: 

[[Isa.16.2|2]] For it shall be, \[that\], as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, \[so\] the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.

2: 

[[Isa.16.3|3]] Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth.

3: 

[[Isa.16.4|4]] Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.

4: 

[[Isa.16.5|5]] And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.

5: 

[[Isa.16.6|6]] We have heard of the pride of Moab; \[he is\] very proud: \[even\] of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: \[but\] his lies \[shall\] not \[be\] so.

6: 

[[Isa.16.7|7]] Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn; surely \[they are\] stricken.

7: 

[[Isa.16.8|8]] For the fields of Heshbon languish, \[and\] the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come \[even\] unto Jazer, they wandered \[through\] the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.

8: 

[[Isa.16.9|9]] Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.

9: 

[[Isa.16.10|10]] And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in \[their\] presses; I have made \[their vintage\] shouting to cease.

10: 

[[Isa.16.11|11]] Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kirharesh.

11: 

[[Isa.16.12|12]] And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.

12: 

[[Isa.16.13|13]] This \[is\] the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that time.

13: 

[[Isa.16.14|14]] But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant \[shall be\] very small \[and\] feeble.

14:
