[[Isa.52|Isaiah 52:13 - Isaiah 52:15]]
*The Servant Exalted*

[[Isa.52.13|13]] Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.

13: 

[[Isa.52.14|14]] As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:

14: 

[[Isa.52.15|15]] So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for \[that\] which had not been told them shall they see; and \[that\] which they had not heard shall they consider.

15:
