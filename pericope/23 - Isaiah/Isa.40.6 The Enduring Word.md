[[Isa.40|Isaiah 40:6 - Isaiah 40:8]]
*The Enduring Word*

[[Isa.40.6|6]] The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh \[is\] grass, and all the goodliness thereof \[is\] as the flower of the field:

6: 

[[Isa.40.7|7]] The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people \[is\] grass.

7: 

[[Isa.40.8|8]] The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.

8:
