[[Isa.40|Isaiah 40:9 - Isaiah 40:31]]
*Here Is Your God!*

[[Isa.40.9|9]] O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift \[it\] up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!

9: 

[[Isa.40.10|10]] Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong \[hand\], and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward \[is\] with him, and his work before him.

10: 

[[Isa.40.11|11]] He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry \[them\] in his bosom, \[and\] shall gently lead those that are with young.

11: 

[[Isa.40.12|12]] Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?

12: 

[[Isa.40.13|13]] Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or \[being\] his counseller hath taught him?

13: 

[[Isa.40.14|14]] With whom took he counsel, and \[who\] instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?

14: 

[[Isa.40.15|15]] Behold, the nations \[are\] as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.

15: 

[[Isa.40.16|16]] And Lebanon \[is\] not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.

16: 

[[Isa.40.17|17]] All nations before him \[are\] as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.

17: 

[[Isa.40.18|18]] To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?

18: 

[[Isa.40.19|19]] The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.

19: 

[[Isa.40.20|20]] He that \[is\] so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree \[that\] will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, \[that\] shall not be moved.

20: 

[[Isa.40.21|21]] Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?

21: 

[[Isa.40.22|22]] \[It is\] he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof \[are\] as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:

22: 

[[Isa.40.23|23]] That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.

23: 

[[Isa.40.24|24]] Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.

24: 

[[Isa.40.25|25]] To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One.

25: 

[[Isa.40.26|26]] Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these \[things\], that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that \[he is\] strong in power; not one faileth.

26: 

[[Isa.40.27|27]] Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?

27: 

[[Isa.40.28|28]] Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, \[that\] the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? \[there is\] no searching of his understanding.

28: 

[[Isa.40.29|29]] He giveth power to the faint; and to \[them that have\] no might he increaseth strength.

29: 

[[Isa.40.30|30]] Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:

30: 

[[Isa.40.31|31]] But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew \[their\] strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; \[and\] they shall walk, and not faint.

31:
