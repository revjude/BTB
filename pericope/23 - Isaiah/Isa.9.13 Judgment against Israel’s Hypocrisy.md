[[Isa.9|Isaiah 9:13 - Isaiah 9:17]]
*Judgment against Israel’s Hypocrisy*

[[Isa.9.13|13]] For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts.

13: 

[[Isa.9.14|14]] Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day.

14: 

[[Isa.9.15|15]] The ancient and honourable, he \[is\] the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he \[is\] the tail.

15: 

[[Isa.9.16|16]] For the leaders of this people cause \[them\] to err; and \[they that are\] led of them \[are\] destroyed.

16: 

[[Isa.9.17|17]] Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one \[is\] an hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand \[is\] stretched out still.

17:
