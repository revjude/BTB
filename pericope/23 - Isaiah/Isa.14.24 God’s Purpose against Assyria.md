[[Isa.14|Isaiah 14:24 - Isaiah 14:27]]
*God’s Purpose against Assyria*

[[Isa.14.24|24]] The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, \[so\] shall it stand:

24: 

[[Isa.14.25|25]] That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.

25: 

[[Isa.14.26|26]] This \[is\] the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this \[is\] the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.

26: 

[[Isa.14.27|27]] For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul \[it\]? and his hand \[is\] stretched out, and who shall turn it back?

27:
