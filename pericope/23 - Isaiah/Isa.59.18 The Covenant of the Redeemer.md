[[Isa.59|Isaiah 59:18 - Isaiah 59:21]]
*The Covenant of the Redeemer*

[[Isa.59.18|18]] According to \[their\] deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence.

18: 

[[Isa.59.19|19]] So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.

19: 

[[Isa.59.20|20]] And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.

20: 

[[Isa.59.21|21]] As for me, this \[is\] my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that \[is\] upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.

21:
