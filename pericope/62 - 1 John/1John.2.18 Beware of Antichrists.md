[[1John.2|1 John 2:18 - 1 John 2:23]]
*Beware of Antichrists*

[[1John.2.18|18]] Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.

18: 

[[1John.2.19|19]] They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would \[no doubt\] have continued with us: but \[they went out\], that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.

19: 

[[1John.2.20|20]] But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.

20: 

[[1John.2.21|21]] I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.

21: 

[[1John.2.22|22]] Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.

22: 

[[1John.2.23|23]] Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: \[(but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also\].

23:
