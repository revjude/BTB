[[1John.3|1 John 3:11 - 1 John 3:24]]
*Love One Another*

[[1John.3.11|11]] For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.

11: 

[[1John.3.12|12]] Not as Cain, \[who\] was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.

12: 

[[1John.3.13|13]] Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.

13: 

[[1John.3.14|14]] We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not \[his\] brother abideth in death.

14: 

[[1John.3.15|15]] Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.

15: 

[[1John.3.16|16]] Hereby perceive we the love \[of God\], because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down \[our\] lives for the brethren.

16: 

[[1John.3.17|17]] But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels \[of compassion\] from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?

17: 

[[1John.3.18|18]] My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.

18: 

[[1John.3.19|19]] And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.

19: 

[[1John.3.20|20]] For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.

20: 

[[1John.3.21|21]] Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, \[then\] have we confidence toward God.

21: 

[[1John.3.22|22]] And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.

22: 

[[1John.3.23|23]] And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.

23: 

[[1John.3.24|24]] And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.

24:
