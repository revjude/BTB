[[1John.5|1 John 5:13 - 1 John 5:17]]
*Effective Prayer*

[[1John.5.13|13]] These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.

13: 

[[1John.5.14|14]] And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:

14: 

[[1John.5.15|15]] And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.

15: 

[[1John.5.16|16]] If any man see his brother sin a sin \[which is\] not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.

16: 

[[1John.5.17|17]] All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.

17:
