[[1John.2|1 John 2:15 - 1 John 2:17]]
*Do Not Love the World*

[[1John.2.15|15]] Love not the world, neither the things \[that are\] in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

15: 

[[1John.2.16|16]] For all that \[is\] in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.

16: 

[[1John.2.17|17]] And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.

17:
