[[1John.2|1 John 2:24 - 1 John 2:29]]
*Remain in Christ*

[[1John.2.24|24]] Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.

24: 

[[1John.2.25|25]] And this is the promise that he hath promised us, \[even\] eternal life.

25: 

[[1John.2.26|26]] These \[things\] have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.

26: 

[[1John.2.27|27]] But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.

27: 

[[1John.2.28|28]] And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.

28: 

[[1John.2.29|29]] If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.

29:
