[[1John.2|1 John 2:1 - 1 John 2:6]]
*Jesus Our Advocate*

[[1John.2.1|1]] My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:

1: 

[[1John.2.2|2]] And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for \[the sins of\] the whole world.

2: 

[[1John.2.3|3]] And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.

3: 

[[1John.2.4|4]] He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

4: 

[[1John.2.5|5]] But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.

5: 

[[1John.2.6|6]] He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.

6:
