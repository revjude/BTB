[[1John.5|1 John 5:1 - 1 John 5:8]]
*Overcoming the World*

[[1John.5.1|1]] Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.

1: 

[[1John.5.2|2]] By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.

2: 

[[1John.5.3|3]] For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.

3: 

[[1John.5.4|4]] For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, \[even\] our faith.

4: 

[[1John.5.5|5]] Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?

5: 

[[1John.5.6|6]] This is he that came by water and blood, \[even\] Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.

6: 

[[1John.5.7|7]] For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.

7: 

[[1John.5.8|8]] And there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.

8:
