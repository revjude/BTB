[[1John.2|1 John 2:7 - 1 John 2:14]]
*A New Commandment*

[[1John.2.7|7]] Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.

7: 

[[1John.2.8|8]] Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.

8: 

[[1John.2.9|9]] He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.

9: 

[[1John.2.10|10]] He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.

10: 

[[1John.2.11|11]] But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.

11: 

[[1John.2.12|12]] I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.

12: 

[[1John.2.13|13]] I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him \[that is\] from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.

13: 

[[1John.2.14|14]] I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him \[that is\] from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.

14:
