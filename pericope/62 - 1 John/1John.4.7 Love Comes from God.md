[[1John.4|1 John 4:7 - 1 John 4:21]]
*Love Comes from God*

[[1John.4.7|7]] Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.

7: 

[[1John.4.8|8]] He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.

8: 

[[1John.4.9|9]] In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.

9: 

[[1John.4.10|10]] Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son \[to be\] the propitiation for our sins.

10: 

[[1John.4.11|11]] Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.

11: 

[[1John.4.12|12]] No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.

12: 

[[1John.4.13|13]] Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.

13: 

[[1John.4.14|14]] And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son \[to be\] the Saviour of the world.

14: 

[[1John.4.15|15]] Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.

15: 

[[1John.4.16|16]] And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.

16: 

[[1John.4.17|17]] Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.

17: 

[[1John.4.18|18]] There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.

18: 

[[1John.4.19|19]] We love him, because he first loved us.

19: 

[[1John.4.20|20]] If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?

20: 

[[1John.4.21|21]] And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.

21:
