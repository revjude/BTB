[[1John.3|1 John 3:1 - 1 John 3:10]]
*Children of God*

[[1John.3.1|1]] Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.

1: 

[[1John.3.2|2]] Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.

2: 

[[1John.3.3|3]] And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.

3: 

[[1John.3.4|4]] Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.

4: 

[[1John.3.5|5]] And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.

5: 

[[1John.3.6|6]] Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.

6: 

[[1John.3.7|7]] Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.

7: 

[[1John.3.8|8]] He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.

8: 

[[1John.3.9|9]] Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.

9: 

[[1John.3.10|10]] In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.

10:
