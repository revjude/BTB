[[1John.5|1 John 5:18 - 1 John 5:21]]
*The True God*

[[1John.5.18|18]] We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.

18: 

[[1John.5.19|19]] \[And\] we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.

19: 

[[1John.5.20|20]] And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, \[even\] in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.

20: 

[[1John.5.21|21]] Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.

21:
