[[1John.5|1 John 5:9 - 1 John 5:12]]
*God’s Testimony about His Son*

[[1John.5.9|9]] If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.

9: 

[[1John.5.10|10]] He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.

10: 

[[1John.5.11|11]] And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.

11: 

[[1John.5.12|12]] He that hath the Son hath life; \[and\] he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.

12:
