[[1John.4|1 John 4:1 - 1 John 4:6]]
*Testing the Spirits*

[[1John.4.1|1]] Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.

1: 

[[1John.4.2|2]] Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:

2: 

[[1John.4.3|3]] And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that \[spirit\] of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.

3: 

[[1John.4.4|4]] Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.

4: 

[[1John.4.5|5]] They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.

5: 

[[1John.4.6|6]] We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.

6:
