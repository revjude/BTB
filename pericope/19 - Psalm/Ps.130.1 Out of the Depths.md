2: 

[[Ps.130.3|3]] If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?

[[Ps.130.4|4]] But \[there is\] forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.

4: 

[[Ps.130.5|5]] I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.

5: 

[[Ps.130.6|6]] My soul \[waiteth\] for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: \[I say, more than\] they that watch for the morning.
