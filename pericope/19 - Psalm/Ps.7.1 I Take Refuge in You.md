[[Ps.7|Psalm 7:1 - Psalm 7:17]]
*I Take Refuge in You*

[[Ps.7.0|0]] Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite.

0: 

[[Ps.7.1|1]] O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:

1: 

[[Ps.7.2|2]] Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending \[it\] in pieces, while \[there is\] none to deliver.

2: 

[[Ps.7.3|3]] O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;

3: 

[[Ps.7.4|4]] If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)

4: 

[[Ps.7.5|5]] Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take \[it\]; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.

5: 

[[Ps.7.6|6]] Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me \[to\] the judgment \[that\] thou hast commanded.

6: 

[[Ps.7.7|7]] So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.

7: 

[[Ps.7.8|8]] The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity \[that is\] in me.

8: 

[[Ps.7.9|9]] Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.

9: 

[[Ps.7.10|10]] My defence \[is\] of God, which saveth the upright in heart.

10: 

[[Ps.7.11|11]] God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry \[with the wicked\] every day.

11: 

[[Ps.7.12|12]] If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.

12: 

[[Ps.7.13|13]] He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.

13: 

[[Ps.7.14|14]] Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.

14: 

[[Ps.7.15|15]] He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch \[which\] he made.

15: 

[[Ps.7.16|16]] His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.

16: 

[[Ps.7.17|17]] I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.

17:
