[[Ps.104|Psalm 104:1 - Psalm 104:35]]
*How Many Are Your Works, O LORD!*

[[Ps.104.1|1]] Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.

1: 

[[Ps.104.2|2]] Who coverest \[thyself\] with light as \[with\] a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:

2: 

[[Ps.104.3|3]] Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:

3: 

[[Ps.104.4|4]] Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:

4: 

[[Ps.104.5|5]] \[Who\] laid the foundations of the earth, \[that\] it should not be removed for ever.

5: 

[[Ps.104.6|6]] Thou coveredst it with the deep as \[with\] a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.

6: 

[[Ps.104.7|7]] At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.

7: 

[[Ps.104.8|8]] They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.

8: 

[[Ps.104.9|9]] Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.

9: 

[[Ps.104.10|10]] He sendeth the springs into the valleys, \[which\] run among the hills.

10: 

[[Ps.104.11|11]] They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.

11: 

[[Ps.104.12|12]] By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, \[which\] sing among the branches.

12: 

[[Ps.104.13|13]] He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.

13: 

[[Ps.104.14|14]] He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;

14: 

[[Ps.104.15|15]] And wine \[that\] maketh glad the heart of man, \[and\] oil to make \[his\] face to shine, and bread \[which\] strengtheneth man’s heart.

15: 

[[Ps.104.16|16]] The trees of the LORD are full \[of sap\]; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;

16: 

[[Ps.104.17|17]] Where the birds make their nests: \[as for\] the stork, the fir trees \[are\] her house.

17: 

[[Ps.104.18|18]] The high hills \[are\] a refuge for the wild goats; \[and\] the rocks for the conies.

18: 

[[Ps.104.19|19]] He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.

19: 

[[Ps.104.20|20]] Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep \[forth\].

20: 

[[Ps.104.21|21]] The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.

21: 

[[Ps.104.22|22]] The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.

22: 

[[Ps.104.23|23]] Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.

23: 

[[Ps.104.24|24]] O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.

24: 

[[Ps.104.25|25]] \[So is\] this great and wide sea, wherein \[are\] things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.

25: 

[[Ps.104.26|26]] There go the ships: \[there is\] that leviathan, \[whom\] thou hast made to play therein.

26: 

[[Ps.104.27|27]] These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give \[them\] their meat in due season.

27: 

[[Ps.104.28|28]] \[That\] thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.

28: 

[[Ps.104.29|29]] Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.

29: 

[[Ps.104.30|30]] Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.

30: 

[[Ps.104.31|31]] The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.

31: 

[[Ps.104.32|32]] He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.

32: 

[[Ps.104.33|33]] I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.

33: 

[[Ps.104.34|34]] My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.

34: 

[[Ps.104.35|35]] Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.

35:
