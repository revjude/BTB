[[Ps.51|Psalm 51:1 - Psalm 51:19]]
*Create in Me a Clean Heart, O God*

[[Ps.51.0|0]] To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.

0: 

[[Ps.51.1|1]] Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.

1: 

[[Ps.51.2|2]] Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.

2: 

[[Ps.51.3|3]] For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin \[is\] ever before me.

3: 

[[Ps.51.4|4]] Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done \[this\] evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, \[and\] be clear when thou judgest.

4: 

[[Ps.51.5|5]] Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.

5: 

[[Ps.51.6|6]] Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden \[part\] thou shalt make me to know wisdom.

6: 

[[Ps.51.7|7]] Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

7: 

[[Ps.51.8|8]] Make me to hear joy and gladness; \[that\] the bones \[which\] thou hast broken may rejoice.

8: 

[[Ps.51.9|9]] Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.

9: 

[[Ps.51.10|10]] Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.

10: 

[[Ps.51.11|11]] Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.

11: 

[[Ps.51.12|12]] Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me \[with thy\] free spirit.

12: 

[[Ps.51.13|13]] \[Then\] will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.

13: 

[[Ps.51.14|14]] Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: \[and\] my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.

14: 

[[Ps.51.15|15]] O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.

15: 

[[Ps.51.16|16]] For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give \[it\]: thou delightest not in burnt offering.

16: 

[[Ps.51.17|17]] The sacrifices of God \[are\] a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

17: 

[[Ps.51.18|18]] Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.

18: 

[[Ps.51.19|19]] Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.

19:
