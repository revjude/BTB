[[Ps.75|Psalm 75:1 - Psalm 75:10]]
*God’s Righteous Judgment*

[[Ps.75.0|0]] To the chief Musician, Altaschith, A Psalm \[or\] Song of Asaph.

0: 

[[Ps.75.1|1]] Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, \[unto thee\] do we give thanks: for \[that\] thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.

1: 

[[Ps.75.2|2]] When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.

2: 

[[Ps.75.3|3]] The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.

3: 

[[Ps.75.4|4]] I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:

4: 

[[Ps.75.5|5]] Lift not up your horn on high: speak \[not with\] a stiff neck.

5: 

[[Ps.75.6|6]] For promotion \[cometh\] neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.

6: 

[[Ps.75.7|7]] But God \[is\] the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.

7: 

[[Ps.75.8|8]] For in the hand of the LORD \[there is\] a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring \[them\] out, \[and\] drink \[them\].

8: 

[[Ps.75.9|9]] But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.

9: 

[[Ps.75.10|10]] All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; \[but\] the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.

10:
