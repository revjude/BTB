[[Ps.31|Psalm 31:1 - Psalm 31:24]]
*Into Your Hands I Commit My Spirit*

[[Ps.31.0|0]] To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

0: 

[[Ps.31.1|1]] In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness.

1: 

[[Ps.31.2|2]] Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.

2: 

[[Ps.31.3|3]] For thou \[art\] my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name’s sake lead me, and guide me.

3: 

[[Ps.31.4|4]] Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou \[art\] my strength.

4: 

[[Ps.31.5|5]] Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.

5: 

[[Ps.31.6|6]] I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.

6: 

[[Ps.31.7|7]] I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;

7: 

[[Ps.31.8|8]] And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.

8: 

[[Ps.31.9|9]] Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, \[yea\], my soul and my belly.

9: 

[[Ps.31.10|10]] For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.

10: 

[[Ps.31.11|11]] I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.

11: 

[[Ps.31.12|12]] I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.

12: 

[[Ps.31.13|13]] For I have heard the slander of many: fear \[was\] on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.

13: 

[[Ps.31.14|14]] But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou \[art\] my God.

14: 

[[Ps.31.15|15]] My times \[are\] in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.

15: 

[[Ps.31.16|16]] Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies’ sake.

16: 

[[Ps.31.17|17]] Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, \[and\] let them be silent in the grave.

17: 

[[Ps.31.18|18]] Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.

18: 

[[Ps.31.19|19]] \[Oh\] how great \[is\] thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; \[which\] thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!

19: 

[[Ps.31.20|20]] Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.

20: 

[[Ps.31.21|21]] Blessed \[be\] the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.

21: 

[[Ps.31.22|22]] For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.

22: 

[[Ps.31.23|23]] O love the LORD, all ye his saints: \[for\] the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.

23: 

[[Ps.31.24|24]] Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.

24:
