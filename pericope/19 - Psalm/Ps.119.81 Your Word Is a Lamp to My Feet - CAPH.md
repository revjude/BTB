[[Ps.119|Psalm 119:81 - Psalm 119:88]]
*Your Word Is a Lamp to My Feet - CAPH*

[[Ps.119.81|81]] My soul fainteth for thy salvation: \[but\] I hope in thy word.

81: 

[[Ps.119.82|82]] Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?

82: 

[[Ps.119.83|83]] For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; \[yet\] do I not forget thy statutes.

83: 

[[Ps.119.84|84]] How many \[are\] the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?

84: 

[[Ps.119.85|85]] The proud have digged pits for me, which \[are\] not after thy law.

85: 

[[Ps.119.86|86]] All thy commandments \[are\] faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.

86: 

[[Ps.119.87|87]] They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.

87: 

[[Ps.119.88|88]] Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.

88:
