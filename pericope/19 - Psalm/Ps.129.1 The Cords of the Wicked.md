*The Cords of the Wicked*

[[Ps.129.0|0]] A Song of degrees.

0: 

[[Ps.129.1|1]] Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:

1: 

[[Ps.129.2|2]] Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.

2: 

[[Ps.129.3|3]] The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.

3: 

[[Ps.129.4|4]] The LORD \[is\] righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.

4: 

[[Ps.129.5|5]] Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.

5: 

[[Ps.129.6|6]] Let them be as the grass \[upon\] the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:

6: 

[[Ps.129.7|7]] Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.

7: 

[[Ps.129.8|8]] Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD \[be\] upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.

8:
