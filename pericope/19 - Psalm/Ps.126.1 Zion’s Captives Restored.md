[[Ps.126|Psalm 126:1 - Psalm 126:6]]
*Zion’s Captives Restored*

[[Ps.126.0|0]] A Song of degrees.

0: 

[[Ps.126.1|1]] When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.

1: 

[[Ps.126.2|2]] Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.

2: 

[[Ps.126.3|3]] The LORD hath done great things for us; \[whereof\] we are glad.

3: 

[[Ps.126.4|4]] Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.

4: 

[[Ps.126.5|5]] They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

5: 

[[Ps.126.6|6]] He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves \[with him\].
