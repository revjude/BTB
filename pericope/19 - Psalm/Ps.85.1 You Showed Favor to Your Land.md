[[Ps.85|Psalm 85:1 - Psalm 85:13]]
*You Showed Favor to Your Land*

[[Ps.85.0|0]] To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.

0: 

[[Ps.85.1|1]] LORD, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.

1: 

[[Ps.85.2|2]] Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.

2: 

[[Ps.85.3|3]] Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned \[thyself\] from the fierceness of thine anger.

3: 

[[Ps.85.4|4]] Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.

4: 

[[Ps.85.5|5]] Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?

5: 

[[Ps.85.6|6]] Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?

6: 

[[Ps.85.7|7]] Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.

7: 

[[Ps.85.8|8]] I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.

8: 

[[Ps.85.9|9]] Surely his salvation \[is\] nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.

9: 

[[Ps.85.10|10]] Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed \[each other\].

10: 

[[Ps.85.11|11]] Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.

11: 

[[Ps.85.12|12]] Yea, the LORD shall give \[that which is\] good; and our land shall yield her increase.

12: 

[[Ps.85.13|13]] Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set \[us\] in the way of his steps.

13:
