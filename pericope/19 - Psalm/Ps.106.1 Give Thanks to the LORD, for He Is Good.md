[[Ps.106|Psalm 106:1 - Psalm 106:48]]
*Give Thanks to the LORD, for He Is Good*

[[Ps.106.1|1]] Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for \[he is\] good: for his mercy \[endureth\] for ever.

1: 

[[Ps.106.2|2]] Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? \[who\] can shew forth all his praise?

2: 

[[Ps.106.3|3]] Blessed \[are\] they that keep judgment, \[and\] he that doeth righteousness at all times.

3: 

[[Ps.106.4|4]] Remember me, O LORD, with the favour \[that thou bearest unto\] thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;

4: 

[[Ps.106.5|5]] That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.

5: 

[[Ps.106.6|6]] We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.

6: 

[[Ps.106.7|7]] Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked \[him\] at the sea, \[even\] at the Red sea.

7: 

[[Ps.106.8|8]] Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.

8: 

[[Ps.106.9|9]] He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.

9: 

[[Ps.106.10|10]] And he saved them from the hand of him that hated \[them\], and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

10: 

[[Ps.106.11|11]] And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.

11: 

[[Ps.106.12|12]] Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.

12: 

[[Ps.106.13|13]] They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:

13: 

[[Ps.106.14|14]] But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.

14: 

[[Ps.106.15|15]] And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.

15: 

[[Ps.106.16|16]] They envied Moses also in the camp, \[and\] Aaron the saint of the LORD.

16: 

[[Ps.106.17|17]] The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.

17: 

[[Ps.106.18|18]] And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.

18: 

[[Ps.106.19|19]] They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.

19: 

[[Ps.106.20|20]] Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.

20: 

[[Ps.106.21|21]] They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;

21: 

[[Ps.106.22|22]] Wondrous works in the land of Ham, \[and\] terrible things by the Red sea.

22: 

[[Ps.106.23|23]] Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy \[them\].

23: 

[[Ps.106.24|24]] Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:

24: 

[[Ps.106.25|25]] But murmured in their tents, \[and\] hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.

25: 

[[Ps.106.26|26]] Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:

26: 

[[Ps.106.27|27]] To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.

27: 

[[Ps.106.28|28]] They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.

28: 

[[Ps.106.29|29]] Thus they provoked \[him\] to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.

29: 

[[Ps.106.30|30]] Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and \[so\] the plague was stayed.

30: 

[[Ps.106.31|31]] And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.

31: 

[[Ps.106.32|32]] They angered \[him\] also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:

32: 

[[Ps.106.33|33]] Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.

33: 

[[Ps.106.34|34]] They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:

34: 

[[Ps.106.35|35]] But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.

35: 

[[Ps.106.36|36]] And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.

36: 

[[Ps.106.37|37]] Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,

37: 

[[Ps.106.38|38]] And shed innocent blood, \[even\] the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.

38: 

[[Ps.106.39|39]] Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.

39: 

[[Ps.106.40|40]] Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.

40: 

[[Ps.106.41|41]] And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.

41: 

[[Ps.106.42|42]] Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.

42: 

[[Ps.106.43|43]] Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked \[him\] with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.

43: 

[[Ps.106.44|44]] Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:

44: 

[[Ps.106.45|45]] And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.

45: 

[[Ps.106.46|46]] He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.

46: 

[[Ps.106.47|47]] Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, \[and\] to triumph in thy praise.

47: 

[[Ps.106.48|48]] Blessed \[be\] the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.

48:
