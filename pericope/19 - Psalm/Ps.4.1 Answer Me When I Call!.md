[[Ps.4|Psalm 4:1 - Psalm 4:8]]
*Answer Me When I Call!*

[[Ps.4.0|0]] To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David.

0: 

[[Ps.4.1|1]] Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me \[when I was\] in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.

1: 

[[Ps.4.2|2]] O ye sons of men, how long \[will ye turn\] my glory into shame? \[how long\] will ye love vanity, \[and\] seek after leasing? Selah.

2: 

[[Ps.4.3|3]] But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.

3: 

[[Ps.4.4|4]] Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.

4: 

[[Ps.4.5|5]] Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.

5: 

[[Ps.4.6|6]] \[There be\] many that say, Who will shew us \[any\] good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.

6: 

[[Ps.4.7|7]] Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time \[that\] their corn and their wine increased.

7: 

[[Ps.4.8|8]] I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.

8:
