[[Ps.109|Psalm 109:1 - Psalm 109:31]]
*The Song of the Slandered*

[[Ps.109.0|0]] To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

0: 

[[Ps.109.1|1]] Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;

1: 

[[Ps.109.2|2]] For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.

2: 

[[Ps.109.3|3]] They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.

3: 

[[Ps.109.4|4]] For my love they are my adversaries: but I \[give myself unto\] prayer.

4: 

[[Ps.109.5|5]] And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.

5: 

[[Ps.109.6|6]] Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.

6: 

[[Ps.109.7|7]] When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.

7: 

[[Ps.109.8|8]] Let his days be few; \[and\] let another take his office.

8: 

[[Ps.109.9|9]] Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.

9: 

[[Ps.109.10|10]] Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek \[their bread\] also out of their desolate places.

10: 

[[Ps.109.11|11]] Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.

11: 

[[Ps.109.12|12]] Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.

12: 

[[Ps.109.13|13]] Let his posterity be cut off; \[and\] in the generation following let their name be blotted out.

13: 

[[Ps.109.14|14]] Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

14: 

[[Ps.109.15|15]] Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.

15: 

[[Ps.109.16|16]] Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.

16: 

[[Ps.109.17|17]] As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.

17: 

[[Ps.109.18|18]] As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.

18: 

[[Ps.109.19|19]] Let it be unto him as the garment \[which\] covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.

19: 

[[Ps.109.20|20]] \[Let\] this \[be\] the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.

20: 

[[Ps.109.21|21]] But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name’s sake: because thy mercy \[is\] good, deliver thou me.

21: 

[[Ps.109.22|22]] For I \[am\] poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.

22: 

[[Ps.109.23|23]] I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.

23: 

[[Ps.109.24|24]] My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.

24: 

[[Ps.109.25|25]] I became also a reproach unto them: \[when\] they looked upon me they shaked their heads.

25: 

[[Ps.109.26|26]] Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:

26: 

[[Ps.109.27|27]] That they may know that this \[is\] thy hand; \[that\] thou, LORD, hast done it.

27: 

[[Ps.109.28|28]] Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.

28: 

[[Ps.109.29|29]] Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.

29: 

[[Ps.109.30|30]] I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.

30: 

[[Ps.109.31|31]] For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save \[him\] from those that condemn his soul.

31:
