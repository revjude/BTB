[[Ps.23.1|1]] The LORD \[is\] my shepherd; I shall not want.

[[Ps.23.2|2]] He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.

[[Ps.23.3|3]] He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.

3: 

[[Ps.23.4|4]] Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou \[art\] with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

6:
