[[Ps.81|Psalm 81:1 - Psalm 81:16]]
*Sing for Joy to God Our Strength*

[[Ps.81.0|0]] To the chief Musician upon Gittith, \[A Psalm\] of Asaph.

0: 

[[Ps.81.1|1]] Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.

1: 

[[Ps.81.2|2]] Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.

2: 

[[Ps.81.3|3]] Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.

3: 

[[Ps.81.4|4]] For this \[was\] a statute for Israel, \[and\] a law of the God of Jacob.

4: 

[[Ps.81.5|5]] This he ordained in Joseph \[for\] a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: \[where\] I heard a language \[that\] I understood not.

5: 

[[Ps.81.6|6]] I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.

6: 

[[Ps.81.7|7]] Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.

7: 

[[Ps.81.8|8]] Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;

8: 

[[Ps.81.9|9]] There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.

9: 

[[Ps.81.10|10]] I \[am\] the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.

10: 

[[Ps.81.11|11]] But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.

11: 

[[Ps.81.12|12]] So I gave them up unto their own hearts’ lust: \[and\] they walked in their own counsels.

12: 

[[Ps.81.13|13]] Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, \[and\] Israel had walked in my ways!

13: 

[[Ps.81.14|14]] I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.

14: 

[[Ps.81.15|15]] The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.

15: 

[[Ps.81.16|16]] He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.

16:
