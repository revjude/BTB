[[Ps.38|Psalm 38:1 - Psalm 38:22]]
*Do Not Rebuke Me in Your Anger*

[[Ps.38.0|0]] A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.

0: 

[[Ps.38.1|1]] O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.

1: 

[[Ps.38.2|2]] For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.

2: 

[[Ps.38.3|3]] \[There is\] no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither \[is there any\] rest in my bones because of my sin.

3: 

[[Ps.38.4|4]] For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.

4: 

[[Ps.38.5|5]] My wounds stink \[and\] are corrupt because of my foolishness.

5: 

[[Ps.38.6|6]] I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.

6: 

[[Ps.38.7|7]] For my loins are filled with a loathsome \[disease\]: and \[there is\] no soundness in my flesh.

7: 

[[Ps.38.8|8]] I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.

8: 

[[Ps.38.9|9]] Lord, all my desire \[is\] before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.

9: 

[[Ps.38.10|10]] My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.

10: 

[[Ps.38.11|11]] My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.

11: 

[[Ps.38.12|12]] They also that seek after my life lay snares \[for me\]: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.

12: 

[[Ps.38.13|13]] But I, as a deaf \[man\], heard not; and \[I was\] as a dumb man \[that\] openeth not his mouth.

13: 

[[Ps.38.14|14]] Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth \[are\] no reproofs.

14: 

[[Ps.38.15|15]] For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.

15: 

[[Ps.38.16|16]] For I said, \[Hear me\], lest \[otherwise\] they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify \[themselves\] against me.

16: 

[[Ps.38.17|17]] For I \[am\] ready to halt, and my sorrow \[is\] continually before me.

17: 

[[Ps.38.18|18]] For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.

18: 

[[Ps.38.19|19]] But mine enemies \[are\] lively, \[and\] they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.

19: 

[[Ps.38.20|20]] They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow \[the thing that\] good \[is\].

20: 

[[Ps.38.21|21]] Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.

21: 

[[Ps.38.22|22]] Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.

22:
