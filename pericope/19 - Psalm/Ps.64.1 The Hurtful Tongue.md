[[Ps.64|Psalm 64:1 - Psalm 64:10]]
*The Hurtful Tongue*

[[Ps.64.0|0]] To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

0: 

[[Ps.64.1|1]] Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.

1: 

[[Ps.64.2|2]] Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:

2: 

[[Ps.64.3|3]] Who whet their tongue like a sword, \[and\] bend \[their bows to shoot\] their arrows, \[even\] bitter words:

3: 

[[Ps.64.4|4]] That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.

4: 

[[Ps.64.5|5]] They encourage themselves \[in\] an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?

5: 

[[Ps.64.6|6]] They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward \[thought\] of every one \[of them\], and the heart, \[is\] deep.

6: 

[[Ps.64.7|7]] But God shall shoot at them \[with\] an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.

7: 

[[Ps.64.8|8]] So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.

8: 

[[Ps.64.9|9]] And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.

9: 

[[Ps.64.10|10]] The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.

10:
