[[Ps.37|Psalm 37:1 - Psalm 37:40]]
*Delight Yourself in the LORD*

[[Ps.37.0|0]] \[A Psalm\] of David.

0: 

[[Ps.37.1|1]] Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.

1: 

[[Ps.37.2|2]] For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.

2: 

[[Ps.37.3|3]] Trust in the LORD, and do good; \[so\] shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.

3: 

[[Ps.37.4|4]] Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.

4: 

[[Ps.37.5|5]] Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring \[it\] to pass.

5: 

[[Ps.37.6|6]] And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.

6: 

[[Ps.37.7|7]] Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.

7: 

[[Ps.37.8|8]] Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.

8: 

[[Ps.37.9|9]] For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.

9: 

[[Ps.37.10|10]] For yet a little while, and the wicked \[shall\] not \[be\]: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it \[shall\] not \[be\].

10: 

[[Ps.37.11|11]] But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.

11: 

[[Ps.37.12|12]] The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.

12: 

[[Ps.37.13|13]] The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.

13: 

[[Ps.37.14|14]] The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, \[and\] to slay such as be of upright conversation.

14: 

[[Ps.37.15|15]] Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.

15: 

[[Ps.37.16|16]] A little that a righteous man hath \[is\] better than the riches of many wicked.

16: 

[[Ps.37.17|17]] For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.

17: 

[[Ps.37.18|18]] The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.

18: 

[[Ps.37.19|19]] They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.

19: 

[[Ps.37.20|20]] But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD \[shall be\] as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.

20: 

[[Ps.37.21|21]] The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.

21: 

[[Ps.37.22|22]] For \[such as be\] blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and \[they that be\] cursed of him shall be cut off.

22: 

[[Ps.37.23|23]] The steps of a \[good\] man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.

23: 

[[Ps.37.24|24]] Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth \[him with\] his hand.

24: 

[[Ps.37.25|25]] I have been young, and \[now\] am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.

25: 

[[Ps.37.26|26]] \[He is\] ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed \[is\] blessed.

26: 

[[Ps.37.27|27]] Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.

27: 

[[Ps.37.28|28]] For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.

28: 

[[Ps.37.29|29]] The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.

29: 

[[Ps.37.30|30]] The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.

30: 

[[Ps.37.31|31]] The law of his God \[is\] in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.

31: 

[[Ps.37.32|32]] The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.

32: 

[[Ps.37.33|33]] The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.

33: 

[[Ps.37.34|34]] Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see \[it\].

34: 

[[Ps.37.35|35]] I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.

35: 

[[Ps.37.36|36]] Yet he passed away, and, lo, he \[was\] not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.

36: 

[[Ps.37.37|37]] Mark the perfect \[man\], and behold the upright: for the end of \[that\] man \[is\] peace.

37: 

[[Ps.37.38|38]] But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.

38: 

[[Ps.37.39|39]] But the salvation of the righteous \[is\] of the LORD: \[he is\] their strength in the time of trouble.

39: 

[[Ps.37.40|40]] And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.

40:
