[[Ps.116|Psalm 116:1 - Psalm 116:19]]
*The LORD Has Heard My Voice*

[[Ps.116.1|1]] I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice \[and\] my supplications.

1: 

[[Ps.116.2|2]] Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon \[him\] as long as I live.

2: 

[[Ps.116.3|3]] The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.

3: 

[[Ps.116.4|4]] Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.

4: 

[[Ps.116.5|5]] Gracious \[is\] the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God \[is\] merciful.

5: 

[[Ps.116.6|6]] The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.

6: 

[[Ps.116.7|7]] Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.

7: 

[[Ps.116.8|8]] For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, \[and\] my feet from falling.

8: 

[[Ps.116.9|9]] I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.

9: 

[[Ps.116.10|10]] I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:

10: 

[[Ps.116.11|11]] I said in my haste, All men \[are\] liars.

11: 

[[Ps.116.12|12]] What shall I render unto the LORD \[for\] all his benefits toward me?

12: 

[[Ps.116.13|13]] I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.

13: 

[[Ps.116.14|14]] I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.

14: 

[[Ps.116.15|15]] Precious in the sight of the LORD \[is\] the death of his saints.

15: 

[[Ps.116.16|16]] O LORD, truly I \[am\] thy servant; I \[am\] thy servant, \[and\] the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.

16: 

[[Ps.116.17|17]] I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD.

17: 

[[Ps.116.18|18]] I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people,

18: 

[[Ps.116.19|19]] In the courts of the LORD’S house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.

19:
