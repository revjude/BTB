[[Ps.89|Psalm 89:1 - Psalm 89:52]]
*I Will Sing of His Love Forever*

[[Ps.89.0|0]] Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite.

0: 

[[Ps.89.1|1]] I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.

1: 

[[Ps.89.2|2]] For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.

2: 

[[Ps.89.3|3]] I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,

3: 

[[Ps.89.4|4]] Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.

4: 

[[Ps.89.5|5]] And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.

5: 

[[Ps.89.6|6]] For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? \[who\] among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?

6: 

[[Ps.89.7|7]] God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all \[them that are\] about him.

7: 

[[Ps.89.8|8]] O LORD God of hosts, who \[is\] a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?

8: 

[[Ps.89.9|9]] Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.

9: 

[[Ps.89.10|10]] Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.

10: 

[[Ps.89.11|11]] The heavens \[are\] thine, the earth also \[is\] thine: \[as for\] the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.

11: 

[[Ps.89.12|12]] The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.

12: 

[[Ps.89.13|13]] Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, \[and\] high is thy right hand.

13: 

[[Ps.89.14|14]] Justice and judgment \[are\] the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.

14: 

[[Ps.89.15|15]] Blessed \[is\] the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.

15: 

[[Ps.89.16|16]] In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.

16: 

[[Ps.89.17|17]] For thou \[art\] the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.

17: 

[[Ps.89.18|18]] For the LORD \[is\] our defence; and the Holy One of Israel \[is\] our king.

18: 

[[Ps.89.19|19]] Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon \[one that is\] mighty; I have exalted \[one\] chosen out of the people.

19: 

[[Ps.89.20|20]] I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:

20: 

[[Ps.89.21|21]] With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.

21: 

[[Ps.89.22|22]] The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.

22: 

[[Ps.89.23|23]] And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.

23: 

[[Ps.89.24|24]] But my faithfulness and my mercy \[shall be\] with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.

24: 

[[Ps.89.25|25]] I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.

25: 

[[Ps.89.26|26]] He shall cry unto me, Thou \[art\] my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.

26: 

[[Ps.89.27|27]] Also I will make him \[my\] firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.

27: 

[[Ps.89.28|28]] My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.

28: 

[[Ps.89.29|29]] His seed also will I make \[to endure\] for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.

29: 

[[Ps.89.30|30]] If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;

30: 

[[Ps.89.31|31]] If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;

31: 

[[Ps.89.32|32]] Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.

32: 

[[Ps.89.33|33]] Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.

33: 

[[Ps.89.34|34]] My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.

34: 

[[Ps.89.35|35]] Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.

35: 

[[Ps.89.36|36]] His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.

36: 

[[Ps.89.37|37]] It shall be established for ever as the moon, and \[as\] a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.

37: 

[[Ps.89.38|38]] But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.

38: 

[[Ps.89.39|39]] Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown \[by casting it\] to the ground.

39: 

[[Ps.89.40|40]] Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.

40: 

[[Ps.89.41|41]] All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.

41: 

[[Ps.89.42|42]] Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.

42: 

[[Ps.89.43|43]] Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.

43: 

[[Ps.89.44|44]] Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.

44: 

[[Ps.89.45|45]] The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.

45: 

[[Ps.89.46|46]] How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?

46: 

[[Ps.89.47|47]] Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?

47: 

[[Ps.89.48|48]] What man \[is he that\] liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.

48: 

[[Ps.89.49|49]] Lord, where \[are\] thy former lovingkindnesses, \[which\] thou swarest unto David in thy truth?

49: 

[[Ps.89.50|50]] Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; \[how\] I do bear in my bosom \[the reproach of\] all the mighty people;

50: 

[[Ps.89.51|51]] Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.

51: 

[[Ps.89.52|52]] Blessed \[be\] the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

52:
