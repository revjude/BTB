[[Ps.139|Psalm 139:1 - Psalm 139:24]]
*You Have Searched Me and Known Me*

[[Ps.139.0|0]] To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

0: 

[[Ps.139.1|1]] O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known \[me\].

1: 

[[Ps.139.2|2]] Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.

2: 

[[Ps.139.3|3]] Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted \[with\] all my ways.

3: 

[[Ps.139.4|4]] For \[there is\] not a word in my tongue, \[but\], lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.

4: 

[[Ps.139.5|5]] Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.

5: 

[[Ps.139.6|6]] \[Such\] knowledge \[is\] too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot \[attain\] unto it.

6: 

[[Ps.139.7|7]] Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?

7: 

[[Ps.139.8|8]] If I ascend up into heaven, thou \[art\] there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou \[art there\].

8: 

[[Ps.139.9|9]] \[If\] I take the wings of the morning, \[and\] dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;

9: 

[[Ps.139.10|10]] Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.

10: 

[[Ps.139.11|11]] If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.

11: 

[[Ps.139.12|12]] Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light \[are\] both alike \[to thee\].

12: 

[[Ps.139.13|13]] For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother’s womb.

13: 

[[Ps.139.14|14]] I will praise thee; for I am fearfully \[and\] wonderfully made: marvellous \[are\] thy works; and \[that\] my soul knoweth right well.

14: 

[[Ps.139.15|15]] My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, \[and\] curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.

15: 

[[Ps.139.16|16]] Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all \[my members\] were written, \[which\] in continuance were fashioned, when \[as yet there was\] none of them.

16: 

[[Ps.139.17|17]] How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!

17: 

[[Ps.139.18|18]] \[If\] I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.

18: 

[[Ps.139.19|19]] Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.

19: 

[[Ps.139.20|20]] For they speak against thee wickedly, \[and\] thine enemies take \[thy name\] in vain.

20: 

[[Ps.139.21|21]] Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?

21: 

[[Ps.139.22|22]] I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.

22: 

[[Ps.139.23|23]] Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:

23: 

[[Ps.139.24|24]] And see if \[there be any\] wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.

24:
