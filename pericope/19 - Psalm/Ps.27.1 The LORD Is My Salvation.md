[[Ps.27|Psalm 27:1 - Psalm 27:14]]
*The LORD Is My Salvation*

[[Ps.27.0|0]] \[A Psalm\] of David.

0: 

[[Ps.27.1|1]] The LORD \[is\] my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD \[is\] the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

1: 

[[Ps.27.2|2]] When the wicked, \[even\] mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.

2: 

[[Ps.27.3|3]] Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this \[will\] I \[be\] confident.

3: 

[[Ps.27.4|4]] One \[thing\] have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to inquire in his temple.

4: 

[[Ps.27.5|5]] For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.

5: 

[[Ps.27.6|6]] And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.

6: 

[[Ps.27.7|7]] Hear, O LORD, \[when\] I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.

7: 

[[Ps.27.8|8]] \[When thou saidst\], Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.

8: 

[[Ps.27.9|9]] Hide not thy face \[far\] from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.

9: 

[[Ps.27.10|10]] When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up.

10: 

[[Ps.27.11|11]] Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.

11: 

[[Ps.27.12|12]] Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.

12: 

[[Ps.27.13|13]] \[I had fainted\], unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.

13: 

[[Ps.27.14|14]] Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.

14:
