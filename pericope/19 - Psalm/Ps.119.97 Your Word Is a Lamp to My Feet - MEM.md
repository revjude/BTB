*Your Word Is a Lamp to My Feet - MEM*

[[Ps.119.97|97]] O how love I thy law! it \[is\] my meditation all the day.

97: 

[[Ps.119.98|98]] Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they \[are\] ever with me.

98: 

[[Ps.119.99|99]] I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies \[are\] my meditation.

99: 

[[Ps.119.100|100]] I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.

100: 

[[Ps.119.101|101]] I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.

101: 

[[Ps.119.102|102]] I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.

102: 

[[Ps.119.103|103]] How sweet are thy words unto my taste! \[yea, sweeter\] than honey to my mouth!

103: 

[[Ps.119.104|104]] Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.

104:
