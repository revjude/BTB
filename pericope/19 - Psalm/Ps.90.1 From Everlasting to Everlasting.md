[[Ps.90|Psalm 90:1 - Psalm 90:17]]
*From Everlasting to Everlasting*

[[Ps.90.0|0]] A Prayer of Moses the man of God.

0: 

[[Ps.90.1|1]] Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.

1: 

[[Ps.90.2|2]] Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou \[art\] God.

2: 

[[Ps.90.3|3]] Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.

3: 

[[Ps.90.4|4]] For a thousand years in thy sight \[are but\] as yesterday when it is past, and \[as\] a watch in the night.

4: 

[[Ps.90.5|5]] Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are \[as\] a sleep: in the morning \[they are\] like grass \[which\] groweth up.

5: 

[[Ps.90.6|6]] In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.

6: 

[[Ps.90.7|7]] For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.

7: 

[[Ps.90.8|8]] Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret \[sins\] in the light of thy countenance.

8: 

[[Ps.90.9|9]] For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale \[that is told\].

9: 

[[Ps.90.10|10]] The days of our years \[are\] threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength \[they be\] fourscore years, yet \[is\] their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.

10: 

[[Ps.90.11|11]] Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, \[so is\] thy wrath.

11: 

[[Ps.90.12|12]] So teach \[us\] to number our days, that we may apply \[our\] hearts unto wisdom.

12: 

[[Ps.90.13|13]] Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.

13: 

[[Ps.90.14|14]] O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.

14: 

[[Ps.90.15|15]] Make us glad according to the days \[wherein\] thou hast afflicted us, \[and\] the years \[wherein\] we have seen evil.

15: 

[[Ps.90.16|16]] Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.

16: 

[[Ps.90.17|17]] And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.

17:
