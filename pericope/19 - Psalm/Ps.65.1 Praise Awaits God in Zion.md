[[Ps.65|Psalm 65:1 - Psalm 65:13]]
*Praise Awaits God in Zion*

[[Ps.65.0|0]] To the chief Musician, A Psalm \[and\] Song of David.

0: 

[[Ps.65.1|1]] Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed.

1: 

[[Ps.65.2|2]] O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.

2: 

[[Ps.65.3|3]] Iniquities prevail against me: \[as for\] our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.

3: 

[[Ps.65.4|4]] Blessed \[is the man whom\] thou choosest, and causest to approach \[unto thee, that\] he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, \[even\] of thy holy temple.

4: 

[[Ps.65.5|5]] \[By\] terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; \[who art\] the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off \[upon\] the sea:

5: 

[[Ps.65.6|6]] Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; \[being\] girded with power:

6: 

[[Ps.65.7|7]] Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.

7: 

[[Ps.65.8|8]] They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.

8: 

[[Ps.65.9|9]] Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, \[which\] is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.

9: 

[[Ps.65.10|10]] Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.

10: 

[[Ps.65.11|11]] Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.

11: 

[[Ps.65.12|12]] They drop \[upon\] the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.

12: 

[[Ps.65.13|13]] The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.

13:
