[[Ps.92|Psalm 92:1 - Psalm 92:15]]
*How Great Are Your Works!*

[[Ps.92.0|0]] A Psalm \[or\] Song for the sabbath day.

0: 

[[Ps.92.1|1]] \[It is a\] good \[thing\] to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:

1: 

[[Ps.92.2|2]] To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,

2: 

[[Ps.92.3|3]] Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.

3: 

[[Ps.92.4|4]] For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.

4: 

[[Ps.92.5|5]] O LORD, how great are thy works! \[and\] thy thoughts are very deep.

5: 

[[Ps.92.6|6]] A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.

6: 

[[Ps.92.7|7]] When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; \[it is\] that they shall be destroyed for ever:

7: 

[[Ps.92.8|8]] But thou, LORD, \[art most\] high for evermore.

8: 

[[Ps.92.9|9]] For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

9: 

[[Ps.92.10|10]] But my horn shalt thou exalt like \[the horn of\] an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.

10: 

[[Ps.92.11|11]] Mine eye also shall see \[my desire\] on mine enemies, \[and\] mine ears shall hear \[my desire\] of the wicked that rise up against me.

11: 

[[Ps.92.12|12]] The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.

12: 

[[Ps.92.13|13]] Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.

13: 

[[Ps.92.14|14]] They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;

14: 

[[Ps.92.15|15]] To shew that the LORD \[is\] upright: \[he is\] my rock, and \[there is\] no unrighteousness in him.

15:
