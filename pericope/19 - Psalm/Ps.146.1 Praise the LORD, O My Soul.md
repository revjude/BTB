[[Ps.146|Psalm 146:1 - Psalm 146:10]]
*Praise the LORD, O My Soul*

[[Ps.146.1|1]] Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.

1: 

[[Ps.146.2|2]] While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.

2: 

[[Ps.146.3|3]] Put not your trust in princes, \[nor\] in the son of man, in whom \[there is\] no help.

3: 

[[Ps.146.4|4]] His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.

4: 

[[Ps.146.5|5]] Happy \[is he\] that \[hath\] the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope \[is\] in the LORD his God:

5: 

[[Ps.146.6|6]] Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein \[is\]: which keepeth truth for ever:

6: 

[[Ps.146.7|7]] Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:

7: 

[[Ps.146.8|8]] The LORD openeth \[the eyes of\] the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:

8: 

[[Ps.146.9|9]] The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.

9: 

[[Ps.146.10|10]] The LORD shall reign for ever, \[even\] thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the LORD.

10:
