[[Ps.35|Psalm 35:1 - Psalm 35:28]]
*Contend with My Opponents, O LORD*

[[Ps.35.0|0]] \[A Psalm\] of David.

0: 

[[Ps.35.1|1]] Plead \[my cause\], O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.

1: 

[[Ps.35.2|2]] Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.

2: 

[[Ps.35.3|3]] Draw out also the spear, and stop \[the way\] against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I \[am\] thy salvation.

3: 

[[Ps.35.4|4]] Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.

4: 

[[Ps.35.5|5]] Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase \[them\].

5: 

[[Ps.35.6|6]] Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them.

6: 

[[Ps.35.7|7]] For without cause have they hid for me their net \[in\] a pit, \[which\] without cause they have digged for my soul.

7: 

[[Ps.35.8|8]] Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.

8: 

[[Ps.35.9|9]] And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation.

9: 

[[Ps.35.10|10]] All my bones shall say, LORD, who \[is\] like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?

10: 

[[Ps.35.11|11]] False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge \[things\] that I knew not.

11: 

[[Ps.35.12|12]] They rewarded me evil for good \[to\] the spoiling of my soul.

12: 

[[Ps.35.13|13]] But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing \[was\] sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.

13: 

[[Ps.35.14|14]] I behaved myself as though \[he had been\] my friend \[or\] brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth \[for his\] mother.

14: 

[[Ps.35.15|15]] But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: \[yea\], the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew \[it\] not; they did tear \[me\], and ceased not:

15: 

[[Ps.35.16|16]] With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.

16: 

[[Ps.35.17|17]] Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.

17: 

[[Ps.35.18|18]] I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.

18: 

[[Ps.35.19|19]] Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: \[neither\] let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.

19: 

[[Ps.35.20|20]] For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against \[them that are\] quiet in the land.

20: 

[[Ps.35.21|21]] Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, \[and\] said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen \[it\].

21: 

[[Ps.35.22|22]] \[This\] thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.

22: 

[[Ps.35.23|23]] Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, \[even\] unto my cause, my God and my Lord.

23: 

[[Ps.35.24|24]] Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.

24: 

[[Ps.35.25|25]] Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.

25: 

[[Ps.35.26|26]] Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify \[themselves\] against me.

26: 

[[Ps.35.27|27]] Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.

27: 

[[Ps.35.28|28]] And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness \[and\] of thy praise all the day long.

28:
