[[Ps.99|Psalm 99:1 - Psalm 99:9]]
*The LORD Reigns!*

[[Ps.99.1|1]] The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth \[between\] the cherubims; let the earth be moved.

1: 

[[Ps.99.2|2]] The LORD \[is\] great in Zion; and he \[is\] high above all the people.

2: 

[[Ps.99.3|3]] Let them praise thy great and terrible name; \[for\] it \[is\] holy.

3: 

[[Ps.99.4|4]] The king’s strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.

4: 

[[Ps.99.5|5]] Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; \[for\] he \[is\] holy.

5: 

[[Ps.99.6|6]] Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.

6: 

[[Ps.99.7|7]] He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance \[that\] he gave them.

7: 

[[Ps.99.8|8]] Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.

8: 

[[Ps.99.9|9]] Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God \[is\] holy.

9:
