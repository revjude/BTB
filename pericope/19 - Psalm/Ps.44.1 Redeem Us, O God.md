[[Ps.44|Psalm 44:1 - Psalm 44:26]]
*Redeem Us, O God*

[[Ps.44.0|0]] To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, Maschil.

0: 

[[Ps.44.1|1]] We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, \[what\] work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.

1: 

[[Ps.44.2|2]] \[How\] thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; \[how\] thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.

2: 

[[Ps.44.3|3]] For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.

3: 

[[Ps.44.4|4]] Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.

4: 

[[Ps.44.5|5]] Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.

5: 

[[Ps.44.6|6]] For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.

6: 

[[Ps.44.7|7]] But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.

7: 

[[Ps.44.8|8]] In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.

8: 

[[Ps.44.9|9]] But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.

9: 

[[Ps.44.10|10]] Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.

10: 

[[Ps.44.11|11]] Thou hast given us like sheep \[appointed\] for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.

11: 

[[Ps.44.12|12]] Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase \[thy wealth\] by their price.

12: 

[[Ps.44.13|13]] Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.

13: 

[[Ps.44.14|14]] Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.

14: 

[[Ps.44.15|15]] My confusion \[is\] continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,

15: 

[[Ps.44.16|16]] For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.

16: 

[[Ps.44.17|17]] All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.

17: 

[[Ps.44.18|18]] Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;

18: 

[[Ps.44.19|19]] Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.

19: 

[[Ps.44.20|20]] If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;

20: 

[[Ps.44.21|21]] Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.

21: 

[[Ps.44.22|22]] Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.

22: 

[[Ps.44.23|23]] Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast \[us\] not off for ever.

23: 

[[Ps.44.24|24]] Wherefore hidest thou thy face, \[and\] forgettest our affliction and our oppression?

24: 

[[Ps.44.25|25]] For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.

25: 

[[Ps.44.26|26]] Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies’ sake.

26:
