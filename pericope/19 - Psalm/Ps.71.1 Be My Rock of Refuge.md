[[Ps.71|Psalm 71:1 - Psalm 71:24]]
*Be My Rock of Refuge*

[[Ps.71.1|1]] In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.

1: 

[[Ps.71.2|2]] Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.

2: 

[[Ps.71.3|3]] Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou \[art\] my rock and my fortress.

3: 

[[Ps.71.4|4]] Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

4: 

[[Ps.71.5|5]] For thou \[art\] my hope, O Lord GOD: \[thou art\] my trust from my youth.

5: 

[[Ps.71.6|6]] By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother’s bowels: my praise \[shall be\] continually of thee.

6: 

[[Ps.71.7|7]] I am as a wonder unto many; but thou \[art\] my strong refuge.

7: 

[[Ps.71.8|8]] Let my mouth be filled \[with\] thy praise \[and with\] thy honour all the day.

8: 

[[Ps.71.9|9]] Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.

9: 

[[Ps.71.10|10]] For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,

10: 

[[Ps.71.11|11]] Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for \[there is\] none to deliver \[him\].

11: 

[[Ps.71.12|12]] O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.

12: 

[[Ps.71.13|13]] Let them be confounded \[and\] consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered \[with\] reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.

13: 

[[Ps.71.14|14]] But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.

14: 

[[Ps.71.15|15]] My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness \[and\] thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers \[thereof\].

15: 

[[Ps.71.16|16]] I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, \[even\] of thine only.

16: 

[[Ps.71.17|17]] O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.

17: 

[[Ps.71.18|18]] Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto \[this\] generation, \[and\] thy power to every one \[that\] is to come.

18: 

[[Ps.71.19|19]] Thy righteousness also, O God, \[is\] very high, who hast done great things: O God, who \[is\] like unto thee!

19: 

[[Ps.71.20|20]] \[Thou\], which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.

20: 

[[Ps.71.21|21]] Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.

21: 

[[Ps.71.22|22]] I will also praise thee with the psaltery, \[even\] thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.

22: 

[[Ps.71.23|23]] My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.

23: 

[[Ps.71.24|24]] My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.

24:
