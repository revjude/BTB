[[Ps.94|Psalm 94:1 - Psalm 94:23]]
*The LORD Will Not Forget His People*

[[Ps.94.1|1]] O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.

1: 

[[Ps.94.2|2]] Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.

2: 

[[Ps.94.3|3]] LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?

3: 

[[Ps.94.4|4]] \[How long\] shall they utter \[and\] speak hard things? \[and\] all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?

4: 

[[Ps.94.5|5]] They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.

5: 

[[Ps.94.6|6]] They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.

6: 

[[Ps.94.7|7]] Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard \[it\].

7: 

[[Ps.94.8|8]] Understand, ye brutish among the people: and \[ye\] fools, when will ye be wise?

8: 

[[Ps.94.9|9]] He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?

9: 

[[Ps.94.10|10]] He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, \[shall not he know\]?

10: 

[[Ps.94.11|11]] The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they \[are\] vanity.

11: 

[[Ps.94.12|12]] Blessed \[is\] the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;

12: 

[[Ps.94.13|13]] That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.

13: 

[[Ps.94.14|14]] For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.

14: 

[[Ps.94.15|15]] But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.

15: 

[[Ps.94.16|16]] Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? \[or\] who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?

16: 

[[Ps.94.17|17]] Unless the LORD \[had been\] my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.

17: 

[[Ps.94.18|18]] When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.

18: 

[[Ps.94.19|19]] In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.

19: 

[[Ps.94.20|20]] Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?

20: 

[[Ps.94.21|21]] They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.

21: 

[[Ps.94.22|22]] But the LORD is my defence; and my God \[is\] the rock of my refuge.

22: 

[[Ps.94.23|23]] And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; \[yea\], the LORD our God shall cut them off.

23:
