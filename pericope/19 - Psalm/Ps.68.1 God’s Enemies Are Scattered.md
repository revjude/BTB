[[Ps.68|Psalm 68:1 - Psalm 68:35]]
*God’s Enemies Are Scattered*

[[Ps.68.0|0]] To the chief Musician, A Psalm \[or\] Song of David.

0: 

[[Ps.68.1|1]] Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.

1: 

[[Ps.68.2|2]] As smoke is driven away, \[so\] drive \[them\] away: as wax melteth before the fire, \[so\] let the wicked perish at the presence of God.

2: 

[[Ps.68.3|3]] But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.

3: 

[[Ps.68.4|4]] Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.

4: 

[[Ps.68.5|5]] A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, \[is\] God in his holy habitation.

5: 

[[Ps.68.6|6]] God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry \[land\].

6: 

[[Ps.68.7|7]] O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah:

7: 

[[Ps.68.8|8]] The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: \[even\] Sinai itself \[was moved\] at the presence of God, the God of Israel.

8: 

[[Ps.68.9|9]] Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.

9: 

[[Ps.68.10|10]] Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor.

10: 

[[Ps.68.11|11]] The Lord gave the word: great \[was\] the company of those that published \[it\].

11: 

[[Ps.68.12|12]] Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.

12: 

[[Ps.68.13|13]] Though ye have lien among the pots, \[yet shall ye be as\] the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.

13: 

[[Ps.68.14|14]] When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was \[white\] as snow in Salmon.

14: 

[[Ps.68.15|15]] The hill of God \[is as\] the hill of Bashan; an high hill \[as\] the hill of Bashan.

15: 

[[Ps.68.16|16]] Why leap ye, ye high hills? \[this is\] the hill \[which\] God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell \[in it\] for ever.

16: 

[[Ps.68.17|17]] The chariots of God \[are\] twenty thousand, \[even\] thousands of angels: the Lord \[is\] among them, \[as in\] Sinai, in the holy \[place\].

17: 

[[Ps.68.18|18]] Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, \[for\] the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell \[among them\].

18: 

[[Ps.68.19|19]] Blessed \[be\] the Lord, \[who\] daily loadeth us \[with benefits, even\] the God of our salvation. Selah.

19: 

[[Ps.68.20|20]] \[He that is\] our God \[is\] the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord \[belong\] the issues from death.

20: 

[[Ps.68.21|21]] But God shall wound the head of his enemies, \[and\] the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.

21: 

[[Ps.68.22|22]] The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring \[my people\] again from the depths of the sea:

22: 

[[Ps.68.23|23]] That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of \[thine\] enemies, \[and\] the tongue of thy dogs in the same.

23: 

[[Ps.68.24|24]] They have seen thy goings, O God; \[even\] the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.

24: 

[[Ps.68.25|25]] The singers went before, the players on instruments \[followed\] after; among \[them were\] the damsels playing with timbrels.

25: 

[[Ps.68.26|26]] Bless ye God in the congregations, \[even\] the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.

26: 

[[Ps.68.27|27]] There \[is\] little Benjamin \[with\] their ruler, the princes of Judah \[and\] their council, the princes of Zebulun, \[and\] the princes of Naphtali.

27: 

[[Ps.68.28|28]] Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.

28: 

[[Ps.68.29|29]] Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.

29: 

[[Ps.68.30|30]] Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, \[till every one\] submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people \[that\] delight in war.

30: 

[[Ps.68.31|31]] Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.

31: 

[[Ps.68.32|32]] Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah:

32: 

[[Ps.68.33|33]] To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, \[which were\] of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, \[and that\] a mighty voice.

33: 

[[Ps.68.34|34]] Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency \[is\] over Israel, and his strength \[is\] in the clouds.

34: 

[[Ps.68.35|35]] O God, \[thou art\] terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel \[is\] he that giveth strength and power unto \[his\] people. Blessed \[be\] God.

35:
