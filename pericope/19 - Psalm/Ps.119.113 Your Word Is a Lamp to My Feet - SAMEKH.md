[[Ps.119|Psalm 119:113 - Psalm 119:120]]
*Your Word Is a Lamp to My Feet - SAMEKH*

[[Ps.119.113|113]] SAMECH. I hate \[vain\] thoughts: but thy law do I love.

113: 

[[Ps.119.114|114]] Thou \[art\] my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.

114: 

[[Ps.119.115|115]] Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.

115: 

[[Ps.119.116|116]] Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.

116: 

[[Ps.119.117|117]] Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.

117: 

[[Ps.119.118|118]] Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit \[is\] falsehood.

118: 

[[Ps.119.119|119]] Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth \[like\] dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.

119: 

[[Ps.119.120|120]] My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.

120:
