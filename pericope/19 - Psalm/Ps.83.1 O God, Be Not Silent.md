[[Ps.83|Psalm 83:1 - Psalm 83:18]]
*O God, Be Not Silent*

[[Ps.83.0|0]] A Song \[or\] Psalm of Asaph.

0: 

[[Ps.83.1|1]] Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.

1: 

[[Ps.83.2|2]] For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.

2: 

[[Ps.83.3|3]] They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.

3: 

[[Ps.83.4|4]] They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from \[being\] a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.

4: 

[[Ps.83.5|5]] For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:

5: 

[[Ps.83.6|6]] The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;

6: 

[[Ps.83.7|7]] Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;

7: 

[[Ps.83.8|8]] Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.

8: 

[[Ps.83.9|9]] Do unto them as \[unto\] the Midianites; as \[to\] Sisera, as \[to\] Jabin, at the brook of Kison:

9: 

[[Ps.83.10|10]] \[Which\] perished at Endor: they became \[as\] dung for the earth.

10: 

[[Ps.83.11|11]] Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:

11: 

[[Ps.83.12|12]] Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.

12: 

[[Ps.83.13|13]] O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.

13: 

[[Ps.83.14|14]] As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;

14: 

[[Ps.83.15|15]] So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.

15: 

[[Ps.83.16|16]] Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.

16: 

[[Ps.83.17|17]] Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:

17: 

[[Ps.83.18|18]] That \[men\] may know that thou, whose name alone \[is\] JEHOVAH, \[art\] the most high over all the earth.

18:
