[[Ps.127|Psalm 127:1 - Psalm 127:5]]
*Children Are a Heritage from the LORD*

[[Ps.127.0|0]] A Song of degrees for Solomon.

0: 

[[Ps.127.1|1]] Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh \[but\] in vain.

1: 

[[Ps.127.2|2]] \[It is\] vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: \[for\] so he giveth his beloved sleep.

2: 

[[Ps.127.3|3]] Lo, children \[are\] an heritage of the LORD: \[and\] the fruit of the womb \[is his\] reward.

3: 

[[Ps.127.4|4]] As arrows \[are\] in the hand of a mighty man; so \[are\] children of the youth.

4: 

[[Ps.127.5|5]] Happy \[is\] the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.

5:
