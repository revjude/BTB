[[Ps.6|Psalm 6:1 - Psalm 6:10]]
*Do Not Rebuke Me in Your Anger*

[[Ps.6.0|0]] To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.

0: 

[[Ps.6.1|1]] O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.

1: 

[[Ps.6.2|2]] Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I \[am\] weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.

2: 

[[Ps.6.3|3]] My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?

3: 

[[Ps.6.4|4]] Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies’ sake.

4: 

[[Ps.6.5|5]] For in death \[there is\] no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?

5: 

[[Ps.6.6|6]] I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.

6: 

[[Ps.6.7|7]] Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.

7: 

[[Ps.6.8|8]] Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.

8: 

[[Ps.6.9|9]] The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.

9: 

[[Ps.6.10|10]] Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return \[and\] be ashamed suddenly.

10:
