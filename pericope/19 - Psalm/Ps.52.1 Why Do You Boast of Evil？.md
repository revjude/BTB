[[Ps.52|Psalm 52:1 - Psalm 52:9]]
*Why Do You Boast of Evil？*

[[Ps.52.0|0]] To the chief Musician, Maschil, \[A Psalm\] of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, David is come to the house of Ahimelech.

0: 

[[Ps.52.1|1]] Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God \[endureth\] continually.

1: 

[[Ps.52.2|2]] Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp rasor, working deceitfully.

2: 

[[Ps.52.3|3]] Thou lovest evil more than good; \[and\] lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.

3: 

[[Ps.52.4|4]] Thou lovest all devouring words, O \[thou\] deceitful tongue.

4: 

[[Ps.52.5|5]] God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of \[thy\] dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.

5: 

[[Ps.52.6|6]] The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:

6: 

[[Ps.52.7|7]] Lo, \[this is\] the man \[that\] made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, \[and\] strengthened himself in his wickedness.

7: 

[[Ps.52.8|8]] But I \[am\] like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.

8: 

[[Ps.52.9|9]] I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done \[it\]: and I will wait on thy name; for \[it is\] good before thy saints.

9:
