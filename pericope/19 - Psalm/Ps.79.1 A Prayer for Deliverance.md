[[Ps.79|Psalm 79:1 - Psalm 79:13]]
*A Prayer for Deliverance*

[[Ps.79.0|0]] A Psalm of Asaph.

0: 

[[Ps.79.1|1]] O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.

1: 

[[Ps.79.2|2]] The dead bodies of thy servants have they given \[to be\] meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.

2: 

[[Ps.79.3|3]] Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and \[there was\] none to bury \[them\].

3: 

[[Ps.79.4|4]] We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.

4: 

[[Ps.79.5|5]] How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?

5: 

[[Ps.79.6|6]] Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.

6: 

[[Ps.79.7|7]] For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.

7: 

[[Ps.79.8|8]] O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.

8: 

[[Ps.79.9|9]] Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name’s sake.

9: 

[[Ps.79.10|10]] Wherefore should the heathen say, Where \[is\] their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight \[by\] the revenging of the blood of thy servants \[which is\] shed.

10: 

[[Ps.79.11|11]] Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;

11: 

[[Ps.79.12|12]] And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.

12: 

[[Ps.79.13|13]] So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.

13:
