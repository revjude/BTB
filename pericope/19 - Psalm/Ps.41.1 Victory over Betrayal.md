[[Ps.41|Psalm 41:1 - Psalm 41:13]]
*Victory over Betrayal*

[[Ps.41.0|0]] To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

0: 

[[Ps.41.1|1]] Blessed \[is\] he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.

1: 

[[Ps.41.2|2]] The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; \[and\] he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.

2: 

[[Ps.41.3|3]] The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.

3: 

[[Ps.41.4|4]] I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.

4: 

[[Ps.41.5|5]] Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?

5: 

[[Ps.41.6|6]] And if he come to see \[me\], he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; \[when\] he goeth abroad, he telleth \[it\].

6: 

[[Ps.41.7|7]] All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.

7: 

[[Ps.41.8|8]] An evil disease, \[say they\], cleaveth fast unto him: and \[now\] that he lieth he shall rise up no more.

8: 

[[Ps.41.9|9]] Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up \[his\] heel against me.

9: 

[[Ps.41.10|10]] But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.

10: 

[[Ps.41.11|11]] By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.

11: 

[[Ps.41.12|12]] And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.

12: 

[[Ps.41.13|13]] Blessed \[be\] the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.

13:
