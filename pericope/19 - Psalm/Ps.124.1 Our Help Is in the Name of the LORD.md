[[Ps.124|Psalm 124:1 - Psalm 124:8]]
*Our Help Is in the Name of the LORD*

[[Ps.124.0|0]] A Song of degrees of David.

0: 

[[Ps.124.1|1]] If \[it had\] not \[been\] the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;

1: 

[[Ps.124.2|2]] If \[it had\] not \[been\] the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:

2: 

[[Ps.124.3|3]] Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:

3: 

[[Ps.124.4|4]] Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:

4: 

[[Ps.124.5|5]] Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.

5: 

[[Ps.124.6|6]] Blessed \[be\] the LORD, who hath not given us \[as\] a prey to their teeth.

6: 

[[Ps.124.7|7]] Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.

7: 

[[Ps.124.8|8]] Our help \[is\] in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.

8:
