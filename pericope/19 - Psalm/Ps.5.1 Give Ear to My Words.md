[[Ps.5|Psalm 5:1 - Psalm 5:12]]
*Give Ear to My Words*

[[Ps.5.0|0]] To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David.

0: 

[[Ps.5.1|1]] Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.

1: 

[[Ps.5.2|2]] Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.

2: 

[[Ps.5.3|3]] My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct \[my prayer\] unto thee, and will look up.

3: 

[[Ps.5.4|4]] For thou \[art\] not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.

4: 

[[Ps.5.5|5]] The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.

5: 

[[Ps.5.6|6]] Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.

6: 

[[Ps.5.7|7]] But as for me, I will come \[into\] thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: \[and\] in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.

7: 

[[Ps.5.8|8]] Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.

8: 

[[Ps.5.9|9]] For \[there is\] no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part \[is\] very wickedness; their throat \[is\] an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.

9: 

[[Ps.5.10|10]] Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.

10: 

[[Ps.5.11|11]] But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.

11: 

[[Ps.5.12|12]] For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as \[with\] a shield.

12:
