[[Ps.58|Psalm 58:1 - Psalm 58:11]]
*God Judges the Earth*

[[Ps.58.0|0]] To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David.

0: 

[[Ps.58.1|1]] Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?

1: 

[[Ps.58.2|2]] Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.

2: 

[[Ps.58.3|3]] The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.

3: 

[[Ps.58.4|4]] Their poison \[is\] like the poison of a serpent: \[they are\] like the deaf adder \[that\] stoppeth her ear;

4: 

[[Ps.58.5|5]] Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.

5: 

[[Ps.58.6|6]] Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.

6: 

[[Ps.58.7|7]] Let them melt away as waters \[which\] run continually: \[when\] he bendeth \[his bow to shoot\] his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.

7: 

[[Ps.58.8|8]] As a snail \[which\] melteth, let \[every one of them\] pass away: \[like\] the untimely birth of a woman, \[that\] they may not see the sun.

8: 

[[Ps.58.9|9]] Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in \[his\] wrath.

9: 

[[Ps.58.10|10]] The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.

10: 

[[Ps.58.11|11]] So that a man shall say, Verily \[there is\] a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.

11:
