0: 

[[Ps.25.1|1]] Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.

1: 

[[Ps.25.2|2]] O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.

2: 

[[Ps.25.3|3]] Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.

3: 

[[Ps.25.4|4]] Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.

4: 

[[Ps.25.5|5]] Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou \[art\] the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.

5: 

[[Ps.25.6|6]] Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they \[have been\] ever of old.

6: 

[[Ps.25.7|7]] Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness’ sake, O LORD.

7: 

[[Ps.25.8|8]] Good and upright \[is\] the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.

8: 

[[Ps.25.9|9]] The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.

9: 

[[Ps.25.10|10]] All the paths of the LORD \[are\] mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.

10: 

[[Ps.25.11|11]] For thy name’s sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it \[is\] great.

11: 

[[Ps.25.12|12]] What man \[is\] he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way \[that\] he shall choose.

12: 

[[Ps.25.13|13]] His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.

13: 

[[Ps.25.14|14]] The secret of the LORD \[is\] with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.

14: 

[[Ps.25.15|15]] Mine eyes \[are\] ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.

15: 

[[Ps.25.16|16]] Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I \[am\] desolate and afflicted.

16: 

[[Ps.25.17|17]] The troubles of my heart are enlarged: \[O\] bring thou me out of my distresses.

17: 

[[Ps.25.18|18]] Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.

18: 

[[Ps.25.19|19]] Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.

19: 

[[Ps.25.20|20]] O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.

20: 

[[Ps.25.21|21]] Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.
