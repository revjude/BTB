[[Ps.74|Psalm 74:1 - Psalm 74:23]]
*Why Have You Rejected Us Forever？*

[[Ps.74.0|0]] Maschil of Asaph.

0: 

[[Ps.74.1|1]] O God, why hast thou cast \[us\] off for ever? \[why\] doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?

1: 

[[Ps.74.2|2]] Remember thy congregation, \[which\] thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, \[which\] thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.

2: 

[[Ps.74.3|3]] Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; \[even\] all \[that\] the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.

3: 

[[Ps.74.4|4]] Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns \[for\] signs.

4: 

[[Ps.74.5|5]] \[A man\] was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.

5: 

[[Ps.74.6|6]] But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.

6: 

[[Ps.74.7|7]] They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled \[by casting down\] the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.

7: 

[[Ps.74.8|8]] They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.

8: 

[[Ps.74.9|9]] We see not our signs: \[there is\] no more any prophet: neither \[is there\] among us any that knoweth how long.

9: 

[[Ps.74.10|10]] O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?

10: 

[[Ps.74.11|11]] Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck \[it\] out of thy bosom.

11: 

[[Ps.74.12|12]] For God \[is\] my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.

12: 

[[Ps.74.13|13]] Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.

13: 

[[Ps.74.14|14]] Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, \[and\] gavest him \[to be\] meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.

14: 

[[Ps.74.15|15]] Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.

15: 

[[Ps.74.16|16]] The day \[is\] thine, the night also \[is\] thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.

16: 

[[Ps.74.17|17]] Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.

17: 

[[Ps.74.18|18]] Remember this, \[that\] the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and \[that\] the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.

18: 

[[Ps.74.19|19]] O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude \[of the wicked\]: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.

19: 

[[Ps.74.20|20]] Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.

20: 

[[Ps.74.21|21]] O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.

21: 

[[Ps.74.22|22]] Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.

22: 

[[Ps.74.23|23]] Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.

23:
