[[Ps.2|Psalm 2:1 - Psalm 2:12]]
*The Triumphant Messiah*

[[Ps.2.1|1]] Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?

1: 

[[Ps.2.2|2]] The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, \[saying\],

2: 

[[Ps.2.3|3]] Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.

3: 

[[Ps.2.4|4]] He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.

4: 

[[Ps.2.5|5]] Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.

5: 

[[Ps.2.6|6]] Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.

6: 

[[Ps.2.7|7]] I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou \[art\] my Son; this day have I begotten thee.

7: 

[[Ps.2.8|8]] Ask of me, and I shall give \[thee\] the heathen \[for\] thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth \[for\] thy possession.

8: 

[[Ps.2.9|9]] Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.

9: 

[[Ps.2.10|10]] Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.

10: 

[[Ps.2.11|11]] Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

11: 

[[Ps.2.12|12]] Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish \[from\] the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed \[are\] all they that put their trust in him.

12:
