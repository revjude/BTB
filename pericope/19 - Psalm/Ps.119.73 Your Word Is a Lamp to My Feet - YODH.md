[[Ps.119|Psalm 119:73 - Psalm 119:80]]
*Your Word Is a Lamp to My Feet - YODH*

[[Ps.119.73|73]] JOD. Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.

73: 

[[Ps.119.74|74]] They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.

74: 

[[Ps.119.75|75]] I know, O LORD, that thy judgments \[are\] right, and \[that\] thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.

75: 

[[Ps.119.76|76]] Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.

76: 

[[Ps.119.77|77]] Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law \[is\] my delight.

77: 

[[Ps.119.78|78]] Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: \[but\] I will meditate in thy precepts.

78: 

[[Ps.119.79|79]] Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.

79: 

[[Ps.119.80|80]] Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.

80:
