[[Ps.107|Psalm 107:1 - Psalm 107:43]]
*Thanksgiving for Deliverance*

[[Ps.107.1|1]] O give thanks unto the LORD, for \[he is\] good: for his mercy \[endureth\] for ever.

1: 

[[Ps.107.2|2]] Let the redeemed of the LORD say \[so\], whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;

2: 

[[Ps.107.3|3]] And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.

3: 

[[Ps.107.4|4]] They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.

4: 

[[Ps.107.5|5]] Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.

5: 

[[Ps.107.6|6]] Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, \[and\] he delivered them out of their distresses.

6: 

[[Ps.107.7|7]] And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.

7: 

[[Ps.107.8|8]] Oh that \[men\] would praise the LORD \[for\] his goodness, and \[for\] his wonderful works to the children of men!

8: 

[[Ps.107.9|9]] For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.

9: 

[[Ps.107.10|10]] Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, \[being\] bound in affliction and iron;

10: 

[[Ps.107.11|11]] Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:

11: 

[[Ps.107.12|12]] Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and \[there was\] none to help.

12: 

[[Ps.107.13|13]] Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, \[and\] he saved them out of their distresses.

13: 

[[Ps.107.14|14]] He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.

14: 

[[Ps.107.15|15]] Oh that \[men\] would praise the LORD \[for\] his goodness, and \[for\] his wonderful works to the children of men!

15: 

[[Ps.107.16|16]] For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.

16: 

[[Ps.107.17|17]] Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.

17: 

[[Ps.107.18|18]] Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.

18: 

[[Ps.107.19|19]] Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, \[and\] he saveth them out of their distresses.

19: 

[[Ps.107.20|20]] He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered \[them\] from their destructions.

20: 

[[Ps.107.21|21]] Oh that \[men\] would praise the LORD \[for\] his goodness, and \[for\] his wonderful works to the children of men!

21: 

[[Ps.107.22|22]] And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.

22: 

[[Ps.107.23|23]] They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;

23: 

[[Ps.107.24|24]] These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.

24: 

[[Ps.107.25|25]] For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.

25: 

[[Ps.107.26|26]] They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.

26: 

[[Ps.107.27|27]] They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits’ end.

27: 

[[Ps.107.28|28]] Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.

28: 

[[Ps.107.29|29]] He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.

29: 

[[Ps.107.30|30]] Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.

30: 

[[Ps.107.31|31]] Oh that \[men\] would praise the LORD \[for\] his goodness, and \[for\] his wonderful works to the children of men!

31: 

[[Ps.107.32|32]] Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.

32: 

[[Ps.107.33|33]] He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;

33: 

[[Ps.107.34|34]] A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.

34: 

[[Ps.107.35|35]] He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.

35: 

[[Ps.107.36|36]] And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;

36: 

[[Ps.107.37|37]] And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.

37: 

[[Ps.107.38|38]] He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.

38: 

[[Ps.107.39|39]] Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.

39: 

[[Ps.107.40|40]] He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, \[where there is\] no way.

40: 

[[Ps.107.41|41]] Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh \[him\] families like a flock.

41: 

[[Ps.107.42|42]] The righteous shall see \[it\], and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.

42: 

[[Ps.107.43|43]] Whoso \[is\] wise, and will observe these \[things\], even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.

43:
