*You Have Heard My Vows*

[[Ps.61.0|0]] To the chief Musician upon Neginah, \[A Psalm\] of David.

0: 

[[Ps.61.1|1]] Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.

1: 

[[Ps.61.2|2]] From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock \[that\] is higher than I.

2: 

[[Ps.61.3|3]] For thou hast been a shelter for me, \[and\] a strong tower from the enemy.

3: 

[[Ps.61.4|4]] I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.

4: 

[[Ps.61.5|5]] For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given \[me\] the heritage of those that fear thy name.

5: 

[[Ps.61.6|6]] Thou wilt prolong the king’s life: \[and\] his years as many generations.

6: 

[[Ps.61.7|7]] He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, \[which\] may preserve him.

7: 

[[Ps.61.8|8]] So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.

8:
