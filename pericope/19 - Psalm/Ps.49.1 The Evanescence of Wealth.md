[[Ps.49|Psalm 49:1 - Psalm 49:20]]
*The Evanescence of Wealth*

[[Ps.49.0|0]] To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.

0: 

[[Ps.49.1|1]] Hear this, all \[ye\] people; give ear, all \[ye\] inhabitants of the world:

1: 

[[Ps.49.2|2]] Both low and high, rich and poor, together.

2: 

[[Ps.49.3|3]] My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart \[shall be\] of understanding.

3: 

[[Ps.49.4|4]] I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.

4: 

[[Ps.49.5|5]] Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, \[when\] the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?

5: 

[[Ps.49.6|6]] They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;

6: 

[[Ps.49.7|7]] None \[of them\] can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:

7: 

[[Ps.49.8|8]] (For the redemption of their soul \[is\] precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)

8: 

[[Ps.49.9|9]] That he should still live for ever, \[and\] not see corruption.

9: 

[[Ps.49.10|10]] For he seeth \[that\] wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.

10: 

[[Ps.49.11|11]] Their inward thought \[is, that\] their houses \[shall continue\] for ever, \[and\] their dwelling places to all generations; they call \[their\] lands after their own names.

11: 

[[Ps.49.12|12]] Nevertheless man \[being\] in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts \[that\] perish.

12: 

[[Ps.49.13|13]] This their way \[is\] their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.

13: 

[[Ps.49.14|14]] Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.

14: 

[[Ps.49.15|15]] But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.

15: 

[[Ps.49.16|16]] Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;

16: 

[[Ps.49.17|17]] For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.

17: 

[[Ps.49.18|18]] Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and \[men\] will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.

18: 

[[Ps.49.19|19]] He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.

19: 

[[Ps.49.20|20]] Man \[that is\] in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts \[that\] perish.

20:
