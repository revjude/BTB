[[Ps.72|Psalm 72:1 - Psalm 72:20]]
*Endow the King with Your Justice*

[[Ps.72.0|0]] \[A Psalm\] for Solomon.

0: 

[[Ps.72.1|1]] Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king’s son.

1: 

[[Ps.72.2|2]] He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.

2: 

[[Ps.72.3|3]] The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.

3: 

[[Ps.72.4|4]] He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.

4: 

[[Ps.72.5|5]] They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.

5: 

[[Ps.72.6|6]] He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers \[that\] water the earth.

6: 

[[Ps.72.7|7]] In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.

7: 

[[Ps.72.8|8]] He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.

8: 

[[Ps.72.9|9]] They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.

9: 

[[Ps.72.10|10]] The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

10: 

[[Ps.72.11|11]] Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.

11: 

[[Ps.72.12|12]] For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and \[him\] that hath no helper.

12: 

[[Ps.72.13|13]] He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.

13: 

[[Ps.72.14|14]] He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.

14: 

[[Ps.72.15|15]] And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; \[and\] daily shall he be praised.

15: 

[[Ps.72.16|16]] There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and \[they\] of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.

16: 

[[Ps.72.17|17]] His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and \[men\] shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.

17: 

[[Ps.72.18|18]] Blessed \[be\] the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.

18: 

[[Ps.72.19|19]] And blessed \[be\] his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled \[with\] his glory; Amen, and Amen.

19: 

[[Ps.72.20|20]] The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.

20:
