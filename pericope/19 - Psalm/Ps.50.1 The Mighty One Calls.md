[[Ps.50|Psalm 50:1 - Psalm 50:23]]
*The Mighty One Calls*

[[Ps.50.0|0]] A Psalm of Asaph.

0: 

[[Ps.50.1|1]] The mighty God, \[even\] the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.

1: 

[[Ps.50.2|2]] Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.

2: 

[[Ps.50.3|3]] Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.

3: 

[[Ps.50.4|4]] He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.

4: 

[[Ps.50.5|5]] Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.

5: 

[[Ps.50.6|6]] And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God \[is\] judge himself. Selah.

6: 

[[Ps.50.7|7]] Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I \[am\] God, \[even\] thy God.

7: 

[[Ps.50.8|8]] I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, \[to have been\] continually before me.

8: 

[[Ps.50.9|9]] I will take no bullock out of thy house, \[nor\] he goats out of thy folds.

9: 

[[Ps.50.10|10]] For every beast of the forest \[is\] mine, \[and\] the cattle upon a thousand hills.

10: 

[[Ps.50.11|11]] I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field \[are\] mine.

11: 

[[Ps.50.12|12]] If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world \[is\] mine, and the fulness thereof.

12: 

[[Ps.50.13|13]] Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?

13: 

[[Ps.50.14|14]] Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:

14: 

[[Ps.50.15|15]] And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.

15: 

[[Ps.50.16|16]] But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or \[that\] thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?

16: 

[[Ps.50.17|17]] Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.

17: 

[[Ps.50.18|18]] When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.

18: 

[[Ps.50.19|19]] Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.

19: 

[[Ps.50.20|20]] Thou sittest \[and\] speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother’s son.

20: 

[[Ps.50.21|21]] These \[things\] hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether \[such an one\] as thyself: \[but\] I will reprove thee, and set \[them\] in order before thine eyes.

21: 

[[Ps.50.22|22]] Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear \[you\] in pieces, and \[there be\] none to deliver.

22: 

[[Ps.50.23|23]] Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth \[his\] conversation \[aright\] will I shew the salvation of God.

23:
