[[Ps.16|Psalm 16:1 - Psalm 16:11]]
*The Presence of the LORD*

[[Ps.16.0|0]] Michtam of David.

0: 

[[Ps.16.1|1]] Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.

1: 

[[Ps.16.2|2]] \[O my soul\], thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou \[art\] my Lord: my goodness \[extendeth\] not to thee;

2: 

[[Ps.16.3|3]] \[But\] to the saints that \[are\] in the earth, and \[to\] the excellent, in whom \[is\] all my delight.

3: 

[[Ps.16.4|4]] Their sorrows shall be multiplied \[that\] hasten \[after\] another \[god\]: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.

4: 

[[Ps.16.5|5]] The LORD \[is\] the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.

5: 

[[Ps.16.6|6]] The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant \[places\]; yea, I have a goodly heritage.

6: 

[[Ps.16.7|7]] I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.

7: 

[[Ps.16.8|8]] I have set the LORD always before me: because \[he is\] at my right hand, I shall not be moved.

8: 

[[Ps.16.9|9]] Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.

9: 

[[Ps.16.10|10]] For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.

10: 

[[Ps.16.11|11]] Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence \[is\] fulness of joy; at thy right hand \[there are\] pleasures for evermore.

11:
