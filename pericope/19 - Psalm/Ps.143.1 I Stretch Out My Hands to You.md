[[Ps.143|Psalm 143:1 - Psalm 143:12]]
*I Stretch Out My Hands to You*

[[Ps.143.0|0]] A Psalm of David.

0: 

[[Ps.143.1|1]] Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, \[and\] in thy righteousness.

1: 

[[Ps.143.2|2]] And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.

2: 

[[Ps.143.3|3]] For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.

3: 

[[Ps.143.4|4]] Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.

4: 

[[Ps.143.5|5]] I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.

5: 

[[Ps.143.6|6]] I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul \[thirsteth\] after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.

6: 

[[Ps.143.7|7]] Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.

7: 

[[Ps.143.8|8]] Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.

8: 

[[Ps.143.9|9]] Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.

9: 

[[Ps.143.10|10]] Teach me to do thy will; for thou \[art\] my God: thy spirit \[is\] good; lead me into the land of uprightness.

10: 

[[Ps.143.11|11]] Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name’s sake: for thy righteousness’ sake bring my soul out of trouble.

11: 

[[Ps.143.12|12]] And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I \[am\] thy servant.

12:
