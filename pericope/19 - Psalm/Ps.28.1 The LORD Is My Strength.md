[[Ps.28|Psalm 28:1 - Psalm 28:9]]
*The LORD Is My Strength*

[[Ps.28.0|0]] \[A Psalm\] of David.

0: 

[[Ps.28.1|1]] Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, \[if\] thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.

1: 

[[Ps.28.2|2]] Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.

2: 

[[Ps.28.3|3]] Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief \[is\] in their hearts.

3: 

[[Ps.28.4|4]] Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.

4: 

[[Ps.28.5|5]] Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.

5: 

[[Ps.28.6|6]] Blessed \[be\] the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.

6: 

[[Ps.28.7|7]] The LORD \[is\] my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.

7: 

[[Ps.28.8|8]] The LORD \[is\] their strength, and he \[is\] the saving strength of his anointed.

8: 

[[Ps.28.9|9]] Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.

9:
