*Save Me by Your Name*

[[Ps.54.0|0]] To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, \[A Psalm\] of David, when the Ziphims came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us?

0: 

[[Ps.54.1|1]] Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.

1: 

[[Ps.54.2|2]] Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.

2: 

[[Ps.54.3|3]] For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.

3: 

[[Ps.54.4|4]] Behold, God \[is\] mine helper: the Lord \[is\] with them that uphold my soul.

4: 

[[Ps.54.5|5]] He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.

5: 

[[Ps.54.6|6]] I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for \[it is\] good.

6: 

[[Ps.54.7|7]] For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen \[his desire\] upon mine enemies.

7:
