[[Ps.63|Psalm 63:1 - Psalm 63:11]]
*Thirsting for God*

[[Ps.63.0|0]] A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.

0: 

[[Ps.63.1|1]] O God, thou \[art\] my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;

1: 

[[Ps.63.2|2]] To see thy power and thy glory, so \[as\] I have seen thee in the sanctuary.

2: 

[[Ps.63.3|3]] Because thy lovingkindness \[is\] better than life, my lips shall praise thee.

3: 

[[Ps.63.4|4]] Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.

4: 

[[Ps.63.5|5]] My soul shall be satisfied as \[with\] marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise \[thee\] with joyful lips:

5: 

[[Ps.63.6|6]] When I remember thee upon my bed, \[and\] meditate on thee in the \[night\] watches.

6: 

[[Ps.63.7|7]] Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.

7: 

[[Ps.63.8|8]] My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.

8: 

[[Ps.63.9|9]] But those \[that\] seek my soul, to destroy \[it\], shall go into the lower parts of the earth.

9: 

[[Ps.63.10|10]] They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.

10: 

[[Ps.63.11|11]] But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.

11:
