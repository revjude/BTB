[[Ps.60|Psalm 60:1 - Psalm 60:12]]
*Victory with God*

[[Ps.60.0|0]] To the chief Musician upon Shushaneduth, Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aramnaharaim and with Aramzobah, when Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the valley of salt twelve thousand.

0: 

[[Ps.60.1|1]] O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.

1: 

[[Ps.60.2|2]] Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.

2: 

[[Ps.60.3|3]] Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.

3: 

[[Ps.60.4|4]] Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.

4: 

[[Ps.60.5|5]] That thy beloved may be delivered; save \[with\] thy right hand, and hear me.

5: 

[[Ps.60.6|6]] God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

6: 

[[Ps.60.7|7]] Gilead \[is\] mine, and Manasseh \[is\] mine; Ephraim also \[is\] the strength of mine head; Judah \[is\] my lawgiver;

7: 

[[Ps.60.8|8]] Moab \[is\] my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.

8: 

[[Ps.60.9|9]] Who will bring me \[into\] the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?

9: 

[[Ps.60.10|10]] \[Wilt\] not thou, O God, \[which\] hadst cast us off? and \[thou\], O God, \[which\] didst not go out with our armies?

10: 

[[Ps.60.11|11]] Give us help from trouble: for vain \[is\] the help of man.

11: 

[[Ps.60.12|12]] Through God we shall do valiantly: for he \[it is that\] shall tread down our enemies.

12:
