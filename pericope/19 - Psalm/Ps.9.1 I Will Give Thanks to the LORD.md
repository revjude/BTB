[[Ps.9|Psalm 9:1 - Psalm 9:20]]
*I Will Give Thanks to the LORD*

[[Ps.9.0|0]] To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David.

0: 

[[Ps.9.1|1]] I will praise \[thee\], O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.

1: 

[[Ps.9.2|2]] I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.

2: 

[[Ps.9.3|3]] When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.

3: 

[[Ps.9.4|4]] For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.

4: 

[[Ps.9.5|5]] Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.

5: 

[[Ps.9.6|6]] O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.

6: 

[[Ps.9.7|7]] But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.

7: 

[[Ps.9.8|8]] And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.

8: 

[[Ps.9.9|9]] The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.

9: 

[[Ps.9.10|10]] And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.

10: 

[[Ps.9.11|11]] Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.

11: 

[[Ps.9.12|12]] When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.

12: 

[[Ps.9.13|13]] Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble \[which I suffer\] of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:

13: 

[[Ps.9.14|14]] That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.

14: 

[[Ps.9.15|15]] The heathen are sunk down in the pit \[that\] they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.

15: 

[[Ps.9.16|16]] The LORD is known \[by\] the judgment \[which\] he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.

16: 

[[Ps.9.17|17]] The wicked shall be turned into hell, \[and\] all the nations that forget God.

17: 

[[Ps.9.18|18]] For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall \[not\] perish for ever.

18: 

[[Ps.9.19|19]] Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.

19: 

[[Ps.9.20|20]] Put them in fear, O LORD: \[that\] the nations may know themselves \[to be but\] men. Selah.

20:
