[[Ps.55|Psalm 55:1 - Psalm 55:23]]
*Cast Your Burden upon the LORD*

[[Ps.55.0|0]] To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, \[A Psalm\] of David.

0: 

[[Ps.55.1|1]] Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.

1: 

[[Ps.55.2|2]] Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;

2: 

[[Ps.55.3|3]] Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.

3: 

[[Ps.55.4|4]] My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.

4: 

[[Ps.55.5|5]] Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.

5: 

[[Ps.55.6|6]] And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! \[for then\] would I fly away, and be at rest.

6: 

[[Ps.55.7|7]] Lo, \[then\] would I wander far off, \[and\] remain in the wilderness. Selah.

7: 

[[Ps.55.8|8]] I would hasten my escape from the windy storm \[and\] tempest.

8: 

[[Ps.55.9|9]] Destroy, O Lord, \[and\] divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.

9: 

[[Ps.55.10|10]] Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow \[are\] in the midst of it.

10: 

[[Ps.55.11|11]] Wickedness \[is\] in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.

11: 

[[Ps.55.12|12]] For \[it was\] not an enemy \[that\] reproached me; then I could have borne \[it\]: neither \[was it\] he that hated me \[that\] did magnify \[himself\] against me; then I would have hid myself from him:

12: 

[[Ps.55.13|13]] But \[it was\] thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.

13: 

[[Ps.55.14|14]] We took sweet counsel together, \[and\] walked unto the house of God in company.

14: 

[[Ps.55.15|15]] Let death seize upon them, \[and\] let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness \[is\] in their dwellings, \[and\] among them.

15: 

[[Ps.55.16|16]] As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.

16: 

[[Ps.55.17|17]] Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.

17: 

[[Ps.55.18|18]] He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle \[that was\] against me: for there were many with me.

18: 

[[Ps.55.19|19]] God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.

19: 

[[Ps.55.20|20]] He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.

20: 

[[Ps.55.21|21]] \[The words\] of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war \[was\] in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet \[were\] they drawn swords.

21: 

[[Ps.55.22|22]] Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.

22: 

[[Ps.55.23|23]] But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.

23:
