[[Ps.33|Psalm 33:1 - Psalm 33:22]]
*Praise to the Creator*

[[Ps.33.1|1]] Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: \[for\] praise is comely for the upright.

1: 

[[Ps.33.2|2]] Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery \[and\] an instrument of ten strings.

2: 

[[Ps.33.3|3]] Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.

3: 

[[Ps.33.4|4]] For the word of the LORD \[is\] right; and all his works \[are done\] in truth.

4: 

[[Ps.33.5|5]] He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.

5: 

[[Ps.33.6|6]] By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.

6: 

[[Ps.33.7|7]] He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.

7: 

[[Ps.33.8|8]] Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.

8: 

[[Ps.33.9|9]] For he spake, and it was \[done\]; he commanded, and it stood fast.

9: 

[[Ps.33.10|10]] The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.

10: 

[[Ps.33.11|11]] The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.

11: 

[[Ps.33.12|12]] Blessed \[is\] the nation whose God \[is\] the LORD; \[and\] the people \[whom\] he hath chosen for his own inheritance.

12: 

[[Ps.33.13|13]] The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.

13: 

[[Ps.33.14|14]] From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.

14: 

[[Ps.33.15|15]] He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.

15: 

[[Ps.33.16|16]] There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.

16: 

[[Ps.33.17|17]] An horse \[is\] a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver \[any\] by his great strength.

17: 

[[Ps.33.18|18]] Behold, the eye of the LORD \[is\] upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;

18: 

[[Ps.33.19|19]] To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.

19: 

[[Ps.33.20|20]] Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he \[is\] our help and our shield.

20: 

[[Ps.33.21|21]] For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.

21: 

[[Ps.33.22|22]] Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.

22:
