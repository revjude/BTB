[[Ps.93|Psalm 93:1 - Psalm 93:5]]
*The LORD Reigns!*

[[Ps.93.1|1]] The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, \[wherewith\] he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.

1: 

[[Ps.93.2|2]] Thy throne \[is\] established of old: thou \[art\] from everlasting.

2: 

[[Ps.93.3|3]] The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.

3: 

[[Ps.93.4|4]] The LORD on high \[is\] mightier than the noise of many waters, \[yea, than\] the mighty waves of the sea.

4: 

[[Ps.93.5|5]] Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.

5:
