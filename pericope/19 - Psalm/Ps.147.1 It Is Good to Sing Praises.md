[[Ps.147|Psalm 147:1 - Psalm 147:20]]
*It Is Good to Sing Praises*

[[Ps.147.1|1]] Praise ye the LORD: for \[it is\] good to sing praises unto our God; for \[it is\] pleasant; \[and\] praise is comely.

1: 

[[Ps.147.2|2]] The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.

2: 

[[Ps.147.3|3]] He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.

3: 

[[Ps.147.4|4]] He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by \[their\] names.

4: 

[[Ps.147.5|5]] Great \[is\] our Lord, and of great power: his understanding \[is\] infinite.

5: 

[[Ps.147.6|6]] The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground.

6: 

[[Ps.147.7|7]] Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God:

7: 

[[Ps.147.8|8]] Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.

8: 

[[Ps.147.9|9]] He giveth to the beast his food, \[and\] to the young ravens which cry.

9: 

[[Ps.147.10|10]] He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.

10: 

[[Ps.147.11|11]] The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.

11: 

[[Ps.147.12|12]] Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.

12: 

[[Ps.147.13|13]] For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.

13: 

[[Ps.147.14|14]] He maketh peace \[in\] thy borders, \[and\] filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.

14: 

[[Ps.147.15|15]] He sendeth forth his commandment \[upon\] earth: his word runneth very swiftly.

15: 

[[Ps.147.16|16]] He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.

16: 

[[Ps.147.17|17]] He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?

17: 

[[Ps.147.18|18]] He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, \[and\] the waters flow.

18: 

[[Ps.147.19|19]] He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.

19: 

[[Ps.147.20|20]] He hath not dealt so with any nation: and \[as for his\] judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.

20:
