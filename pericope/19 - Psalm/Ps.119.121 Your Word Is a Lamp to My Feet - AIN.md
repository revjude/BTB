[[Ps.119|Psalm 119:121 - Psalm 119:128]]
*Your Word Is a Lamp to My Feet - AIN*

[[Ps.119.121|121]] I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.

121: 

[[Ps.119.122|122]] Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.

122: 

[[Ps.119.123|123]] Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.

123: 

[[Ps.119.124|124]] Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.

124: 

[[Ps.119.125|125]] I \[am\] thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.

125: 

[[Ps.119.126|126]] \[It is\] time for \[thee\], LORD, to work: \[for\] they have made void thy law.

126: 

[[Ps.119.127|127]] Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.

127: 

[[Ps.119.128|128]] Therefore I esteem all \[thy\] precepts \[concerning\] all \[things to be\] right; \[and\] I hate every false way.

128:
