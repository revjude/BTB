[[Ps.118|Psalm 118:1 - Psalm 118:29]]
*The LORD Is on My Side*

[[Ps.118.1|1]] O give thanks unto the LORD; for \[he is\] good: because his mercy \[endureth\] for ever.

1: 

[[Ps.118.2|2]] Let Israel now say, that his mercy \[endureth\] for ever.

2: 

[[Ps.118.3|3]] Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy \[endureth\] for ever.

3: 

[[Ps.118.4|4]] Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy \[endureth\] for ever.

4: 

[[Ps.118.5|5]] I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, \[and set me\] in a large place.

5: 

[[Ps.118.6|6]] The LORD \[is\] on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?

6: 

[[Ps.118.7|7]] The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see \[my desire\] upon them that hate me.

7: 

[[Ps.118.8|8]] \[It is\] better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.

8: 

[[Ps.118.9|9]] \[It is\] better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.

9: 

[[Ps.118.10|10]] All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.

10: 

[[Ps.118.11|11]] They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.

11: 

[[Ps.118.12|12]] They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.

12: 

[[Ps.118.13|13]] Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.

13: 

[[Ps.118.14|14]] The LORD \[is\] my strength and song, and is become my salvation.

14: 

[[Ps.118.15|15]] The voice of rejoicing and salvation \[is\] in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.

15: 

[[Ps.118.16|16]] The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.

16: 

[[Ps.118.17|17]] I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.

17: 

[[Ps.118.18|18]] The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.

18: 

[[Ps.118.19|19]] Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, \[and\] I will praise the LORD:

19: 

[[Ps.118.20|20]] This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.

20: 

[[Ps.118.21|21]] I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.

21: 

[[Ps.118.22|22]] The stone \[which\] the builders refused is become the head \[stone\] of the corner.

22: 

[[Ps.118.23|23]] This is the LORD’S doing; it \[is\] marvellous in our eyes.

23: 

[[Ps.118.24|24]] This \[is\] the day \[which\] the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.

24: 

[[Ps.118.25|25]] Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.

25: 

[[Ps.118.26|26]] Blessed \[be\] he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.

26: 

[[Ps.118.27|27]] God \[is\] the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, \[even\] unto the horns of the altar.

27: 

[[Ps.118.28|28]] Thou \[art\] my God, and I will praise thee: \[thou art\] my God, I will exalt thee.

28: 

[[Ps.118.29|29]] O give thanks unto the LORD; for \[he is\] good: for his mercy \[endureth\] for ever.

29:
