[[Ps.59|Psalm 59:1 - Psalm 59:17]]
*Deliver Me from My Enemies*

[[Ps.59.0|0]] To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.

0: 

[[Ps.59.1|1]] Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.

1: 

[[Ps.59.2|2]] Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.

2: 

[[Ps.59.3|3]] For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not \[for\] my transgression, nor \[for\] my sin, O LORD.

3: 

[[Ps.59.4|4]] They run and prepare themselves without \[my\] fault: awake to help me, and behold.

4: 

[[Ps.59.5|5]] Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.

5: 

[[Ps.59.6|6]] They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.

6: 

[[Ps.59.7|7]] Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords \[are\] in their lips: for who, \[say they\], doth hear?

7: 

[[Ps.59.8|8]] But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.

8: 

[[Ps.59.9|9]] \[Because of\] his strength will I wait upon thee: for God \[is\] my defence.

9: 

[[Ps.59.10|10]] The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see \[my desire\] upon mine enemies.

10: 

[[Ps.59.11|11]] Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.

11: 

[[Ps.59.12|12]] \[For\] the sin of their mouth \[and\] the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying \[which\] they speak.

12: 

[[Ps.59.13|13]] Consume \[them\] in wrath, consume \[them\], that they \[may\] not \[be\]: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.

13: 

[[Ps.59.14|14]] And at evening let them return; \[and\] let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.

14: 

[[Ps.59.15|15]] Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.

15: 

[[Ps.59.16|16]] But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.

16: 

[[Ps.59.17|17]] Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God \[is\] my defence, \[and\] the God of my mercy.

17:
