[[Ps.86|Psalm 86:1 - Psalm 86:17]]
*Tried but Trusting*

[[Ps.86.0|0]] A Prayer of David.

0: 

[[Ps.86.1|1]] Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I \[am\] poor and needy.

1: 

[[Ps.86.2|2]] Preserve my soul; for I \[am\] holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.

2: 

[[Ps.86.3|3]] Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.

3: 

[[Ps.86.4|4]] Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.

4: 

[[Ps.86.5|5]] For thou, Lord, \[art\] good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.

5: 

[[Ps.86.6|6]] Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications.

6: 

[[Ps.86.7|7]] In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.

7: 

[[Ps.86.8|8]] Among the gods \[there is\] none like unto thee, O Lord; neither \[are there any works\] like unto thy works.

8: 

[[Ps.86.9|9]] All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.

9: 

[[Ps.86.10|10]] For thou \[art\] great, and doest wondrous things: thou \[art\] God alone.

10: 

[[Ps.86.11|11]] Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.

11: 

[[Ps.86.12|12]] I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.

12: 

[[Ps.86.13|13]] For great \[is\] thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.

13: 

[[Ps.86.14|14]] O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent \[men\] have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.

14: 

[[Ps.86.15|15]] But thou, O Lord, \[art\] a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.

15: 

[[Ps.86.16|16]] O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.

16: 

[[Ps.86.17|17]] Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see \[it\], and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.

17:
