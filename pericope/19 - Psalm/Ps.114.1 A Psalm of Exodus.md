[[Ps.114|Psalm 114:1 - Psalm 114:8]]
*A Psalm of Exodus*

[[Ps.114.1|1]] When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;

1: 

[[Ps.114.2|2]] Judah was his sanctuary, \[and\] Israel his dominion.

2: 

[[Ps.114.3|3]] The sea saw \[it\], and fled: Jordan was driven back.

3: 

[[Ps.114.4|4]] The mountains skipped like rams, \[and\] the little hills like lambs.

4: 

[[Ps.114.5|5]] What \[ailed\] thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, \[that\] thou wast driven back?

5: 

[[Ps.114.6|6]] Ye mountains, \[that\] ye skipped like rams; \[and\] ye little hills, like lambs?

6: 

[[Ps.114.7|7]] Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;

7: 

[[Ps.114.8|8]] Which turned the rock \[into\] a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.

8:
