[[Ps.66|Psalm 66:1 - Psalm 66:20]]
*Make a Joyful Noise*

[[Ps.66.0|0]] To the chief Musician, A Song \[or\] Psalm.

0: 

[[Ps.66.1|1]] Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:

1: 

[[Ps.66.2|2]] Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.

2: 

[[Ps.66.3|3]] Say unto God, How terrible \[art thou in\] thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.

3: 

[[Ps.66.4|4]] All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing \[to\] thy name. Selah.

4: 

[[Ps.66.5|5]] Come and see the works of God: \[he is\] terrible \[in his\] doing toward the children of men.

5: 

[[Ps.66.6|6]] He turned the sea into dry \[land\]: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.

6: 

[[Ps.66.7|7]] He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.

7: 

[[Ps.66.8|8]] O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:

8: 

[[Ps.66.9|9]] Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.

9: 

[[Ps.66.10|10]] For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.

10: 

[[Ps.66.11|11]] Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins.

11: 

[[Ps.66.12|12]] Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy \[place\].

12: 

[[Ps.66.13|13]] I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,

13: 

[[Ps.66.14|14]] Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.

14: 

[[Ps.66.15|15]] I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.

15: 

[[Ps.66.16|16]] Come \[and\] hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.

16: 

[[Ps.66.17|17]] I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.

17: 

[[Ps.66.18|18]] If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear \[me\]:

18: 

[[Ps.66.19|19]] \[But\] verily God hath heard \[me\]; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.

19: 

[[Ps.66.20|20]] Blessed \[be\] God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.

20:
