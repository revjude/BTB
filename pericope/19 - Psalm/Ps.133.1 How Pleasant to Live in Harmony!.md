[[Ps.133|Psalm 133:1 - Psalm 133:3]]
*How Pleasant to Live in Harmony!*

[[Ps.133.0|0]] A Song of degrees of David.

0: 

[[Ps.133.1|1]] Behold, how good and how pleasant \[it is\] for brethren to dwell together in unity!

1: 

[[Ps.133.2|2]] \[It is\] like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, \[even\] Aaron’s beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;

2: 

[[Ps.133.3|3]] As the dew of Hermon, \[and as the dew\] that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, \[even\] life for evermore.

3:
