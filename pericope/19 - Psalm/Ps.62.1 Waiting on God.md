[[Ps.62|Psalm 62:1 - Psalm 62:12]]
*Waiting on God*

[[Ps.62.0|0]] To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.

0: 

[[Ps.62.1|1]] Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him \[cometh\] my salvation.

1: 

[[Ps.62.2|2]] He only \[is\] my rock and my salvation; \[he is\] my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.

2: 

[[Ps.62.3|3]] How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall \[shall ye be, and as\] a tottering fence.

3: 

[[Ps.62.4|4]] They only consult to cast \[him\] down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.

4: 

[[Ps.62.5|5]] My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation \[is\] from him.

5: 

[[Ps.62.6|6]] He only \[is\] my rock and my salvation: \[he is\] my defence; I shall not be moved.

6: 

[[Ps.62.7|7]] In God \[is\] my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, \[and\] my refuge, \[is\] in God.

7: 

[[Ps.62.8|8]] Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God \[is\] a refuge for us. Selah.

8: 

[[Ps.62.9|9]] Surely men of low degree \[are\] vanity, \[and\] men of high degree \[are\] a lie: to be laid in the balance, they \[are\] altogether \[lighter\] than vanity.

9: 

[[Ps.62.10|10]] Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart \[upon them\].

10: 

[[Ps.62.11|11]] God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power \[belongeth\] unto God.

11: 

[[Ps.62.12|12]] Also unto thee, O Lord, \[belongeth\] mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.

12:
