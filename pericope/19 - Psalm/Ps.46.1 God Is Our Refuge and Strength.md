[[Ps.46|Psalm 46:1 - Psalm 46:11]]
*God Is Our Refuge and Strength*

[[Ps.46.0|0]] To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, A Song upon Alamoth.

0: 

[[Ps.46.1|1]] God \[is\] our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.

1: 

[[Ps.46.2|2]] Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;

2: 

[[Ps.46.3|3]] \[Though\] the waters thereof roar \[and\] be troubled, \[though\] the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.

3: 

[[Ps.46.4|4]] \[There is\] a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy \[place\] of the tabernacles of the most High.

4: 

[[Ps.46.5|5]] God \[is\] in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, \[and that\] right early.

5: 

[[Ps.46.6|6]] The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.

6: 

[[Ps.46.7|7]] The LORD of hosts \[is\] with us; the God of Jacob \[is\] our refuge. Selah.

7: 

[[Ps.46.8|8]] Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.

8: 

[[Ps.46.9|9]] He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.

9: 

[[Ps.46.10|10]] Be still, and know that I \[am\] God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.

10: 

[[Ps.46.11|11]] The LORD of hosts \[is\] with us; the God of Jacob \[is\] our refuge. Selah.

11:
