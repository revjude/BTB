[[Ps.43|Psalm 43:1 - Psalm 43:5]]
*Send Out Your Light*

[[Ps.43.1|1]] Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.

1: 

[[Ps.43.2|2]] For thou \[art\] the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

2: 

[[Ps.43.3|3]] O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.

3: 

[[Ps.43.4|4]] Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.

4: 

[[Ps.43.5|5]] Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, \[who is\] the health of my countenance, and my God.

5:
