[[Ps.22|Psalm 22:1 - Psalm 22:31]]
*The Psalm of the Cross*

[[Ps.22.0|0]] To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar, A Psalm of David.

0: 

[[Ps.22.1|1]] My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? \[why art thou so\] far from helping me, \[and from\] the words of my roaring?

1: 

[[Ps.22.2|2]] O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.

2: 

[[Ps.22.3|3]] But thou \[art\] holy, \[O thou\] that inhabitest the praises of Israel.

3: 

[[Ps.22.4|4]] Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.

4: 

[[Ps.22.5|5]] They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.

5: 

[[Ps.22.6|6]] But I \[am\] a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.

6: 

[[Ps.22.7|7]] All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, \[saying\],

7: 

[[Ps.22.8|8]] He trusted on the LORD \[that\] he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.

8: 

[[Ps.22.9|9]] But thou \[art\] he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope \[when I was\] upon my mother’s breasts.

9: 

[[Ps.22.10|10]] I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou \[art\] my God from my mother’s belly.

10: 

[[Ps.22.11|11]] Be not far from me; for trouble \[is\] near; for \[there is\] none to help.

11: 

[[Ps.22.12|12]] Many bulls have compassed me: strong \[bulls\] of Bashan have beset me round.

12: 

[[Ps.22.13|13]] They gaped upon me \[with\] their mouths, \[as\] a ravening and a roaring lion.

13: 

[[Ps.22.14|14]] I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.

14: 

[[Ps.22.15|15]] My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.

15: 

[[Ps.22.16|16]] For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.

16: 

[[Ps.22.17|17]] I may tell all my bones: they look \[and\] stare upon me.

17: 

[[Ps.22.18|18]] They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.

18: 

[[Ps.22.19|19]] But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.

19: 

[[Ps.22.20|20]] Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.

20: 

[[Ps.22.21|21]] Save me from the lion’s mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.

21: 

[[Ps.22.22|22]] I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.

22: 

[[Ps.22.23|23]] Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.

23: 

[[Ps.22.24|24]] For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.

24: 

[[Ps.22.25|25]] My praise \[shall be\] of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.

25: 

[[Ps.22.26|26]] The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.

26: 

[[Ps.22.27|27]] All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.

27: 

[[Ps.22.28|28]] For the kingdom \[is\] the LORD’S: and he \[is\] the governor among the nations.

28: 

[[Ps.22.29|29]] All \[they that be\] fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.

29: 

[[Ps.22.30|30]] A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.

30: 

[[Ps.22.31|31]] They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done \[this\].

31:
