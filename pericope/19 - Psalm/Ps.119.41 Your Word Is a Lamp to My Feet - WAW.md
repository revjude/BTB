[[Ps.119|Psalm 119:41 - Psalm 119:48]]
*Your Word Is a Lamp to My Feet - WAW*

[[Ps.119.41|41]] VAU. Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, \[even\] thy salvation, according to thy word.

41: 

[[Ps.119.42|42]] So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.

42: 

[[Ps.119.43|43]] And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.

43: 

[[Ps.119.44|44]] So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.

44: 

[[Ps.119.45|45]] And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.

45: 

[[Ps.119.46|46]] I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.

46: 

[[Ps.119.47|47]] And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.

47: 

[[Ps.119.48|48]] My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.

48:
