[[Ps.80|Psalm 80:1 - Psalm 80:19]]
*Hear Us, O Shepherd of Israel*

[[Ps.80.0|0]] To the chief Musician upon ShoshannimEduth, A Psalm of Asaph.

0: 

[[Ps.80.1|1]] Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest \[between\] the cherubims, shine forth.

1: 

[[Ps.80.2|2]] Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come \[and\] save us.

2: 

[[Ps.80.3|3]] Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.

3: 

[[Ps.80.4|4]] O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?

4: 

[[Ps.80.5|5]] Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.

5: 

[[Ps.80.6|6]] Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.

6: 

[[Ps.80.7|7]] Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.

7: 

[[Ps.80.8|8]] Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.

8: 

[[Ps.80.9|9]] Thou preparedst \[room\] before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.

9: 

[[Ps.80.10|10]] The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof \[were like\] the goodly cedars.

10: 

[[Ps.80.11|11]] She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.

11: 

[[Ps.80.12|12]] Why hast thou \[then\] broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?

12: 

[[Ps.80.13|13]] The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.

13: 

[[Ps.80.14|14]] Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;

14: 

[[Ps.80.15|15]] And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch \[that\] thou madest strong for thyself.

15: 

[[Ps.80.16|16]] \[It is\] burned with fire, \[it is\] cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.

16: 

[[Ps.80.17|17]] Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man \[whom\] thou madest strong for thyself.

17: 

[[Ps.80.18|18]] So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.

18: 

[[Ps.80.19|19]] Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.

19:
