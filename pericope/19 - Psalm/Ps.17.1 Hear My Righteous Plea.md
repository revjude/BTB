[[Ps.17|Psalm 17:1 - Psalm 17:15]]
*Hear My Righteous Plea*

[[Ps.17.0|0]] A Prayer of David.

0: 

[[Ps.17.1|1]] Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, \[that goeth\] not out of feigned lips.

1: 

[[Ps.17.2|2]] Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.

2: 

[[Ps.17.3|3]] Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited \[me\] in the night; thou hast tried me, \[and\] shalt find nothing; I am purposed \[that\] my mouth shall not transgress.

3: 

[[Ps.17.4|4]] Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept \[me from\] the paths of the destroyer.

4: 

[[Ps.17.5|5]] Hold up my goings in thy paths, \[that\] my footsteps slip not.

5: 

[[Ps.17.6|6]] I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, \[and hear\] my speech.

6: 

[[Ps.17.7|7]] Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust \[in thee\] from those that rise up \[against them\].

7: 

[[Ps.17.8|8]] Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,

8: 

[[Ps.17.9|9]] From the wicked that oppress me, \[from\] my deadly enemies, \[who\] compass me about.

9: 

[[Ps.17.10|10]] They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.

10: 

[[Ps.17.11|11]] They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;

11: 

[[Ps.17.12|12]] Like as a lion \[that\] is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.

12: 

[[Ps.17.13|13]] Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, \[which is\] thy sword:

13: 

[[Ps.17.14|14]] From men \[which are\] thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, \[which have\] their portion in \[this\] life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid \[treasure\]: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their \[substance\] to their babes.

14: 

[[Ps.17.15|15]] As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.

15:
