[[Ps.57|Psalm 57:1 - Psalm 57:11]]
*In You My Soul Takes Refuge*

[[Ps.57.0|0]] To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave.

0: 

[[Ps.57.1|1]] Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until \[these\] calamities be overpast.

1: 

[[Ps.57.2|2]] I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth \[all things\] for me.

2: 

[[Ps.57.3|3]] He shall send from heaven, and save me \[from\] the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.

3: 

[[Ps.57.4|4]] My soul \[is\] among lions: \[and\] I lie \[even among\] them that are set on fire, \[even\] the sons of men, whose teeth \[are\] spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

4: 

[[Ps.57.5|5]] Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; \[let\] thy glory \[be\] above all the earth.

5: 

[[Ps.57.6|6]] They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen \[themselves\]. Selah.

6: 

[[Ps.57.7|7]] My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.

7: 

[[Ps.57.8|8]] Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I \[myself\] will awake early.

8: 

[[Ps.57.9|9]] I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations.

9: 

[[Ps.57.10|10]] For thy mercy \[is\] great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.

10: 

[[Ps.57.11|11]] Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: \[let\] thy glory \[be\] above all the earth.

11:
