[[Ps.119|Psalm 119:65 - Psalm 119:72]]
*Your Word Is a Lamp to My Feet - TETH*

[[Ps.119.65|65]] Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.

65: 

[[Ps.119.66|66]] Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.

66: 

[[Ps.119.67|67]] Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.

67: 

[[Ps.119.68|68]] Thou \[art\] good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.

68: 

[[Ps.119.69|69]] The proud have forged a lie against me: \[but\] I will keep thy precepts with \[my\] whole heart.

69: 

[[Ps.119.70|70]] Their heart is as fat as grease; \[but\] I delight in thy law.

70: 

[[Ps.119.71|71]] \[It is\] good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.

71: 

[[Ps.119.72|72]] The law of thy mouth \[is\] better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.

72:
