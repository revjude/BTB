[[Ps.78|Psalm 78:1 - Psalm 78:72]]
*I Will Open My Mouth in Parables*

[[Ps.78.0|0]] Maschil of Asaph.

0: 

[[Ps.78.1|1]] Give ear, O my people, \[to\] my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.

1: 

[[Ps.78.2|2]] I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:

2: 

[[Ps.78.3|3]] Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.

3: 

[[Ps.78.4|4]] We will not hide \[them\] from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.

4: 

[[Ps.78.5|5]] For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:

5: 

[[Ps.78.6|6]] That the generation to come might know \[them, even\] the children \[which\] should be born; \[who\] should arise and declare \[them\] to their children:

6: 

[[Ps.78.7|7]] That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:

7: 

[[Ps.78.8|8]] And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation \[that\] set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.

8: 

[[Ps.78.9|9]] The children of Ephraim, \[being\] armed, \[and\] carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.

9: 

[[Ps.78.10|10]] They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;

10: 

[[Ps.78.11|11]] And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.

11: 

[[Ps.78.12|12]] Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, \[in\] the field of Zoan.

12: 

[[Ps.78.13|13]] He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.

13: 

[[Ps.78.14|14]] In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.

14: 

[[Ps.78.15|15]] He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave \[them\] drink as \[out of\] the great depths.

15: 

[[Ps.78.16|16]] He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.

16: 

[[Ps.78.17|17]] And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.

17: 

[[Ps.78.18|18]] And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.

18: 

[[Ps.78.19|19]] Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?

19: 

[[Ps.78.20|20]] Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?

20: 

[[Ps.78.21|21]] Therefore the LORD heard \[this\], and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;

21: 

[[Ps.78.22|22]] Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:

22: 

[[Ps.78.23|23]] Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,

23: 

[[Ps.78.24|24]] And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.

24: 

[[Ps.78.25|25]] Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.

25: 

[[Ps.78.26|26]] He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.

26: 

[[Ps.78.27|27]] He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:

27: 

[[Ps.78.28|28]] And he let \[it\] fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.

28: 

[[Ps.78.29|29]] So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;

29: 

[[Ps.78.30|30]] They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat \[was\] yet in their mouths,

30: 

[[Ps.78.31|31]] The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen \[men\] of Israel.

31: 

[[Ps.78.32|32]] For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.

32: 

[[Ps.78.33|33]] Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.

33: 

[[Ps.78.34|34]] When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and inquired early after God.

34: 

[[Ps.78.35|35]] And they remembered that God \[was\] their rock, and the high God their redeemer.

35: 

[[Ps.78.36|36]] Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.

36: 

[[Ps.78.37|37]] For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.

37: 

[[Ps.78.38|38]] But he, \[being\] full of compassion, forgave \[their\] iniquity, and destroyed \[them\] not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.

38: 

[[Ps.78.39|39]] For he remembered that they \[were but\] flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.

39: 

[[Ps.78.40|40]] How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, \[and\] grieve him in the desert!

40: 

[[Ps.78.41|41]] Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.

41: 

[[Ps.78.42|42]] They remembered not his hand, \[nor\] the day when he delivered them from the enemy.

42: 

[[Ps.78.43|43]] How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:

43: 

[[Ps.78.44|44]] And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.

44: 

[[Ps.78.45|45]] He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.

45: 

[[Ps.78.46|46]] He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.

46: 

[[Ps.78.47|47]] He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.

47: 

[[Ps.78.48|48]] He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.

48: 

[[Ps.78.49|49]] He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels \[among them\].

49: 

[[Ps.78.50|50]] He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;

50: 

[[Ps.78.51|51]] And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of \[their\] strength in the tabernacles of Ham:

51: 

[[Ps.78.52|52]] But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.

52: 

[[Ps.78.53|53]] And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.

53: 

[[Ps.78.54|54]] And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, \[even to\] this mountain, \[which\] his right hand had purchased.

54: 

[[Ps.78.55|55]] He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.

55: 

[[Ps.78.56|56]] Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:

56: 

[[Ps.78.57|57]] But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.

57: 

[[Ps.78.58|58]] For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.

58: 

[[Ps.78.59|59]] When God heard \[this\], he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:

59: 

[[Ps.78.60|60]] So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent \[which\] he placed among men;

60: 

[[Ps.78.61|61]] And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand.

61: 

[[Ps.78.62|62]] He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.

62: 

[[Ps.78.63|63]] The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.

63: 

[[Ps.78.64|64]] Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.

64: 

[[Ps.78.65|65]] Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, \[and\] like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.

65: 

[[Ps.78.66|66]] And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.

66: 

[[Ps.78.67|67]] Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:

67: 

[[Ps.78.68|68]] But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.

68: 

[[Ps.78.69|69]] And he built his sanctuary like high \[palaces\], like the earth which he hath established for ever.

69: 

[[Ps.78.70|70]] He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:

70: 

[[Ps.78.71|71]] From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.

71: 

[[Ps.78.72|72]] So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
