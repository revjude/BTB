[[Ps.144|Psalm 144:1 - Psalm 144:15]]
*Blessed Be the LORD, My Rock*

[[Ps.144.0|0]] \[A Psalm\] of David.

0: 

[[Ps.144.1|1]] Blessed \[be\] the LORD my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, \[and\] my fingers to fight:

1: 

[[Ps.144.2|2]] My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and \[he\] in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.

2: 

[[Ps.144.3|3]] LORD, what \[is\] man, that thou takest knowledge of him! \[or\] the son of man, that thou makest account of him!

3: 

[[Ps.144.4|4]] Man is like to vanity: his days \[are\] as a shadow that passeth away.

4: 

[[Ps.144.5|5]] Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.

5: 

[[Ps.144.6|6]] Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.

6: 

[[Ps.144.7|7]] Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;

7: 

[[Ps.144.8|8]] Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand \[is\] a right hand of falsehood.

8: 

[[Ps.144.9|9]] I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery \[and\] an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.

9: 

[[Ps.144.10|10]] \[It is he\] that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.

10: 

[[Ps.144.11|11]] Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand \[is\] a right hand of falsehood:

11: 

[[Ps.144.12|12]] That our sons \[may be\] as plants grown up in their youth; \[that\] our daughters \[may be\] as corner stones, polished \[after\] the similitude of a palace:

12: 

[[Ps.144.13|13]] \[That\] our garners \[may be\] full, affording all manner of store: \[that\] our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:

13: 

[[Ps.144.14|14]] \[That\] our oxen \[may be\] strong to labour; \[that there be\] no breaking in, nor going out; that \[there be\] no complaining in our streets.

14: 

[[Ps.144.15|15]] Happy \[is that\] people, that is in such a case: \[yea\], happy \[is that\] people, whose God \[is\] the LORD.

15:
