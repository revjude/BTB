[[Ps.11|Psalm 11:1 - Psalm 11:7]]
*In the LORD I Take Refuge*

[[Ps.11.0|0]] To the chief Musician, \[A Psalm\] of David.

0: 

[[Ps.11.1|1]] In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee \[as\] a bird to your mountain?

1: 

[[Ps.11.2|2]] For, lo, the wicked bend \[their\] bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.

2: 

[[Ps.11.3|3]] If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?

3: 

[[Ps.11.4|4]] The LORD \[is\] in his holy temple, the LORD’S throne \[is\] in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.

4: 

[[Ps.11.5|5]] The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.

5: 

[[Ps.11.6|6]] Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: \[this shall be\] the portion of their cup.

6: 

[[Ps.11.7|7]] For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.

7:
