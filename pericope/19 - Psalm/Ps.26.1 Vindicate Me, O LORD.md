[[Ps.26|Psalm 26:1 - Psalm 26:12]]
*Vindicate Me, O LORD*

[[Ps.26.0|0]] \[A Psalm\] of David.

0: 

[[Ps.26.1|1]] Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; \[therefore\] I shall not slide.

1: 

[[Ps.26.2|2]] Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.

2: 

[[Ps.26.3|3]] For thy lovingkindness \[is\] before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.

3: 

[[Ps.26.4|4]] I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.

4: 

[[Ps.26.5|5]] I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.

5: 

[[Ps.26.6|6]] I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD:

6: 

[[Ps.26.7|7]] That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.

7: 

[[Ps.26.8|8]] LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.

8: 

[[Ps.26.9|9]] Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:

9: 

[[Ps.26.10|10]] In whose hands \[is\] mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.

10: 

[[Ps.26.11|11]] But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.

11: 

[[Ps.26.12|12]] My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.

12:
