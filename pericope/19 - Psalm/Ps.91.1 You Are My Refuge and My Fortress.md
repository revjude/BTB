[[Ps.91|Psalm 91:1 - Psalm 91:16]]
*You Are My Refuge and My Fortress*

[[Ps.91.1|1]] He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

1: 

[[Ps.91.2|2]] I will say of the LORD, \[He is\] my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.

2: 

[[Ps.91.3|3]] Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, \[and\] from the noisome pestilence.

3: 

[[Ps.91.4|4]] He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth \[shall be thy\] shield and buckler.

4: 

[[Ps.91.5|5]] Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; \[nor\] for the arrow \[that\] flieth by day;

5: 

[[Ps.91.6|6]] \[Nor\] for the pestilence \[that\] walketh in darkness; \[nor\] for the destruction \[that\] wasteth at noonday.

6: 

[[Ps.91.7|7]] A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; \[but\] it shall not come nigh thee.

7: 

[[Ps.91.8|8]] Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.

8: 

[[Ps.91.9|9]] Because thou hast made the LORD, \[which is\] my refuge, \[even\] the most High, thy habitation;

9: 

[[Ps.91.10|10]] There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.

10: 

[[Ps.91.11|11]] For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.

11: 

[[Ps.91.12|12]] They shall bear thee up in \[their\] hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.

12: 

[[Ps.91.13|13]] Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.

13: 

[[Ps.91.14|14]] Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.

14: 

[[Ps.91.15|15]] He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I \[will be\] with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.

15: 

[[Ps.91.16|16]] With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.

16:
