[[Ps.142|Psalm 142:1 - Psalm 142:7]]
*I Lift My Voice to the LORD*

[[Ps.142.0|0]] Maschil of David; A Prayer when he was in the cave.

0: 

[[Ps.142.1|1]] I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication.

1: 

[[Ps.142.2|2]] I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble.

2: 

[[Ps.142.3|3]] When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.

3: 

[[Ps.142.4|4]] I looked on \[my\] right hand, and beheld, but \[there was\] no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.

4: 

[[Ps.142.5|5]] I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou \[art\] my refuge \[and\] my portion in the land of the living.

5: 

[[Ps.142.6|6]] Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.

6: 

[[Ps.142.7|7]] Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.

7:
