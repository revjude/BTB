[[Ps.102|Psalm 102:1 - Psalm 102:28]]
*The Prayer of the Afflicted*

[[Ps.102.0|0]] A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD.

0: 

[[Ps.102.1|1]] Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.

1: 

[[Ps.102.2|2]] Hide not thy face from me in the day \[when\] I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day \[when\] I call answer me speedily.

2: 

[[Ps.102.3|3]] For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.

3: 

[[Ps.102.4|4]] My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.

4: 

[[Ps.102.5|5]] By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.

5: 

[[Ps.102.6|6]] I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.

6: 

[[Ps.102.7|7]] I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.

7: 

[[Ps.102.8|8]] Mine enemies reproach me all the day; \[and\] they that are mad against me are sworn against me.

8: 

[[Ps.102.9|9]] For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,

9: 

[[Ps.102.10|10]] Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.

10: 

[[Ps.102.11|11]] My days \[are\] like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.

11: 

[[Ps.102.12|12]] But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.

12: 

[[Ps.102.13|13]] Thou shalt arise, \[and\] have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.

13: 

[[Ps.102.14|14]] For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.

14: 

[[Ps.102.15|15]] So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.

15: 

[[Ps.102.16|16]] When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.

16: 

[[Ps.102.17|17]] He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.

17: 

[[Ps.102.18|18]] This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.

18: 

[[Ps.102.19|19]] For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;

19: 

[[Ps.102.20|20]] To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;

20: 

[[Ps.102.21|21]] To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;

21: 

[[Ps.102.22|22]] When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.

22: 

[[Ps.102.23|23]] He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.

23: 

[[Ps.102.24|24]] I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years \[are\] throughout all generations.

24: 

[[Ps.102.25|25]] Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens \[are\] the work of thy hands.

25: 

[[Ps.102.26|26]] They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:

26: 

[[Ps.102.27|27]] But thou \[art\] the same, and thy years shall have no end.

27: 

[[Ps.102.28|28]] The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.

28:
