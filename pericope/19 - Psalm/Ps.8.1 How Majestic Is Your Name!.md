*How Majestic Is Your Name!*

[[Ps.8.0|0]] To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of David.

0: 

[[Ps.8.1|1]] O LORD our Lord, how excellent \[is\] thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.

1: 

[[Ps.8.2|2]] Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.

2: 

[[Ps.8.3|3]] When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;

3: 

[[Ps.8.4|4]] What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?

4: 

[[Ps.8.5|5]] For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.

5: 

[[Ps.8.6|6]] Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all \[things\] under his feet:

6: 

[[Ps.8.7|7]] All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;

7: 

[[Ps.8.8|8]] The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, \[and whatsoever\] passeth through the paths of the seas.

8: 

[[Ps.8.9|9]] O LORD our Lord, how excellent \[is\] thy name in all the earth!

9:
