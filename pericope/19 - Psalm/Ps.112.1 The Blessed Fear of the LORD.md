[[Ps.112|Psalm 112:1 - Psalm 112:10]]
*The Blessed Fear of the LORD*

[[Ps.112.1|1]] Praise ye the LORD. Blessed \[is\] the man \[that\] feareth the LORD, \[that\] delighteth greatly in his commandments.

1: 

[[Ps.112.2|2]] His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.

2: 

[[Ps.112.3|3]] Wealth and riches \[shall be\] in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever.

3: 

[[Ps.112.4|4]] Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: \[he is\] gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.

4: 

[[Ps.112.5|5]] A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion.

5: 

[[Ps.112.6|6]] Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.

6: 

[[Ps.112.7|7]] He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.

7: 

[[Ps.112.8|8]] His heart \[is\] established, he shall not be afraid, until he see \[his desire\] upon his enemies.

8: 

[[Ps.112.9|9]] He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.

9: 

[[Ps.112.10|10]] The wicked shall see \[it\], and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.

10:
