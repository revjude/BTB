[[Ps.10|Psalm 10:1 - Psalm 10:18]]
*The Perils of the Pilgrim*

[[Ps.10.1|1]] Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? \[why\] hidest thou \[thyself\] in times of trouble?

1: 

[[Ps.10.2|2]] The wicked in \[his\] pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.

2: 

[[Ps.10.3|3]] For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, and blesseth the covetous, \[whom\] the LORD abhorreth.

3: 

[[Ps.10.4|4]] The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek \[after God\]: God \[is\] not in all his thoughts.

4: 

[[Ps.10.5|5]] His ways are always grievous; thy judgments \[are\] far above out of his sight: \[as for\] all his enemies, he puffeth at them.

5: 

[[Ps.10.6|6]] He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for \[I shall\] never \[be\] in adversity.

6: 

[[Ps.10.7|7]] His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue \[is\] mischief and vanity.

7: 

[[Ps.10.8|8]] He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.

8: 

[[Ps.10.9|9]] He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.

9: 

[[Ps.10.10|10]] He croucheth, \[and\] humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.

10: 

[[Ps.10.11|11]] He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see \[it\].

11: 

[[Ps.10.12|12]] Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.

12: 

[[Ps.10.13|13]] Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require \[it\].

13: 

[[Ps.10.14|14]] Thou hast seen \[it\]; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite \[it\] with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.

14: 

[[Ps.10.15|15]] Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil \[man\]: seek out his wickedness \[till\] thou find none.

15: 

[[Ps.10.16|16]] The LORD \[is\] King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.

16: 

[[Ps.10.17|17]] LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:

17: 

[[Ps.10.18|18]] To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.

18:
