[[Ps.141|Psalm 141:1 - Psalm 141:10]]
*Come Quickly to Me*

[[Ps.141.0|0]] A Psalm of David.

0: 

[[Ps.141.1|1]] LORD, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.

1: 

[[Ps.141.2|2]] Let my prayer be set forth before thee \[as\] incense; \[and\] the lifting up of my hands \[as\] the evening sacrifice.

2: 

[[Ps.141.3|3]] Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.

3: 

[[Ps.141.4|4]] Incline not my heart to \[any\] evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.

4: 

[[Ps.141.5|5]] Let the righteous smite me; \[it shall be\] a kindness: and let him reprove me; \[it shall be\] an excellent oil, \[which\] shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also \[shall be\] in their calamities.

5: 

[[Ps.141.6|6]] When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.

6: 

[[Ps.141.7|7]] Our bones are scattered at the grave’s mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth \[wood\] upon the earth.

7: 

[[Ps.141.8|8]] But mine eyes \[are\] unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.

8: 

[[Ps.141.9|9]] Keep me from the snares \[which\] they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.

9: 

[[Ps.141.10|10]] Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.

10:
