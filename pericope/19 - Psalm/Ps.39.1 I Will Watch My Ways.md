[[Ps.39|Psalm 39:1 - Psalm 39:13]]
*I Will Watch My Ways*

[[Ps.39.0|0]] To the chief Musician, \[even\] to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.

0: 

[[Ps.39.1|1]] I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.

1: 

[[Ps.39.2|2]] I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, \[even\] from good; and my sorrow was stirred.

2: 

[[Ps.39.3|3]] My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: \[then\] spake I with my tongue,

3: 

[[Ps.39.4|4]] LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it \[is; that\] I may know how frail I \[am\].

4: 

[[Ps.39.5|5]] Behold, thou hast made my days \[as\] an handbreadth; and mine age \[is\] as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state \[is\] altogether vanity. Selah.

5: 

[[Ps.39.6|6]] Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up \[riches\], and knoweth not who shall gather them.

6: 

[[Ps.39.7|7]] And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope \[is\] in thee.

7: 

[[Ps.39.8|8]] Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.

8: 

[[Ps.39.9|9]] I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst \[it\].

9: 

[[Ps.39.10|10]] Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.

10: 

[[Ps.39.11|11]] When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man \[is\] vanity. Selah.

11: 

[[Ps.39.12|12]] Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I \[am\] a stranger with thee, \[and\] a sojourner, as all my fathers \[were\].

12: 

[[Ps.39.13|13]] O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.

13:
