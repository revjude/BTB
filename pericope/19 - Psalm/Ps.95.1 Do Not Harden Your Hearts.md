[[Ps.95|Psalm 95:1 - Psalm 95:11]]
*Do Not Harden Your Hearts*

[[Ps.95.1|1]] O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.

1: 

[[Ps.95.2|2]] Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.

2: 

[[Ps.95.3|3]] For the LORD \[is\] a great God, and a great King above all gods.

3: 

[[Ps.95.4|4]] In his hand \[are\] the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills \[is\] his also.

4: 

[[Ps.95.5|5]] The sea \[is\] his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry \[land\].

5: 

[[Ps.95.6|6]] O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker.

6: 

[[Ps.95.7|7]] For he \[is\] our God; and we \[are\] the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,

7: 

[[Ps.95.8|8]] Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, \[and\] as \[in\] the day of temptation in the wilderness:

8: 

[[Ps.95.9|9]] When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.

9: 

[[Ps.95.10|10]] Forty years long was I grieved with \[this\] generation, and said, It \[is\] a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:

10: 

[[Ps.95.11|11]] Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.

11:
