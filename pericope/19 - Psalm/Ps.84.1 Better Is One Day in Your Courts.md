[[Ps.84|Psalm 84:1 - Psalm 84:12]]
*Better Is One Day in Your Courts*

[[Ps.84.0|0]] To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.

0: 

[[Ps.84.1|1]] How amiable \[are\] thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!

1: 

[[Ps.84.2|2]] My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.

2: 

[[Ps.84.3|3]] Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, \[even\] thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.

3: 

[[Ps.84.4|4]] Blessed \[are\] they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah.

4: 

[[Ps.84.5|5]] Blessed \[is\] the man whose strength \[is\] in thee; in whose heart \[are\] the ways \[of them\].

5: 

[[Ps.84.6|6]] \[Who\] passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.

6: 

[[Ps.84.7|7]] They go from strength to strength, \[every one of them\] in Zion appeareth before God.

7: 

[[Ps.84.8|8]] O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.

8: 

[[Ps.84.9|9]] Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.

9: 

[[Ps.84.10|10]] For a day in thy courts \[is\] better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.

10: 

[[Ps.84.11|11]] For the LORD God \[is\] a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good \[thing\] will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.

11: 

[[Ps.84.12|12]] O LORD of hosts, blessed \[is\] the man that trusteth in thee.

12:
