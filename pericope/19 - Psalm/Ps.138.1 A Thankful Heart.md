[[Ps.138.3|3]] In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, \[and\] strengthenedst me \[with\] strength in my soul.

3: 

[[Ps.138.4|4]] All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth.

4: 

[[Ps.138.5|5]] Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great \[is\] the glory of the LORD.

5: 

[[Ps.138.6|6]] Though the LORD \[be\] high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off.

[[Ps.138.7|7]] Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.
