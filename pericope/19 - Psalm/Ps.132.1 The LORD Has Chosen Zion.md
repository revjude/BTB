[[Ps.132|Psalm 132:1 - Psalm 132:18]]
*The LORD Has Chosen Zion*

[[Ps.132.0|0]] A Song of degrees.

0: 

[[Ps.132.1|1]] LORD, remember David, \[and\] all his afflictions:

1: 

[[Ps.132.2|2]] How he sware unto the LORD, \[and\] vowed unto the mighty \[God\] of Jacob;

2: 

[[Ps.132.3|3]] Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;

3: 

[[Ps.132.4|4]] I will not give sleep to mine eyes, \[or\] slumber to mine eyelids,

4: 

[[Ps.132.5|5]] Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty \[God\] of Jacob.

5: 

[[Ps.132.6|6]] Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.

6: 

[[Ps.132.7|7]] We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.

7: 

[[Ps.132.8|8]] Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.

8: 

[[Ps.132.9|9]] Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.

9: 

[[Ps.132.10|10]] For thy servant David’s sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.

10: 

[[Ps.132.11|11]] The LORD hath sworn \[in\] truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.

11: 

[[Ps.132.12|12]] If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.

12: 

[[Ps.132.13|13]] For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired \[it\] for his habitation.

13: 

[[Ps.132.14|14]] This \[is\] my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.

14: 

[[Ps.132.15|15]] I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.

15: 

[[Ps.132.16|16]] I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.

16: 

[[Ps.132.17|17]] There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.

17: 

[[Ps.132.18|18]] His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.

18:
