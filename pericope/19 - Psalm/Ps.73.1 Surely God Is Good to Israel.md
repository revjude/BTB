[[Ps.73|Psalm 73:1 - Psalm 73:28]]
*Surely God Is Good to Israel*

[[Ps.73.0|0]] A Psalm of Asaph.

0: 

[[Ps.73.1|1]] Truly God \[is\] good to Israel, \[even\] to such as are of a clean heart.

1: 

[[Ps.73.2|2]] But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.

2: 

[[Ps.73.3|3]] For I was envious at the foolish, \[when\] I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

3: 

[[Ps.73.4|4]] For \[there are\] no bands in their death: but their strength \[is\] firm.

4: 

[[Ps.73.5|5]] They \[are\] not in trouble \[as other\] men; neither are they plagued like \[other\] men.

5: 

[[Ps.73.6|6]] Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them \[as\] a garment.

6: 

[[Ps.73.7|7]] Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.

7: 

[[Ps.73.8|8]] They are corrupt, and speak wickedly \[concerning\] oppression: they speak loftily.

8: 

[[Ps.73.9|9]] They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.

9: 

[[Ps.73.10|10]] Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full \[cup\] are wrung out to them.

10: 

[[Ps.73.11|11]] And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?

11: 

[[Ps.73.12|12]] Behold, these \[are\] the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase \[in\] riches.

12: 

[[Ps.73.13|13]] Verily I have cleansed my heart \[in\] vain, and washed my hands in innocency.

13: 

[[Ps.73.14|14]] For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.

14: 

[[Ps.73.15|15]] If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend \[against\] the generation of thy children.

15: 

[[Ps.73.16|16]] When I thought to know this, it \[was\] too painful for me;

16: 

[[Ps.73.17|17]] Until I went into the sanctuary of God; \[then\] understood I their end.

17: 

[[Ps.73.18|18]] Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.

18: 

[[Ps.73.19|19]] How are they \[brought\] into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.

19: 

[[Ps.73.20|20]] As a dream when \[one\] awaketh; \[so\], O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.

20: 

[[Ps.73.21|21]] Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.

21: 

[[Ps.73.22|22]] So foolish \[was\] I, and ignorant: I was \[as\] a beast before thee.

22: 

[[Ps.73.23|23]] Nevertheless I \[am\] continually with thee: thou hast holden \[me\] by my right hand.

23: 

[[Ps.73.24|24]] Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me \[to\] glory.

24: 

[[Ps.73.25|25]] Whom have I in heaven \[but thee\]? and \[there is\] none upon earth \[that\] I desire beside thee.

25: 

[[Ps.73.26|26]] My flesh and my heart faileth: \[but\] God \[is\] the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.

26: 

[[Ps.73.27|27]] For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.

27: 

[[Ps.73.28|28]] But \[it is\] good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.

28:
