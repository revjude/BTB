[[Ps.135|Psalm 135:1 - Psalm 135:21]]
*Give Praise, O Servants of the LORD*

[[Ps.135.1|1]] Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise \[him\], O ye servants of the LORD.

1: 

[[Ps.135.2|2]] Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God,

2: 

[[Ps.135.3|3]] Praise the LORD; for the LORD \[is\] good: sing praises unto his name; for \[it is\] pleasant.

3: 

[[Ps.135.4|4]] For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, \[and\] Israel for his peculiar treasure.

4: 

[[Ps.135.5|5]] For I know that the LORD \[is\] great, and \[that\] our Lord \[is\] above all gods.

5: 

[[Ps.135.6|6]] Whatsoever the LORD pleased, \[that\] did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.

6: 

[[Ps.135.7|7]] He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.

7: 

[[Ps.135.8|8]] Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.

8: 

[[Ps.135.9|9]] \[Who\] sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.

9: 

[[Ps.135.10|10]] Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;

10: 

[[Ps.135.11|11]] Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:

11: 

[[Ps.135.12|12]] And gave their land \[for\] an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.

12: 

[[Ps.135.13|13]] Thy name, O LORD, \[endureth\] for ever; \[and\] thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.

13: 

[[Ps.135.14|14]] For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.

14: 

[[Ps.135.15|15]] The idols of the heathen \[are\] silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.

15: 

[[Ps.135.16|16]] They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;

16: 

[[Ps.135.17|17]] They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there \[any\] breath in their mouths.

17: 

[[Ps.135.18|18]] They that make them are like unto them: \[so is\] every one that trusteth in them.

18: 

[[Ps.135.19|19]] Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:

19: 

[[Ps.135.20|20]] Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.

20: 

[[Ps.135.21|21]] Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.

21:
