[[Ps.77|Psalm 77:1 - Psalm 77:20]]
*In the Day of Trouble I Sought the Lord*

[[Ps.77.0|0]] To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph.

0: 

[[Ps.77.1|1]] I cried unto God with my voice, \[even\] unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.

1: 

[[Ps.77.2|2]] In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.

2: 

[[Ps.77.3|3]] I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.

3: 

[[Ps.77.4|4]] Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.

4: 

[[Ps.77.5|5]] I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.

5: 

[[Ps.77.6|6]] I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.

6: 

[[Ps.77.7|7]] Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?

7: 

[[Ps.77.8|8]] Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth \[his\] promise fail for evermore?

8: 

[[Ps.77.9|9]] Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.

9: 

[[Ps.77.10|10]] And I said, This \[is\] my infirmity: \[but I will remember\] the years of the right hand of the most High.

10: 

[[Ps.77.11|11]] I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.

11: 

[[Ps.77.12|12]] I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.

12: 

[[Ps.77.13|13]] Thy way, O God, \[is\] in the sanctuary: who \[is so\] great a God as \[our\] God?

13: 

[[Ps.77.14|14]] Thou \[art\] the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.

14: 

[[Ps.77.15|15]] Thou hast with \[thine\] arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.

15: 

[[Ps.77.16|16]] The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.

16: 

[[Ps.77.17|17]] The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.

17: 

[[Ps.77.18|18]] The voice of thy thunder \[was\] in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.

18: 

[[Ps.77.19|19]] Thy way \[is\] in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.

19: 

[[Ps.77.20|20]] Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

20:
