[[Ps.70.0|0]] To the chief Musician, \[A Psalm\] of David, to bring to remembrance.

[[Ps.70.1|1]] \[Make haste\], O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD.

[[Ps.70.2|2]] Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.

2: 

[[Ps.70.3|3]] Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.

3: 

[[Ps.70.4|4]] Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.

4: 

[[Ps.70.5|5]] But I \[am\] poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou \[art\] my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.

5:
