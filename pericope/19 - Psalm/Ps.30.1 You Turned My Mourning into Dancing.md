[[Ps.30|Psalm 30:1 - Psalm 30:12]]
*You Turned My Mourning into Dancing*

[[Ps.30.0|0]] A Psalm \[and\] Song \[at\] the dedication of the house of David.

0: 

[[Ps.30.1|1]] I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.

1: 

[[Ps.30.2|2]] O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.

2: 

[[Ps.30.3|3]] O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.

3: 

[[Ps.30.4|4]] Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.

4: 

[[Ps.30.5|5]] For his anger \[endureth but\] a moment; in his favour \[is\] life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy \[cometh\] in the morning.

5: 

[[Ps.30.6|6]] And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.

6: 

[[Ps.30.7|7]] LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, \[and\] I was troubled.

7: 

[[Ps.30.8|8]] I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.

8: 

[[Ps.30.9|9]] What profit \[is there\] in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?

9: 

[[Ps.30.10|10]] Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.

10: 

[[Ps.30.11|11]] Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;

11: 

[[Ps.30.12|12]] To the end that \[my\] glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.

12:
