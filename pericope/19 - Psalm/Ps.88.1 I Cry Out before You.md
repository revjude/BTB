[[Ps.88|Psalm 88:1 - Psalm 88:18]]
*I Cry Out before You*

[[Ps.88.0|0]] A Song \[or\] Psalm for the sons of Korah, to the chief Musician upon Mahalath Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite.

0: 

[[Ps.88.1|1]] O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day \[and\] night before thee:

1: 

[[Ps.88.2|2]] Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;

2: 

[[Ps.88.3|3]] For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.

3: 

[[Ps.88.4|4]] I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man \[that hath\] no strength:

4: 

[[Ps.88.5|5]] Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.

5: 

[[Ps.88.6|6]] Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.

6: 

[[Ps.88.7|7]] Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted \[me\] with all thy waves. Selah.

7: 

[[Ps.88.8|8]] Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: \[I am\] shut up, and I cannot come forth.

8: 

[[Ps.88.9|9]] Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.

9: 

[[Ps.88.10|10]] Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise \[and\] praise thee? Selah.

10: 

[[Ps.88.11|11]] Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? \[or\] thy faithfulness in destruction?

11: 

[[Ps.88.12|12]] Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

12: 

[[Ps.88.13|13]] But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.

13: 

[[Ps.88.14|14]] LORD, why castest thou off my soul? \[why\] hidest thou thy face from me?

14: 

[[Ps.88.15|15]] I \[am\] afflicted and ready to die from \[my\] youth up: \[while\] I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.

15: 

[[Ps.88.16|16]] Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.

16: 

[[Ps.88.17|17]] They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.

17: 

[[Ps.88.18|18]] Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, \[and\] mine acquaintance into darkness.

18:
