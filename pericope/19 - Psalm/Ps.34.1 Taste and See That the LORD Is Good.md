[[Ps.34|Psalm 34:1 - Psalm 34:22]]
*Taste and See That the LORD Is Good*

[[Ps.34.0|0]] \[A Psalm\] of David, when he changed his behaviour before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed.

0: 

[[Ps.34.1|1]] I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise \[shall\] continually \[be\] in my mouth.

1: 

[[Ps.34.2|2]] My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear \[thereof\], and be glad.

2: 

[[Ps.34.3|3]] O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.

3: 

[[Ps.34.4|4]] I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.

4: 

[[Ps.34.5|5]] They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.

5: 

[[Ps.34.6|6]] This poor man cried, and the LORD heard \[him\], and saved him out of all his troubles.

6: 

[[Ps.34.7|7]] The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.

7: 

[[Ps.34.8|8]] O taste and see that the LORD \[is\] good: blessed \[is\] the man \[that\] trusteth in him.

8: 

[[Ps.34.9|9]] O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for \[there is\] no want to them that fear him.

9: 

[[Ps.34.10|10]] The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good \[thing\].

10: 

[[Ps.34.11|11]] Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD.

11: 

[[Ps.34.12|12]] What man \[is he that\] desireth life, \[and\] loveth \[many\] days, that he may see good?

12: 

[[Ps.34.13|13]] Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.

13: 

[[Ps.34.14|14]] Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.

14: 

[[Ps.34.15|15]] The eyes of the LORD \[are\] upon the righteous, and his ears \[are open\] unto their cry.

15: 

[[Ps.34.16|16]] The face of the LORD \[is\] against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.

16: 

[[Ps.34.17|17]] \[The righteous\] cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.

17: 

[[Ps.34.18|18]] The LORD \[is\] nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.

18: 

[[Ps.34.19|19]] Many \[are\] the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.

19: 

[[Ps.34.20|20]] He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.

20: 

[[Ps.34.21|21]] Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.

21: 

[[Ps.34.22|22]] The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.

22:
