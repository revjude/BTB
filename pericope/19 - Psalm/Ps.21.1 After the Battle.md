[[Ps.21|Psalm 21:1 - Psalm 21:13]]
*After the Battle*

[[Ps.21.0|0]] To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

0: 

[[Ps.21.1|1]] The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!

1: 

[[Ps.21.2|2]] Thou hast given him his heart’s desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.

2: 

[[Ps.21.3|3]] For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.

3: 

[[Ps.21.4|4]] He asked life of thee, \[and\] thou gavest \[it\] him, \[even\] length of days for ever and ever.

4: 

[[Ps.21.5|5]] His glory \[is\] great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.

5: 

[[Ps.21.6|6]] For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.

6: 

[[Ps.21.7|7]] For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.

7: 

[[Ps.21.8|8]] Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.

8: 

[[Ps.21.9|9]] Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.

9: 

[[Ps.21.10|10]] Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.

10: 

[[Ps.21.11|11]] For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, \[which\] they are not able \[to perform\].

11: 

[[Ps.21.12|12]] Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, \[when\] thou shalt make ready \[thine arrows\] upon thy strings against the face of them.

12: 

[[Ps.21.13|13]] Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: \[so\] will we sing and praise thy power.

13:
