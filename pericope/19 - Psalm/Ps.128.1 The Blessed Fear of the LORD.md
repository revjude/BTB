*The Blessed Fear of the LORD*

[[Ps.128.0|0]] A Song of degrees.

0: 

[[Ps.128.1|1]] Blessed \[is\] every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.

[[Ps.128.2|2]] For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy \[shalt\] thou \[be\], and \[it shall be\] well with thee.

2: 

[[Ps.128.3|3]] Thy wife \[shall be\] as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.

3: 

[[Ps.128.4|4]] Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.

4: 

[[Ps.128.5|5]] The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.

5: 

[[Ps.128.6|6]] Yea, thou shalt see thy children’s children, \[and\] peace upon Israel.

6:
