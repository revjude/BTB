[[Ps.69|Psalm 69:1 - Psalm 69:36]]
*The Waters Are up to My Neck*

[[Ps.69.0|0]] To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, \[A Psalm\] of David.

0: 

[[Ps.69.1|1]] Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto \[my\] soul.

1: 

[[Ps.69.2|2]] I sink in deep mire, where \[there is\] no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.

2: 

[[Ps.69.3|3]] I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.

3: 

[[Ps.69.4|4]] They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, \[being\] mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored \[that\] which I took not away.

4: 

[[Ps.69.5|5]] O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.

5: 

[[Ps.69.6|6]] Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.

6: 

[[Ps.69.7|7]] Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.

7: 

[[Ps.69.8|8]] I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s children.

8: 

[[Ps.69.9|9]] For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.

9: 

[[Ps.69.10|10]] When I wept, \[and chastened\] my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.

10: 

[[Ps.69.11|11]] I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.

11: 

[[Ps.69.12|12]] They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I \[was\] the song of the drunkards.

12: 

[[Ps.69.13|13]] But as for me, my prayer \[is\] unto thee, O LORD, \[in\] an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.

13: 

[[Ps.69.14|14]] Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.

14: 

[[Ps.69.15|15]] Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.

15: 

[[Ps.69.16|16]] Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness \[is\] good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.

16: 

[[Ps.69.17|17]] And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.

17: 

[[Ps.69.18|18]] Draw nigh unto my soul, \[and\] redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.

18: 

[[Ps.69.19|19]] Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries \[are\] all before thee.

19: 

[[Ps.69.20|20]] Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked \[for some\] to take pity, but \[there was\] none; and for comforters, but I found none.

20: 

[[Ps.69.21|21]] They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.

21: 

[[Ps.69.22|22]] Let their table become a snare before them: and \[that which should have been\] for \[their\] welfare, \[let it become\] a trap.

22: 

[[Ps.69.23|23]] Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.

23: 

[[Ps.69.24|24]] Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.

24: 

[[Ps.69.25|25]] Let their habitation be desolate; \[and\] let none dwell in their tents.

25: 

[[Ps.69.26|26]] For they persecute \[him\] whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.

26: 

[[Ps.69.27|27]] Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.

27: 

[[Ps.69.28|28]] Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.

28: 

[[Ps.69.29|29]] But I \[am\] poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.

29: 

[[Ps.69.30|30]] I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.

30: 

[[Ps.69.31|31]] \[This\] also shall please the LORD better than an ox \[or\] bullock that hath horns and hoofs.

31: 

[[Ps.69.32|32]] The humble shall see \[this, and\] be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.

32: 

[[Ps.69.33|33]] For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.

33: 

[[Ps.69.34|34]] Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.

34: 

[[Ps.69.35|35]] For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.

35: 

[[Ps.69.36|36]] The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.

36:
