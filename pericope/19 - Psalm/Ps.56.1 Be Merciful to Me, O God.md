[[Ps.56|Psalm 56:1 - Psalm 56:13]]
*Be Merciful to Me, O God*

[[Ps.56.0|0]] To the chief Musician upon Jonathelemrechokim, Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath.

0: 

[[Ps.56.1|1]] Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.

1: 

[[Ps.56.2|2]] Mine enemies would daily swallow \[me\] up: for \[they be\] many that fight against me, O thou most High.

2: 

[[Ps.56.3|3]] What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.

3: 

[[Ps.56.4|4]] In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.

4: 

[[Ps.56.5|5]] Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts \[are\] against me for evil.

5: 

[[Ps.56.6|6]] They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.

6: 

[[Ps.56.7|7]] Shall they escape by iniquity? in \[thine\] anger cast down the people, O God.

7: 

[[Ps.56.8|8]] Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: \[are they\] not in thy book?

8: 

[[Ps.56.9|9]] When I cry \[unto thee\], then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God \[is\] for me.

9: 

[[Ps.56.10|10]] In God will I praise \[his\] word: in the LORD will I praise \[his\] word.

10: 

[[Ps.56.11|11]] In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.

11: 

[[Ps.56.12|12]] Thy vows \[are\] upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.

12: 

[[Ps.56.13|13]] For thou hast delivered my soul from death: \[wilt\] not \[thou deliver\] my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?

13:
