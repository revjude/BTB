[[Ps.1|Psalm 1:1 - Psalm 1:6]]
*The Two Paths*

[[Ps.1.1|1]] Blessed \[is\] the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.

1: 

[[Ps.1.2|2]] But his delight \[is\] in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.

2: 

[[Ps.1.3|3]] And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.

3: 

[[Ps.1.4|4]] The ungodly \[are\] not so: but \[are\] like the chaff which the wind driveth away.

4: 

[[Ps.1.5|5]] Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

5: 

[[Ps.1.6|6]] For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.

6:
