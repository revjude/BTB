[[Ps.53|Psalm 53:1 - Psalm 53:6]]
*The Fool Says There Is No God*

[[Ps.53.0|0]] To the chief Musician upon Mahalath, Maschil, \[A Psalm\] of David.

0: 

[[Ps.53.1|1]] The fool hath said in his heart, \[There is\] no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: \[there is\] none that doeth good.

1: 

[[Ps.53.2|2]] God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were \[any\] that did understand, that did seek God.

2: 

[[Ps.53.3|3]] Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; \[there is\] none that doeth good, no, not one.

3: 

[[Ps.53.4|4]] Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people \[as\] they eat bread: they have not called upon God.

4: 

[[Ps.53.5|5]] There were they in great fear, \[where\] no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth \[against\] thee: thou hast put \[them\] to shame, because God hath despised them.

5: 

[[Ps.53.6|6]] Oh that the salvation of Israel \[were come\] out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, \[and\] Israel shall be glad.

6:
