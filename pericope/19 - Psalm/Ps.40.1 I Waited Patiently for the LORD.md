[[Ps.40|Psalm 40:1 - Psalm 40:17]]
*I Waited Patiently for the LORD*

[[Ps.40.0|0]] To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

0: 

[[Ps.40.1|1]] I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.

1: 

[[Ps.40.2|2]] He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, \[and\] established my goings.

2: 

[[Ps.40.3|3]] And he hath put a new song in my mouth, \[even\] praise unto our God: many shall see \[it\], and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.

3: 

[[Ps.40.4|4]] Blessed \[is\] that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

4: 

[[Ps.40.5|5]] Many, O LORD my God, \[are\] thy wonderful works \[which\] thou hast done, and thy thoughts \[which are\] to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: \[if\] I would declare and speak \[of them\], they are more than can be numbered.

5: 

[[Ps.40.6|6]] Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.

6: 

[[Ps.40.7|7]] Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book \[it is\] written of me,

7: 

[[Ps.40.8|8]] I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law \[is\] within my heart.

8: 

[[Ps.40.9|9]] I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.

9: 

[[Ps.40.10|10]] I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.

10: 

[[Ps.40.11|11]] Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.

11: 

[[Ps.40.12|12]] For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.

12: 

[[Ps.40.13|13]] Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.

13: 

[[Ps.40.14|14]] Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.

14: 

[[Ps.40.15|15]] Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.

15: 

[[Ps.40.16|16]] Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.

16: 

[[Ps.40.17|17]] But I \[am\] poor and needy; \[yet\] the Lord thinketh upon me: thou \[art\] my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.

17:
