[[Ps.137|Psalm 137:1 - Psalm 137:9]]
*By the Rivers of Babylon*

[[Ps.137.1|1]] By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.

1: 

[[Ps.137.2|2]] We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.

2: 

[[Ps.137.3|3]] For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us \[required of us\] mirth, \[saying\], Sing us \[one\] of the songs of Zion.

3: 

[[Ps.137.4|4]] How shall we sing the LORD’S song in a strange land?

4: 

[[Ps.137.5|5]] If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget \[her cunning\].

5: 

[[Ps.137.6|6]] If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.

6: 

[[Ps.137.7|7]] Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase \[it\], rase \[it, even\] to the foundation thereof.

7: 

[[Ps.137.8|8]] O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy \[shall he be\], that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.

8: 

[[Ps.137.9|9]] Happy \[shall he be\], that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.

9:
