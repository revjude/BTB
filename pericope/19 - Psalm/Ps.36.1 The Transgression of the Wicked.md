[[Ps.36|Psalm 36:1 - Psalm 36:12]]
*The Transgression of the Wicked*

[[Ps.36.0|0]] To the chief Musician, \[A Psalm\] of David the servant of the LORD.

0: 

[[Ps.36.1|1]] The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, \[that there is\] no fear of God before his eyes.

1: 

[[Ps.36.2|2]] For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.

2: 

[[Ps.36.3|3]] The words of his mouth \[are\] iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, \[and\] to do good.

3: 

[[Ps.36.4|4]] He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way \[that is\] not good; he abhorreth not evil.

4: 

[[Ps.36.5|5]] Thy mercy, O LORD, \[is\] in the heavens; \[and\] thy faithfulness \[reacheth\] unto the clouds.

5: 

[[Ps.36.6|6]] Thy righteousness \[is\] like the great mountains; thy judgments \[are\] a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.

6: 

[[Ps.36.7|7]] How excellent \[is\] thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.

7: 

[[Ps.36.8|8]] They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.

8: 

[[Ps.36.9|9]] For with thee \[is\] the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.

9: 

[[Ps.36.10|10]] O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.

10: 

[[Ps.36.11|11]] Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.

11: 

[[Ps.36.12|12]] There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.

12:
