[[Ps.105|Psalm 105:1 - Psalm 105:45]]
*Tell of His Wonders*

[[Ps.105.1|1]] O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.

1: 

[[Ps.105.2|2]] Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.

2: 

[[Ps.105.3|3]] Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.

3: 

[[Ps.105.4|4]] Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.

4: 

[[Ps.105.5|5]] Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;

5: 

[[Ps.105.6|6]] O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.

6: 

[[Ps.105.7|7]] He \[is\] the LORD our God: his judgments \[are\] in all the earth.

7: 

[[Ps.105.8|8]] He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word \[which\] he commanded to a thousand generations.

8: 

[[Ps.105.9|9]] Which \[covenant\] he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;

9: 

[[Ps.105.10|10]] And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, \[and\] to Israel \[for\] an everlasting covenant:

10: 

[[Ps.105.11|11]] Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:

11: 

[[Ps.105.12|12]] When they were \[but\] a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.

12: 

[[Ps.105.13|13]] When they went from one nation to another, from \[one\] kingdom to another people;

13: 

[[Ps.105.14|14]] He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;

14: 

[[Ps.105.15|15]] \[Saying\], Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

15: 

[[Ps.105.16|16]] Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.

16: 

[[Ps.105.17|17]] He sent a man before them, \[even\] Joseph, \[who\] was sold for a servant:

17: 

[[Ps.105.18|18]] Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:

18: 

[[Ps.105.19|19]] Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.

19: 

[[Ps.105.20|20]] The king sent and loosed him; \[even\] the ruler of the people, and let him go free.

20: 

[[Ps.105.21|21]] He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:

21: 

[[Ps.105.22|22]] To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.

22: 

[[Ps.105.23|23]] Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.

23: 

[[Ps.105.24|24]] And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.

24: 

[[Ps.105.25|25]] He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.

25: 

[[Ps.105.26|26]] He sent Moses his servant; \[and\] Aaron whom he had chosen.

26: 

[[Ps.105.27|27]] They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.

27: 

[[Ps.105.28|28]] He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.

28: 

[[Ps.105.29|29]] He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.

29: 

[[Ps.105.30|30]] Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.

30: 

[[Ps.105.31|31]] He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, \[and\] lice in all their coasts.

31: 

[[Ps.105.32|32]] He gave them hail for rain, \[and\] flaming fire in their land.

32: 

[[Ps.105.33|33]] He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.

33: 

[[Ps.105.34|34]] He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,

34: 

[[Ps.105.35|35]] And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.

35: 

[[Ps.105.36|36]] He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.

36: 

[[Ps.105.37|37]] He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and \[there was\] not one feeble \[person\] among their tribes.

37: 

[[Ps.105.38|38]] Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.

38: 

[[Ps.105.39|39]] He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.

39: 

[[Ps.105.40|40]] \[The people\] asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.

40: 

[[Ps.105.41|41]] He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places \[like\] a river.

41: 

[[Ps.105.42|42]] For he remembered his holy promise, \[and\] Abraham his servant.

42: 

[[Ps.105.43|43]] And he brought forth his people with joy, \[and\] his chosen with gladness:

43: 

[[Ps.105.44|44]] And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;

44: 

[[Ps.105.45|45]] That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.

45:
