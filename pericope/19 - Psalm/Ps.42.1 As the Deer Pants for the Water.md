[[Ps.42|Psalm 42:1 - Psalm 42:11]]
*As the Deer Pants for the Water*

[[Ps.42.0|0]] To the chief Musician, Maschil, for the sons of Korah.

0: 

[[Ps.42.1|1]] As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.

1: 

[[Ps.42.2|2]] My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?

2: 

[[Ps.42.3|3]] My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where \[is\] thy God?

3: 

[[Ps.42.4|4]] When I remember these \[things\], I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.

4: 

[[Ps.42.5|5]] Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and \[why\] art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him \[for\] the help of his countenance.

5: 

[[Ps.42.6|6]] O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.

6: 

[[Ps.42.7|7]] Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.

7: 

[[Ps.42.8|8]] \[Yet\] the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night his song \[shall be\] with me, \[and\] my prayer unto the God of my life.

8: 

[[Ps.42.9|9]] I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

9: 

[[Ps.42.10|10]] \[As\] with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where \[is\] thy God?

10: 

[[Ps.42.11|11]] Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, \[who is\] the health of my countenance, and my God.

11:
