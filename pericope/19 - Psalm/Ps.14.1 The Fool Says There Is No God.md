[[Ps.14|Psalm 14:1 - Psalm 14:7]]
*The Fool Says There Is No God*

[[Ps.14.0|0]] To the chief Musician, \[A Psalm\] of David.

0: 

[[Ps.14.1|1]] The fool hath said in his heart, \[There is\] no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, \[there is\] none that doeth good.

1: 

[[Ps.14.2|2]] The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, \[and\] seek God.

2: 

[[Ps.14.3|3]] They are all gone aside, they are \[all\] together become filthy: \[there is\] none that doeth good, no, not one.

3: 

[[Ps.14.4|4]] Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people \[as\] they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.

4: 

[[Ps.14.5|5]] There were they in great fear: for God \[is\] in the generation of the righteous.

5: 

[[Ps.14.6|6]] Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD \[is\] his refuge.

6: 

[[Ps.14.7|7]] Oh that the salvation of Israel \[were come\] out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, \[and\] Israel shall be glad.

7:
