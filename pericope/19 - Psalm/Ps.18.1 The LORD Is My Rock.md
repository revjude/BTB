[[Ps.18|Psalm 18:1 - Psalm 18:50]]
*The LORD Is My Rock*

[[Ps.18.0|0]] To the chief Musician, \[A Psalm\] of David, the servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day \[that\] the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said,

0: 

[[Ps.18.1|1]] I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.

1: 

[[Ps.18.2|2]] The LORD \[is\] my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, \[and\] my high tower.

2: 

[[Ps.18.3|3]] I will call upon the LORD, \[who is worthy\] to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.

3: 

[[Ps.18.4|4]] The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.

4: 

[[Ps.18.5|5]] The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.

5: 

[[Ps.18.6|6]] In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, \[even\] into his ears.

6: 

[[Ps.18.7|7]] Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.

7: 

[[Ps.18.8|8]] There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

8: 

[[Ps.18.9|9]] He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness \[was\] under his feet.

9: 

[[Ps.18.10|10]] And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.

10: 

[[Ps.18.11|11]] He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him \[were\] dark waters \[and\] thick clouds of the skies.

11: 

[[Ps.18.12|12]] At the brightness \[that was\] before him his thick clouds passed, hail \[stones\] and coals of fire.

12: 

[[Ps.18.13|13]] The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail \[stones\] and coals of fire.

13: 

[[Ps.18.14|14]] Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.

14: 

[[Ps.18.15|15]] Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.

15: 

[[Ps.18.16|16]] He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.

16: 

[[Ps.18.17|17]] He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.

17: 

[[Ps.18.18|18]] They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.

18: 

[[Ps.18.19|19]] He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.

19: 

[[Ps.18.20|20]] The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

20: 

[[Ps.18.21|21]] For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.

21: 

[[Ps.18.22|22]] For all his judgments \[were\] before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.

22: 

[[Ps.18.23|23]] I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.

23: 

[[Ps.18.24|24]] Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.

24: 

[[Ps.18.25|25]] With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;

25: 

[[Ps.18.26|26]] With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.

26: 

[[Ps.18.27|27]] For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.

27: 

[[Ps.18.28|28]] For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.

28: 

[[Ps.18.29|29]] For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.

29: 

[[Ps.18.30|30]] \[As for\] God, his way \[is\] perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he \[is\] a buckler to all those that trust in him.

30: 

[[Ps.18.31|31]] For who \[is\] God save the LORD? or who \[is\] a rock save our God?

31: 

[[Ps.18.32|32]] \[It is\] God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.

32: 

[[Ps.18.33|33]] He maketh my feet like hinds’ \[feet\], and setteth me upon my high places.

33: 

[[Ps.18.34|34]] He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.

34: 

[[Ps.18.35|35]] Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.

35: 

[[Ps.18.36|36]] Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.

36: 

[[Ps.18.37|37]] I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.

37: 

[[Ps.18.38|38]] I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.

38: 

[[Ps.18.39|39]] For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.

39: 

[[Ps.18.40|40]] Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.

40: 

[[Ps.18.41|41]] They cried, but \[there was\] none to save \[them: even\] unto the LORD, but he answered them not.

41: 

[[Ps.18.42|42]] Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.

42: 

[[Ps.18.43|43]] Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; \[and\] thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people \[whom\] I have not known shall serve me.

43: 

[[Ps.18.44|44]] As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.

44: 

[[Ps.18.45|45]] The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.

45: 

[[Ps.18.46|46]] The LORD liveth; and blessed \[be\] my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.

46: 

[[Ps.18.47|47]] \[It is\] God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.

47: 

[[Ps.18.48|48]] He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.

48: 

[[Ps.18.49|49]] Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.

49: 

[[Ps.18.50|50]] Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.

50:
