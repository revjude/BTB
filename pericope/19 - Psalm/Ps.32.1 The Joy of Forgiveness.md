[[Ps.32|Psalm 32:1 - Psalm 32:11]]
*The Joy of Forgiveness*

[[Ps.32.0|0]] \[A Psalm\] of David, Maschil.

0: 

[[Ps.32.1|1]] Blessed \[is he whose\] transgression \[is\] forgiven, \[whose\] sin \[is\] covered.

1: 

[[Ps.32.2|2]] Blessed \[is\] the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit \[there is\] no guile.

2: 

[[Ps.32.3|3]] When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.

3: 

[[Ps.32.4|4]] For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.

4: 

[[Ps.32.5|5]] I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.

5: 

[[Ps.32.6|6]] For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.

6: 

[[Ps.32.7|7]] Thou \[art\] my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.

7: 

[[Ps.32.8|8]] I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.

8: 

[[Ps.32.9|9]] Be ye not as the horse, \[or\] as the mule, \[which\] have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.

9: 

[[Ps.32.10|10]] Many sorrows \[shall be\] to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.

10: 

[[Ps.32.11|11]] Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all \[ye that are\] upright in heart.

11:
