[[Ps.12|Psalm 12:1 - Psalm 12:8]]
*The Godly Are No More*

[[Ps.12.0|0]] To the chief Musician upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.

0: 

[[Ps.12.1|1]] Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.

1: 

[[Ps.12.2|2]] They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: \[with\] flattering lips \[and\] with a double heart do they speak.

2: 

[[Ps.12.3|3]] The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, \[and\] the tongue that speaketh proud things:

3: 

[[Ps.12.4|4]] Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips \[are\] our own: who \[is\] lord over us?

4: 

[[Ps.12.5|5]] For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set \[him\] in safety \[from him that\] puffeth at him.

5: 

[[Ps.12.6|6]] The words of the LORD \[are\] pure words: \[as\] silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.

6: 

[[Ps.12.7|7]] Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.

7: 

[[Ps.12.8|8]] The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.

8:
