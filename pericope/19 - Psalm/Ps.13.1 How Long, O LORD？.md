[[Ps.13|Psalm 13:1 - Psalm 13:6]]
*How Long, O LORD？*

[[Ps.13.0|0]] To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

0: 

[[Ps.13.1|1]] How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?

1: 

[[Ps.13.2|2]] How long shall I take counsel in my soul, \[having\] sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?

2: 

[[Ps.13.3|3]] Consider \[and\] hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the \[sleep of\] death;

3: 

[[Ps.13.4|4]] Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; \[and\] those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.

4: 

[[Ps.13.5|5]] But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.

5: 

[[Ps.13.6|6]] I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.

6:
