[[Amos.7|Amos 7:1 - Amos 7:9]]
*The Locusts, Fire, and Plumb Line*

[[Amos.7.1|1]] Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, \[it was\] the latter growth after the king’s mowings.

1: 

[[Amos.7.2|2]] And it came to pass, \[that\] when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he \[is\] small.

2: 

[[Amos.7.3|3]] The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.

3: 

[[Amos.7.4|4]] Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.

4: 

[[Amos.7.5|5]] Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he \[is\] small.

5: 

[[Amos.7.6|6]] The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.

6: 

[[Amos.7.7|7]] Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall \[made\] by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.

7: 

[[Amos.7.8|8]] And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:

8: 

[[Amos.7.9|9]] And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.

9:
