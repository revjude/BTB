[[Amos.5|Amos 5:4 - Amos 5:15]]
*A Call to Repentance*

[[Amos.5.4|4]] For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live:

4: 

[[Amos.5.5|5]] But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought.

5: 

[[Amos.5.6|6]] Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour \[it\], and \[there be\] none to quench \[it\] in Bethel.

6: 

[[Amos.5.7|7]] Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,

7: 

[[Amos.5.8|8]] \[Seek him\] that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD \[is\] his name:

8: 

[[Amos.5.9|9]] That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.

9: 

[[Amos.5.10|10]] They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.

10: 

[[Amos.5.11|11]] Forasmuch therefore as your treading \[is\] upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.

11: 

[[Amos.5.12|12]] For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate \[from their right\].

12: 

[[Amos.5.13|13]] Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it \[is\] an evil time.

13: 

[[Amos.5.14|14]] Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.

14: 

[[Amos.5.15|15]] Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.

15:
