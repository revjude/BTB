[[Amos.7|Amos 7:10 - Amos 7:17]]
*Amaziah Accuses Amos*

[[Amos.7.10|10]] Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.

10: 

[[Amos.7.11|11]] For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.

11: 

[[Amos.7.12|12]] Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:

12: 

[[Amos.7.13|13]] But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it \[is\] the king’s chapel, and it \[is\] the king’s court.

13: 

[[Amos.7.14|14]] Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I \[was\] no prophet, neither \[was\] I a prophet’s son; but I \[was\] an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:

14: 

[[Amos.7.15|15]] And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.

15: 

[[Amos.7.16|16]] Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not \[thy word\] against the house of Isaac.

16: 

[[Amos.7.17|17]] Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.

17:
