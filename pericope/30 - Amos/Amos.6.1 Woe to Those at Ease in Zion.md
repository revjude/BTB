[[Amos.6|Amos 6:1 - Amos 6:7]]
*Woe to Those at Ease in Zion*

[[Amos.6.1|1]] Woe to them \[that are\] at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, \[which are\] named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!

1: 

[[Amos.6.2|2]] Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: \[be they\] better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?

2: 

[[Amos.6.3|3]] Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;

3: 

[[Amos.6.4|4]] That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;

4: 

[[Amos.6.5|5]] That chant to the sound of the viol, \[and\] invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David;

5: 

[[Amos.6.6|6]] That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.

6: 

[[Amos.6.7|7]] Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.

7:
