[[Amos.6|Amos 6:8 - Amos 6:14]]
*The Pride of Israel*

[[Amos.6.8|8]] The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.

8: 

[[Amos.6.9|9]] And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.

9: 

[[Amos.6.10|10]] And a man’s uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that \[is\] by the sides of the house, \[Is there\] yet \[any\] with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.

10: 

[[Amos.6.11|11]] For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.

11: 

[[Amos.6.12|12]] Shall horses run upon the rock? will \[one\] plow \[there\] with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:

12: 

[[Amos.6.13|13]] Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?

13: 

[[Amos.6.14|14]] But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness.

14:
