[[Amos.4|Amos 4:1 - Amos 4:13]]
*Punishment Brings No Repentance*

[[Amos.4.1|1]] Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that \[are\] in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.

1: 

[[Amos.4.2|2]] The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.

2: 

[[Amos.4.3|3]] And ye shall go out at the breaches, every \[cow at that which is\] before her; and ye shall cast \[them\] into the palace, saith the LORD.

3: 

[[Amos.4.4|4]] Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, \[and\] your tithes after three years:

4: 

[[Amos.4.5|5]] And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim \[and\] publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.

5: 

[[Amos.4.6|6]] And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.

6: 

[[Amos.4.7|7]] And also I have withholden the rain from you, when \[there were\] yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.

7: 

[[Amos.4.8|8]] So two \[or\] three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.

8: 

[[Amos.4.9|9]] I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured \[them\]: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.

9: 

[[Amos.4.10|10]] I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.

10: 

[[Amos.4.11|11]] I have overthrown \[some\] of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.

11: 

[[Amos.4.12|12]] Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: \[and\] because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.

12: 

[[Amos.4.13|13]] For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what \[is\] his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, \[is\] his name.

13:
