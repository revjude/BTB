[[Amos.2|Amos 2:1 - Amos 2:16]]
*Judgment on Moab, Judah, and Israel*

[[Amos.2.1|1]] Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away \[the punishment\] thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:

1: 

[[Amos.2.2|2]] But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, \[and\] with the sound of the trumpet:

2: 

[[Amos.2.3|3]] And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.

3: 

[[Amos.2.4|4]] Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away \[the punishment\] thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:

4: 

[[Amos.2.5|5]] But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.

5: 

[[Amos.2.6|6]] Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away \[the punishment\] thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;

6: 

[[Amos.2.7|7]] That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the \[same\] maid, to profane my holy name:

7: 

[[Amos.2.8|8]] And they lay \[themselves\] down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned \[in\] the house of their god.

8: 

[[Amos.2.9|9]] Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height \[was\] like the height of the cedars, and he \[was\] strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.

9: 

[[Amos.2.10|10]] Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.

10: 

[[Amos.2.11|11]] And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. \[Is it\] not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.

11: 

[[Amos.2.12|12]] But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.

12: 

[[Amos.2.13|13]] Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed \[that is\] full of sheaves.

13: 

[[Amos.2.14|14]] Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:

14: 

[[Amos.2.15|15]] Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and \[he that is\] swift of foot shall not deliver \[himself\]: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.

15: 

[[Amos.2.16|16]] And \[he that is\] courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.

16:
