[[Amos.9|Amos 9:1 - Amos 9:10]]
*The Destruction of Israel*

[[Amos.9.1|1]] I saw the Lord standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.

1: 

[[Amos.9.2|2]] Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down:

2: 

[[Amos.9.3|3]] And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:

3: 

[[Amos.9.4|4]] And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.

4: 

[[Amos.9.5|5]] And the Lord GOD of hosts \[is\] he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as \[by\] the flood of Egypt.

5: 

[[Amos.9.6|6]] \[It is\] he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD \[is\] his name.

6: 

[[Amos.9.7|7]] \[Are\] ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?

7: 

[[Amos.9.8|8]] Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD \[are\] upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.

8: 

[[Amos.9.9|9]] For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as \[corn\] is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.

9: 

[[Amos.9.10|10]] All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.

10:
