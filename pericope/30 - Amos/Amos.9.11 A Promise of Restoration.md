[[Amos.9|Amos 9:11 - Amos 9:15]]
*A Promise of Restoration*

[[Amos.9.11|11]] In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:

11: 

[[Amos.9.12|12]] That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my name, saith the LORD that doeth this.

12: 

[[Amos.9.13|13]] Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.

13: 

[[Amos.9.14|14]] And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit \[them\]; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.

14: 

[[Amos.9.15|15]] And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the LORD thy God.

15:
