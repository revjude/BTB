[[Amos.5|Amos 5:1 - Amos 5:3]]
*A Lamentation against Israel*

[[Amos.5.1|1]] Hear ye this word which I take up against you, \[even\] a lamentation, O house of Israel.

1: 

[[Amos.5.2|2]] The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; \[there is\] none to raise her up.

2: 

[[Amos.5.3|3]] For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out \[by\] a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth \[by\] an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.

3:
