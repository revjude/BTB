[[Amos.5|Amos 5:16 - Amos 5:27]]
*Woe to Rebellious Israel*

[[Amos.5.16|16]] Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing \[shall be\] in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.

16: 

[[Amos.5.17|17]] And in all vineyards \[shall be\] wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD.

17: 

[[Amos.5.18|18]] Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end \[is\] it for you? the day of the LORD \[is\] darkness, and not light.

18: 

[[Amos.5.19|19]] As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.

19: 

[[Amos.5.20|20]] \[Shall\] not the day of the LORD \[be\] darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?

20: 

[[Amos.5.21|21]] I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.

21: 

[[Amos.5.22|22]] Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept \[them\]: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.

22: 

[[Amos.5.23|23]] Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.

23: 

[[Amos.5.24|24]] But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.

24: 

[[Amos.5.25|25]] Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?

25: 

[[Amos.5.26|26]] But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.

26: 

[[Amos.5.27|27]] Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name \[is\] The God of hosts.

27:
