[[Jonah.1|Jonah 1:4 - Jonah 1:10]]
*The Great Storm*

[[Jonah.1.4|4]] But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.

4: 

[[Jonah.1.5|5]] Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that \[were\] in the ship into the sea, to lighten \[it\] of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.

5: 

[[Jonah.1.6|6]] So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.

6: 

[[Jonah.1.7|7]] And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil \[is\] upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.

7: 

[[Jonah.1.8|8]] Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil \[is\] upon us; What \[is\] thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what \[is\] thy country? and of what people \[art\] thou?

8: 

[[Jonah.1.9|9]] And he said unto them, I \[am\] an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry \[land\].

9: 

[[Jonah.1.10|10]] Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.

10:
