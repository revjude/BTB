[[Jonah.1|Jonah 1:11 - Jonah 1:17]]
*Jonah Cast into the Sea*

[[Jonah.1.11|11]] Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.

11: 

[[Jonah.1.12|12]] And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest \[is\] upon you.

12: 

[[Jonah.1.13|13]] Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring \[it\] to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.

13: 

[[Jonah.1.14|14]] Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee.

14: 

[[Jonah.1.15|15]] So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.

15: 

[[Jonah.1.16|16]] Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows.

16: 

[[Jonah.1.17|17]] Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
