[[Jonah.2|Jonah 2:1 - Jonah 2:10]]
*Jonah’s Prayer*

[[Jonah.2.1|1]] Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish’s belly,

1: 

[[Jonah.2.2|2]] And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, \[and\] thou heardest my voice.

2: 

[[Jonah.2.3|3]] For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.

3: 

[[Jonah.2.4|4]] Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.

4: 

[[Jonah.2.5|5]] The waters compassed me about, \[even\] to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.

5: 

[[Jonah.2.6|6]] I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars \[was\] about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.

6: 

[[Jonah.2.7|7]] When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.

7: 

[[Jonah.2.8|8]] They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.

8: 

[[Jonah.2.9|9]] But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay \[that\] that I have vowed. Salvation \[is\] of the LORD.

9: 

[[Jonah.2.10|10]] And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry \[land\].

10:
