[[Jonah.4|Jonah 4:1 - Jonah 4:11]]
*Jonah’s Anger at the LORD’s Compassion*

[[Jonah.4.1|1]] But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.

1: 

[[Jonah.4.2|2]] And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, \[was\] not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou \[art\] a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.

2: 

[[Jonah.4.3|3]] Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for \[it is\] better for me to die than to live.

3: 

[[Jonah.4.4|4]] Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?

4: 

[[Jonah.4.5|5]] So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.

5: 

[[Jonah.4.6|6]] And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made \[it\] to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.

6: 

[[Jonah.4.7|7]] But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.

7: 

[[Jonah.4.8|8]] And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, \[It is\] better for me to die than to live.

8: 

[[Jonah.4.9|9]] And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, \[even\] unto death.

9: 

[[Jonah.4.10|10]] Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:

10: 

[[Jonah.4.11|11]] And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and \[also\] much cattle?

11:
