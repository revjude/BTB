[[Eccl.7|Ecclesiastes 7:15 - Ecclesiastes 7:29]]
*The Limits of Human Wisdom*

[[Eccl.7.15|15]] All \[things\] have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just \[man\] that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked \[man\] that prolongeth \[his life\] in his wickedness.

15: 

[[Eccl.7.16|16]] Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?

16: 

[[Eccl.7.17|17]] Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?

17: 

[[Eccl.7.18|18]] \[It is\] good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.

18: 

[[Eccl.7.19|19]] Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty \[men\] which are in the city.

19: 

[[Eccl.7.20|20]] For \[there is\] not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.

20: 

[[Eccl.7.21|21]] Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:

21: 

[[Eccl.7.22|22]] For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.

22: 

[[Eccl.7.23|23]] All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it \[was\] far from me.

23: 

[[Eccl.7.24|24]] That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?

24: 

[[Eccl.7.25|25]] I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason \[of things\], and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness \[and\] madness:

25: 

[[Eccl.7.26|26]] And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart \[is\] snares and nets, \[and\] her hands \[as\] bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.

26: 

[[Eccl.7.27|27]] Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, \[counting\] one by one, to find out the account:

27: 

[[Eccl.7.28|28]] Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.

28: 

[[Eccl.7.29|29]] Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.
