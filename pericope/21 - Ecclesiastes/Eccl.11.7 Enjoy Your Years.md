[[Eccl.11|Ecclesiastes 11:7 - Ecclesiastes 11:10]]
*Enjoy Your Years*

[[Eccl.11.7|7]] Truly the light \[is\] sweet, and a pleasant \[thing it is\] for the eyes to behold the sun:

7: 

[[Eccl.11.8|8]] But if a man live many years, \[and\] rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh \[is\] vanity.

8: 

[[Eccl.11.9|9]] Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these \[things\] God will bring thee into judgment.

9: 

[[Eccl.11.10|10]] Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth \[are\] vanity.

10:
