[[Eccl.8|Ecclesiastes 8:14 - Ecclesiastes 8:17]]
*God’s Ways Are Mysterious*

[[Eccl.8.14|14]] There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just \[men\], unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked \[men\], to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also \[is\] vanity.

14: 

[[Eccl.8.15|15]] Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.

15: 

[[Eccl.8.16|16]] When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also \[there is that\] neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)

16: 

[[Eccl.8.17|17]] Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek \[it\] out, yet he shall not find \[it\]; yea further; though a wise \[man\] think to know \[it\], yet shall he not be able to find \[it\].

17:
