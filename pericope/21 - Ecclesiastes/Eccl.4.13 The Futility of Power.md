[[Eccl.4|Ecclesiastes 4:13 - Ecclesiastes 4:16]]
*The Futility of Power*

[[Eccl.4.13|13]] Better \[is\] a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.

13: 

[[Eccl.4.14|14]] For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also \[he that is\] born in his kingdom becometh poor.

14: 

[[Eccl.4.15|15]] I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.

15: 

[[Eccl.4.16|16]] \[There is\] no end of all the people, \[even\] of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also \[is\] vanity and vexation of spirit.

16:
