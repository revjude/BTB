[[Eccl.7|Ecclesiastes 7:1 - Ecclesiastes 7:14]]
*The Value of Wisdom*

[[Eccl.7.1|1]] A good name \[is\] better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one’s birth.

1: 

[[Eccl.7.2|2]] \[It is\] better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that \[is\] the end of all men; and the living will lay \[it\] to his heart.

2: 

[[Eccl.7.3|3]] Sorrow \[is\] better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.

3: 

[[Eccl.7.4|4]] The heart of the wise \[is\] in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools \[is\] in the house of mirth.

4: 

[[Eccl.7.5|5]] \[It is\] better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.

5: 

[[Eccl.7.6|6]] For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so \[is\] the laughter of the fool: this also \[is\] vanity.

6: 

[[Eccl.7.7|7]] Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.

7: 

[[Eccl.7.8|8]] Better \[is\] the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: \[and\] the patient in spirit \[is\] better than the proud in spirit.

8: 

[[Eccl.7.9|9]] Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.

9: 

[[Eccl.7.10|10]] Say not thou, What is \[the cause\] that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.

10: 

[[Eccl.7.11|11]] Wisdom \[is\] good with an inheritance: and \[by it there is\] profit to them that see the sun.

11: 

[[Eccl.7.12|12]] For wisdom \[is\] a defence, \[and\] money \[is\] a defence: but the excellency of knowledge \[is, that\] wisdom giveth life to them that have it.

12: 

[[Eccl.7.13|13]] Consider the work of God: for who can make \[that\] straight, which he hath made crooked?

13: 

[[Eccl.7.14|14]] In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.

14:
