[[Eccl.3|Ecclesiastes 3:9 - Ecclesiastes 3:15]]
*God’s Works Remain Forever*

[[Eccl.3.9|9]] What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?

9: 

[[Eccl.3.10|10]] I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.

10: 

[[Eccl.3.11|11]] He hath made every \[thing\] beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.

11: 

[[Eccl.3.12|12]] I know that \[there is\] no good in them, but for \[a man\] to rejoice, and to do good in his life.

12: 

[[Eccl.3.13|13]] And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it \[is\] the gift of God.

13: 

[[Eccl.3.14|14]] I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth \[it\], that \[men\] should fear before him.

14: 

[[Eccl.3.15|15]] That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.

15:
