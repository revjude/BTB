[[Eccl.3|Ecclesiastes 3:16 - Ecclesiastes 3:22]]
*From Dust to Dust*

[[Eccl.3.16|16]] And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, \[that\] wickedness \[was\] there; and the place of righteousness, \[that\] iniquity \[was\] there.

16: 

[[Eccl.3.17|17]] I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for \[there is\] a time there for every purpose and for every work.

17: 

[[Eccl.3.18|18]] I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.

18: 

[[Eccl.3.19|19]] For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all \[is\] vanity.

19: 

[[Eccl.3.20|20]] All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.

20: 

[[Eccl.3.21|21]] Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?

21: 

[[Eccl.3.22|22]] Wherefore I perceive that \[there is\] nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that \[is\] his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?

22:
