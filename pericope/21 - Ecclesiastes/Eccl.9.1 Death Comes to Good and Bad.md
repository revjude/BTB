[[Eccl.9|Ecclesiastes 9:1 - Ecclesiastes 9:6]]
*Death Comes to Good and Bad*

[[Eccl.9.1|1]] For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, \[are\] in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred \[by\] all \[that is\] before them.

1: 

[[Eccl.9.2|2]] All \[things come\] alike to all: \[there is\] one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as \[is\] the good, so \[is\] the sinner; \[and\] he that sweareth, as \[he\] that feareth an oath.

2: 

[[Eccl.9.3|3]] This \[is\] an evil among all \[things\] that are done under the sun, that \[there is\] one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness \[is\] in their heart while they live, and after that \[they go\] to the dead.

3: 

[[Eccl.9.4|4]] For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.

4: 

[[Eccl.9.5|5]] For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.

5: 

[[Eccl.9.6|6]] Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any \[thing\] that is done under the sun.

6:
