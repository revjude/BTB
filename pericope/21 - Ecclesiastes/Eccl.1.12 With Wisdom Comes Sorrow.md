[[Eccl.1|Ecclesiastes 1:12 - Ecclesiastes 1:18]]
*With Wisdom Comes Sorrow*

[[Eccl.1.12|12]] I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.

12: 

[[Eccl.1.13|13]] And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all \[things\] that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.

13: 

[[Eccl.1.14|14]] I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all \[is\] vanity and vexation of spirit.

14: 

[[Eccl.1.15|15]] \[That which is\] crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.

15: 

[[Eccl.1.16|16]] I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all \[they\] that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.

16: 

[[Eccl.1.17|17]] And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.

17: 

[[Eccl.1.18|18]] For in much wisdom \[is\] much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.

18:
