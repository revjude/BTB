[[Eccl.10|Ecclesiastes 10:1 - Ecclesiastes 10:20]]
*Wisdom and Folly*

[[Eccl.10.1|1]] Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: \[so doth\] a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom \[and\] honour.

1: 

[[Eccl.10.2|2]] A wise man’s heart \[is\] at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his left.

2: 

[[Eccl.10.3|3]] Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth \[him\], and he saith to every one \[that\] he \[is\] a fool.

3: 

[[Eccl.10.4|4]] If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.

4: 

[[Eccl.10.5|5]] There is an evil \[which\] I have seen under the sun, as an error \[which\] proceedeth from the ruler:

5: 

[[Eccl.10.6|6]] Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.

6: 

[[Eccl.10.7|7]] I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.

7: 

[[Eccl.10.8|8]] He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.

8: 

[[Eccl.10.9|9]] Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; \[and\] he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.

9: 

[[Eccl.10.10|10]] If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom \[is\] profitable to direct.

10: 

[[Eccl.10.11|11]] Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.

11: 

[[Eccl.10.12|12]] The words of a wise man’s mouth \[are\] gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.

12: 

[[Eccl.10.13|13]] The beginning of the words of his mouth \[is\] foolishness: and the end of his talk \[is\] mischievous madness.

13: 

[[Eccl.10.14|14]] A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?

14: 

[[Eccl.10.15|15]] The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.

15: 

[[Eccl.10.16|16]] Woe to thee, O land, when thy king \[is\] a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!

16: 

[[Eccl.10.17|17]] Blessed \[art\] thou, O land, when thy king \[is\] the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!

17: 

[[Eccl.10.18|18]] By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.

18: 

[[Eccl.10.19|19]] A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all \[things\].

19: 

[[Eccl.10.20|20]] Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.

20:
