[[Eccl.11|Ecclesiastes 11:1 - Ecclesiastes 11:6]]
*Cast Your Bread upon the Waters*

[[Eccl.11.1|1]] Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.

1: 

[[Eccl.11.2|2]] Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.

2: 

[[Eccl.11.3|3]] If the clouds be full of rain, they empty \[themselves\] upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.

3: 

[[Eccl.11.4|4]] He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.

4: 

[[Eccl.11.5|5]] As thou knowest not what \[is\] the way of the spirit, \[nor\] how the bones \[do grow\] in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.

5: 

[[Eccl.11.6|6]] In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both \[shall be\] alike good.

6:
