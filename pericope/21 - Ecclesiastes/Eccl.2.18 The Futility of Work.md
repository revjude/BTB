[[Eccl.2|Ecclesiastes 2:18 - Ecclesiastes 2:26]]
*The Futility of Work*

[[Eccl.2.18|18]] Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.

18: 

[[Eccl.2.19|19]] And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise \[man\] or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This \[is\] also vanity.

19: 

[[Eccl.2.20|20]] Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.

20: 

[[Eccl.2.21|21]] For there is a man whose labour \[is\] in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it \[for\] his portion. This also \[is\] vanity and a great evil.

21: 

[[Eccl.2.22|22]] For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?

22: 

[[Eccl.2.23|23]] For all his days \[are\] sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.

23: 

[[Eccl.2.24|24]] \[There is\] nothing better for a man, \[than\] that he should eat and drink, and \[that\] he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it \[was\] from the hand of God.

24: 

[[Eccl.2.25|25]] For who can eat, or who else can hasten \[hereunto\], more than I?

25: 

[[Eccl.2.26|26]] For \[God\] giveth to a man that \[is\] good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to \[him that is\] good before God. This also \[is\] vanity and vexation of spirit.
