[[Eccl.12|Ecclesiastes 12:9 - Ecclesiastes 12:14]]
*The Whole Duty of Man*

[[Eccl.12.9|9]] And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, \[and\] set in order many proverbs.

9: 

[[Eccl.12.10|10]] The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and \[that which was\] written \[was\] upright, \[even\] words of truth.

10: 

[[Eccl.12.11|11]] The words of the wise \[are\] as goads, and as nails fastened \[by\] the masters of assemblies, \[which\] are given from one shepherd.

11: 

[[Eccl.12.12|12]] And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books \[there is\] no end; and much study \[is\] a weariness of the flesh.

12: 

[[Eccl.12.13|13]] Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this \[is\] the whole \[duty\] of man.

13: 

[[Eccl.12.14|14]] For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether \[it be\] good, or whether \[it be\] evil.

14:
