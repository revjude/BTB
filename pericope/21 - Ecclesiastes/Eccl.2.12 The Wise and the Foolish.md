[[Eccl.2|Ecclesiastes 2:12 - Ecclesiastes 2:17]]
*The Wise and the Foolish*

[[Eccl.2.12|12]] And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what \[can\] the man \[do\] that cometh after the king? \[even\] that which hath been already done.

12: 

[[Eccl.2.13|13]] Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.

13: 

[[Eccl.2.14|14]] The wise man’s eyes \[are\] in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.

14: 

[[Eccl.2.15|15]] Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also \[is\] vanity.

15: 

[[Eccl.2.16|16]] For \[there is\] no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now \[is\] in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise \[man\]? as the fool.

16: 

[[Eccl.2.17|17]] Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun \[is\] grievous unto me: for all \[is\] vanity and vexation of spirit.

17:
