[[Eccl.8|Ecclesiastes 8:1 - Ecclesiastes 8:9]]
*Obey the King*

[[Eccl.8.1|1]] Who \[is\] as the wise \[man\]? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.

1: 

[[Eccl.8.2|2]] I \[counsel thee\] to keep the king’s commandment, and \[that\] in regard of the oath of God.

2: 

[[Eccl.8.3|3]] Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.

3: 

[[Eccl.8.4|4]] Where the word of a king \[is, there is\] power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?

4: 

[[Eccl.8.5|5]] Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man’s heart discerneth both time and judgment.

5: 

[[Eccl.8.6|6]] Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man \[is\] great upon him.

6: 

[[Eccl.8.7|7]] For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?

7: 

[[Eccl.8.8|8]] \[There is\] no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither \[hath he\] power in the day of death: and \[there is\] no discharge in \[that\] war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.

8: 

[[Eccl.8.9|9]] All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: \[there is\] a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.

9:
