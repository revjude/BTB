[[Eccl.2|Ecclesiastes 2:1 - Ecclesiastes 2:11]]
*The Futility of Pleasure*

[[Eccl.2.1|1]] I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also \[is\] vanity.

1: 

[[Eccl.2.2|2]] I said of laughter, \[It is\] mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?

2: 

[[Eccl.2.3|3]] I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what \[was\] that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.

3: 

[[Eccl.2.4|4]] I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:

4: 

[[Eccl.2.5|5]] I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all \[kind of\] fruits:

5: 

[[Eccl.2.6|6]] I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:

6: 

[[Eccl.2.7|7]] I got \[me\] servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:

7: 

[[Eccl.2.8|8]] I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, \[as\] musical instruments, and that of all sorts.

8: 

[[Eccl.2.9|9]] So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.

9: 

[[Eccl.2.10|10]] And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.

10: 

[[Eccl.2.11|11]] Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all \[was\] vanity and vexation of spirit, and \[there was\] no profit under the sun.

11:
