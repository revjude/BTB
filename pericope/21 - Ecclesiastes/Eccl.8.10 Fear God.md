[[Eccl.8|Ecclesiastes 8:10 - Ecclesiastes 8:13]]
*Fear God*

[[Eccl.8.10|10]] And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this \[is\] also vanity.

10: 

[[Eccl.8.11|11]] Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.

11: 

[[Eccl.8.12|12]] Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his \[days\] be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:

12: 

[[Eccl.8.13|13]] But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong \[his\] days, \[which are\] as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.

13:
