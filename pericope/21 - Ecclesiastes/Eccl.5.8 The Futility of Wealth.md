[[Eccl.5|Ecclesiastes 5:8 - Ecclesiastes 5:20]]
*The Futility of Wealth*

[[Eccl.5.8|8]] If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for \[he that is\] higher than the highest regardeth; and \[there be\] higher than they.

8: 

[[Eccl.5.9|9]] Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king \[himself\] is served by the field.

9: 

[[Eccl.5.10|10]] He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this \[is\] also vanity.

10: 

[[Eccl.5.11|11]] When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good \[is there\] to the owners thereof, saving the beholding \[of them\] with their eyes?

11: 

[[Eccl.5.12|12]] The sleep of a labouring man \[is\] sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.

12: 

[[Eccl.5.13|13]] There is a sore evil \[which\] I have seen under the sun, \[namely\], riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.

13: 

[[Eccl.5.14|14]] But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and \[there is\] nothing in his hand.

14: 

[[Eccl.5.15|15]] As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.

15: 

[[Eccl.5.16|16]] And this also \[is\] a sore evil, \[that\] in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?

16: 

[[Eccl.5.17|17]] All his days also he eateth in darkness, and \[he hath\] much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.

17: 

[[Eccl.5.18|18]] Behold \[that\] which I have seen: \[it is\] good and comely \[for one\] to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it \[is\] his portion.

18: 

[[Eccl.5.19|19]] Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this \[is\] the gift of God.

19: 

[[Eccl.5.20|20]] For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth \[him\] in the joy of his heart.

20:
