[[Eccl.9|Ecclesiastes 9:7 - Ecclesiastes 9:12]]
*Enjoy Your Portion in This Life*

[[Eccl.9.7|7]] Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.

7: 

[[Eccl.9.8|8]] Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.

8: 

[[Eccl.9.9|9]] Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that \[is\] thy portion in \[this\] life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.

9: 

[[Eccl.9.10|10]] Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do \[it\] with thy might; for \[there is\] no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.

10: 

[[Eccl.9.11|11]] I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race \[is\] not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.

11: 

[[Eccl.9.12|12]] For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so \[are\] the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.

12:
