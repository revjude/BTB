[[Eccl.5|Ecclesiastes 5:1 - Ecclesiastes 5:7]]
*Approaching God with Awe*

[[Eccl.5.1|1]] Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.

1: 

[[Eccl.5.2|2]] Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter \[any\] thing before God: for God \[is\] in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.

2: 

[[Eccl.5.3|3]] For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool’s voice \[is known\] by multitude of words.

3: 

[[Eccl.5.4|4]] When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for \[he hath\] no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.

4: 

[[Eccl.5.5|5]] Better \[is it\] that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.

5: 

[[Eccl.5.6|6]] Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it \[was\] an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?

6: 

[[Eccl.5.7|7]] For in the multitude of dreams and many words \[there are\] also \[divers\] vanities: but fear thou God.

7:
