[[Eccl.1|Ecclesiastes 1:1 - Ecclesiastes 1:11]]
*Everything Is Futile*

[[Eccl.1.1|1]] The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.

1: 

[[Eccl.1.2|2]] Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all \[is\] vanity.

2: 

[[Eccl.1.3|3]] What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?

3: 

[[Eccl.1.4|4]] \[One\] generation passeth away, and \[another\] generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.

4: 

[[Eccl.1.5|5]] The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.

5: 

[[Eccl.1.6|6]] The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.

6: 

[[Eccl.1.7|7]] All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea \[is\] not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.

7: 

[[Eccl.1.8|8]] All things \[are\] full of labour; man cannot utter \[it\]: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.

8: 

[[Eccl.1.9|9]] The thing that hath been, it \[is that\] which shall be; and that which is done \[is\] that which shall be done: and \[there is\] no new \[thing\] under the sun.

9: 

[[Eccl.1.10|10]] Is there \[any\] thing whereof it may be said, See, this \[is\] new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.

10: 

[[Eccl.1.11|11]] \[There is\] no remembrance of former \[things\]; neither shall there be \[any\] remembrance of \[things\] that are to come with \[those\] that shall come after.

11:
