[[Eccl.4|Ecclesiastes 4:1 - Ecclesiastes 4:12]]
*The Evil of Oppression*

[[Eccl.4.1|1]] So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of \[such as were\] oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors \[there was\] power; but they had no comforter.

1: 

[[Eccl.4.2|2]] Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.

2: 

[[Eccl.4.3|3]] Yea, better \[is he\] than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.

3: 

[[Eccl.4.4|4]] Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This \[is\] also vanity and vexation of spirit.

4: 

[[Eccl.4.5|5]] The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.

5: 

[[Eccl.4.6|6]] Better \[is\] an handful \[with\] quietness, than both the hands full \[with\] travail and vexation of spirit.

6: 

[[Eccl.4.7|7]] Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.

7: 

[[Eccl.4.8|8]] There is one \[alone\], and \[there is\] not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet \[is there\] no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither \[saith he\], For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This \[is\] also vanity, yea, it \[is\] a sore travail.

8: 

[[Eccl.4.9|9]] Two \[are\] better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.

9: 

[[Eccl.4.10|10]] For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him \[that is\] alone when he falleth; for \[he hath\] not another to help him up.

10: 

[[Eccl.4.11|11]] Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm \[alone\]?

11: 

[[Eccl.4.12|12]] And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.

12:
