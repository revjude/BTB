[[Eccl.9|Ecclesiastes 9:13 - Ecclesiastes 9:18]]
*Wisdom Is Better than Strength*

[[Eccl.9.13|13]] This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it \[seemed\] great unto me:

13: 

[[Eccl.9.14|14]] \[There was\] a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:

14: 

[[Eccl.9.15|15]] Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.

15: 

[[Eccl.9.16|16]] Then said I, Wisdom \[is\] better than strength: nevertheless the poor man’s wisdom \[is\] despised, and his words are not heard.

16: 

[[Eccl.9.17|17]] The words of wise \[men are\] heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.

17: 

[[Eccl.9.18|18]] Wisdom \[is\] better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good.

18:
