[[Heb.3|Hebrews 3:12 - Hebrews 3:19]]
*The Peril of Unbelief*

[[Heb.3.12|12]] Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.

12: 

[[Heb.3.13|13]] But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.

13: 

[[Heb.3.14|14]] For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;

14: 

[[Heb.3.15|15]] While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.

15: 

[[Heb.3.16|16]] For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.

16: 

[[Heb.3.17|17]] But with whom was he grieved forty years? \[was it\] not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?

17: 

[[Heb.3.18|18]] And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?

18: 

[[Heb.3.19|19]] So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.

19:
