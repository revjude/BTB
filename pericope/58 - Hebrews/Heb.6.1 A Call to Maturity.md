[[Heb.6|Hebrews 6:1 - Hebrews 6:12]]
*A Call to Maturity*

[[Heb.6.1|1]] Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,

1: 

[[Heb.6.2|2]] Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.

2: 

[[Heb.6.3|3]] And this will we do, if God permit.

3: 

[[Heb.6.4|4]] For \[it is\] impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,

4: 

[[Heb.6.5|5]] And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,

5: 

[[Heb.6.6|6]] If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put \[him\] to an open shame.

6: 

[[Heb.6.7|7]] For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:

7: 

[[Heb.6.8|8]] But that which beareth thorns and briers \[is\] rejected, and \[is\] nigh unto cursing; whose end \[is\] to be burned.

8: 

[[Heb.6.9|9]] But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.

9: 

[[Heb.6.10|10]] For God \[is\] not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.

10: 

[[Heb.6.11|11]] And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:

11: 

[[Heb.6.12|12]] That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.

12:
