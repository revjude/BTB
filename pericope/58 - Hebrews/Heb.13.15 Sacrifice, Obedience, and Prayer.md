[[Heb.13|Hebrews 13:15 - Hebrews 13:19]]
*Sacrifice, Obedience, and Prayer*

[[Heb.13.15|15]] By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of \[our\] lips giving thanks to his name.

15: 

[[Heb.13.16|16]] But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.

16: 

[[Heb.13.17|17]] Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that \[is\] unprofitable for you.

17: 

[[Heb.13.18|18]] Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.

18: 

[[Heb.13.19|19]] But I beseech \[you\] the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.

19:
