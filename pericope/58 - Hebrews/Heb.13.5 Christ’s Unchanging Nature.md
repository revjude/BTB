[[Heb.13|Hebrews 13:5 - Hebrews 13:14]]
*Christ’s Unchanging Nature*

[[Heb.13.5|5]] \[Let your\] conversation \[be\] without covetousness; \[and be\] content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.

5: 

[[Heb.13.6|6]] So that we may boldly say, The Lord \[is\] my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

6: 

[[Heb.13.7|7]] Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of \[their\] conversation.

7: 

[[Heb.13.8|8]] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.

8: 

[[Heb.13.9|9]] Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For \[it is\] a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.

9: 

[[Heb.13.10|10]] We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.

10: 

[[Heb.13.11|11]] For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.

11: 

[[Heb.13.12|12]] Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.

12: 

[[Heb.13.13|13]] Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.

13: 

[[Heb.13.14|14]] For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.

14:
