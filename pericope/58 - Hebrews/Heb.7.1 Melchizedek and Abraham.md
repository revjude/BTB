[[Heb.7|Hebrews 7:1 - Hebrews 7:10]]
*Melchizedek and Abraham*

[[Heb.7.1|1]] For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;

1: 

[[Heb.7.2|2]] To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;

2: 

[[Heb.7.3|3]] Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.

3: 

[[Heb.7.4|4]] Now consider how great this man \[was\], unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.

4: 

[[Heb.7.5|5]] And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:

5: 

[[Heb.7.6|6]] But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.

6: 

[[Heb.7.7|7]] And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.

7: 

[[Heb.7.8|8]] And here men that die receive tithes; but there he \[receiveth them\], of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.

8: 

[[Heb.7.9|9]] And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.

9: 

[[Heb.7.10|10]] For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.

10:
