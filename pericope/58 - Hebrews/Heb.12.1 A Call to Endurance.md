[[Heb.12|Hebrews 12:1 - Hebrews 12:3]]
*A Call to Endurance*

[[Heb.12.1|1]] Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset \[us\], and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,

1: 

[[Heb.12.2|2]] Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of \[our\] faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.

2: 

[[Heb.12.3|3]] For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.

3:
