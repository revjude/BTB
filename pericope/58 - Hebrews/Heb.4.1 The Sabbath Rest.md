[[Heb.4|Hebrews 4:1 - Hebrews 4:11]]
*The Sabbath Rest*

[[Heb.4.1|1]] Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left \[us\] of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.

1: 

[[Heb.4.2|2]] For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard \[it\].

2: 

[[Heb.4.3|3]] For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.

3: 

[[Heb.4.4|4]] For he spake in a certain place of the seventh \[day\] on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.

4: 

[[Heb.4.5|5]] And in this \[place\] again, If they shall enter into my rest.

5: 

[[Heb.4.6|6]] Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:

6: 

[[Heb.4.7|7]] Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.

7: 

[[Heb.4.8|8]] For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.

8: 

[[Heb.4.9|9]] There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.

9: 

[[Heb.4.10|10]] For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God \[did\] from his.

10: 

[[Heb.4.11|11]] Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.

11:
