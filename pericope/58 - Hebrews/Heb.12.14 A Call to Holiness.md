[[Heb.12|Hebrews 12:14 - Hebrews 12:17]]
*A Call to Holiness*

[[Heb.12.14|14]] Follow peace with all \[men\], and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:

14: 

[[Heb.12.15|15]] Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble \[you\], and thereby many be defiled;

15: 

[[Heb.12.16|16]] Lest there \[be\] any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.

16: 

[[Heb.12.17|17]] For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.

17:
