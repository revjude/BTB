[[Heb.7|Hebrews 7:11 - Hebrews 7:28]]
*A Superior Priesthood*

[[Heb.7.11|11]] If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need \[was there\] that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?

11: 

[[Heb.7.12|12]] For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.

12: 

[[Heb.7.13|13]] For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.

13: 

[[Heb.7.14|14]] For \[it is\] evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.

14: 

[[Heb.7.15|15]] And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,

15: 

[[Heb.7.16|16]] Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.

16: 

[[Heb.7.17|17]] For he testifieth, Thou \[art\] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.

17: 

[[Heb.7.18|18]] For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.

18: 

[[Heb.7.19|19]] For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope \[did\]; by the which we draw nigh unto God.

19: 

[[Heb.7.20|20]] And inasmuch as not without an oath \[he was made priest\]:

20: 

[[Heb.7.21|21]] (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou \[art\] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)

21: 

[[Heb.7.22|22]] By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.

22: 

[[Heb.7.23|23]] And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:

23: 

[[Heb.7.24|24]] But this \[man\], because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.

24: 

[[Heb.7.25|25]] Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.

25: 

[[Heb.7.26|26]] For such an high priest became us, \[who is\] holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;

26: 

[[Heb.7.27|27]] Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.

27: 

[[Heb.7.28|28]] For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, \[maketh\] the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.

28:
