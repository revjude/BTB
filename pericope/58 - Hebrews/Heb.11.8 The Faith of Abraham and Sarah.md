[[Heb.11|Hebrews 11:8 - Hebrews 11:19]]
*The Faith of Abraham and Sarah*

[[Heb.11.8|8]] By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.

8: 

[[Heb.11.9|9]] By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as \[in\] a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:

9: 

[[Heb.11.10|10]] For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker \[is\] God.

10: 

[[Heb.11.11|11]] Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.

11: 

[[Heb.11.12|12]] Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, \[so many\] as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.

12: 

[[Heb.11.13|13]] These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of \[them\], and embraced \[them\], and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.

13: 

[[Heb.11.14|14]] For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.

14: 

[[Heb.11.15|15]] And truly, if they had been mindful of that \[country\] from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.

15: 

[[Heb.11.16|16]] But now they desire a better \[country\], that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.

16: 

[[Heb.11.17|17]] By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten \[son\],

17: 

[[Heb.11.18|18]] Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:

18: 

[[Heb.11.19|19]] Accounting that God \[was\] able to raise \[him\] up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.

19:
