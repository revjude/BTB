[[Heb.5|Hebrews 5:11 - Hebrews 5:14]]
*Milk and Solid Food*

[[Heb.5.11|11]] Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.

11: 

[[Heb.5.12|12]] For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which \[be\] the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.

12: 

[[Heb.5.13|13]] For every one that useth milk \[is\] unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.

13: 

[[Heb.5.14|14]] But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, \[even\] those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.

14:
