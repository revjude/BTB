[[Heb.12|Hebrews 12:4 - Hebrews 12:13]]
*God Disciplines His Sons*

[[Heb.12.4|4]] Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.

4: 

[[Heb.12.5|5]] And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:

5: 

[[Heb.12.6|6]] For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.

6: 

[[Heb.12.7|7]] If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?

7: 

[[Heb.12.8|8]] But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.

8: 

[[Heb.12.9|9]] Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected \[us\], and we gave \[them\] reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?

9: 

[[Heb.12.10|10]] For they verily for a few days chastened \[us\] after their own pleasure; but he for \[our\] profit, that \[we\] might be partakers of his holiness.

10: 

[[Heb.12.11|11]] Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.

11: 

[[Heb.12.12|12]] Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;

12: 

[[Heb.12.13|13]] And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.

13:
