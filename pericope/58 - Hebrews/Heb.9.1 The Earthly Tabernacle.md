[[Heb.9|Hebrews 9:1 - Hebrews 9:10]]
*The Earthly Tabernacle*

[[Heb.9.1|1]] Then verily the first \[covenant\] had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.

1: 

[[Heb.9.2|2]] For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein \[was\] the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.

2: 

[[Heb.9.3|3]] And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;

3: 

[[Heb.9.4|4]] Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein \[was\] the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;

4: 

[[Heb.9.5|5]] And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.

5: 

[[Heb.9.6|6]] Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service \[of God\].

6: 

[[Heb.9.7|7]] But into the second \[went\] the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and \[for\] the errors of the people:

7: 

[[Heb.9.8|8]] The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:

8: 

[[Heb.9.9|9]] Which \[was\] a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;

9: 

[[Heb.9.10|10]] \[Which stood\] only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed \[on them\] until the time of reformation.

10:
