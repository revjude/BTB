[[Heb.2|Hebrews 2:5 - Hebrews 2:18]]
*Jesus like His Brothers*

[[Heb.2.5|5]] For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.

5: 

[[Heb.2.6|6]] But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?

6: 

[[Heb.2.7|7]] Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:

7: 

[[Heb.2.8|8]] Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing \[that is\] not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.

8: 

[[Heb.2.9|9]] But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.

9: 

[[Heb.2.10|10]] For it became him, for whom \[are\] all things, and by whom \[are\] all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.

10: 

[[Heb.2.11|11]] For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified \[are\] all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,

11: 

[[Heb.2.12|12]] Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.

12: 

[[Heb.2.13|13]] And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.

13: 

[[Heb.2.14|14]] Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;

14: 

[[Heb.2.15|15]] And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.

15: 

[[Heb.2.16|16]] For verily he took not on \[him the nature of\] angels; but he took on \[him\] the seed of Abraham.

16: 

[[Heb.2.17|17]] Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto \[his\] brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things \[pertaining\] to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.

17: 

[[Heb.2.18|18]] For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.

18:
