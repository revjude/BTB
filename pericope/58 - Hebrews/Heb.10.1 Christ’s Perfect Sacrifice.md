[[Heb.10|Hebrews 10:1 - Hebrews 10:18]]
*Christ’s Perfect Sacrifice*

[[Heb.10.1|1]] For the law having a shadow of good things to come, \[and\] not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.

1: 

[[Heb.10.2|2]] For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.

2: 

[[Heb.10.3|3]] But in those \[sacrifices there is\] a remembrance again \[made\] of sins every year.

3: 

[[Heb.10.4|4]] For \[it is\] not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.

4: 

[[Heb.10.5|5]] Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:

5: 

[[Heb.10.6|6]] In burnt offerings and \[sacrifices\] for sin thou hast had no pleasure.

6: 

[[Heb.10.7|7]] Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.

7: 

[[Heb.10.8|8]] Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and \[offering\] for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure \[therein\]; which are offered by the law;

8: 

[[Heb.10.9|9]] Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.

9: 

[[Heb.10.10|10]] By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once \[for all\].

10: 

[[Heb.10.11|11]] And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:

11: 

[[Heb.10.12|12]] But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;

12: 

[[Heb.10.13|13]] From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.

13: 

[[Heb.10.14|14]] For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.

14: 

[[Heb.10.15|15]] \[Whereof\] the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,

15: 

[[Heb.10.16|16]] This \[is\] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;

16: 

[[Heb.10.17|17]] And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.

17: 

[[Heb.10.18|18]] Now where remission of these \[is, there is\] no more offering for sin.

18:
