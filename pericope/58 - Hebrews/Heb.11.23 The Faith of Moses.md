[[Heb.11|Hebrews 11:23 - Hebrews 11:29]]
*The Faith of Moses*

[[Heb.11.23|23]] By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw \[he was\] a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.

23: 

[[Heb.11.24|24]] By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;

24: 

[[Heb.11.25|25]] Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;

25: 

[[Heb.11.26|26]] Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.

26: 

[[Heb.11.27|27]] By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.

27: 

[[Heb.11.28|28]] Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.

28: 

[[Heb.11.29|29]] By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry \[land\]: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.

29:
