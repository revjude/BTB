[[Heb.11|Hebrews 11:4 - Hebrews 11:7]]
*The Faith of Abel, Enoch, Noah*

[[Heb.11.4|4]] By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.

4: 

[[Heb.11.5|5]] By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.

5: 

[[Heb.11.6|6]] But without faith \[it is\] impossible to please \[him\]: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and \[that\] he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

6: 

[[Heb.11.7|7]] By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.

7:
