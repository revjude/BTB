[[Heb.4|Hebrews 4:12 - Hebrews 4:16]]
*The Living Word*

[[Heb.4.12|12]] For the word of God \[is\] quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and \[is\] a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

12: 

[[Heb.4.13|13]] Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things \[are\] naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.

13: 

[[Heb.4.14|14]] Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast \[our\] profession.

14: 

[[Heb.4.15|15]] For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as \[we are, yet\] without sin.

15: 

[[Heb.4.16|16]] Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.

16:
