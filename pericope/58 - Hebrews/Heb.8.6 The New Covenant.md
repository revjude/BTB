[[Heb.8|Hebrews 8:6 - Hebrews 8:13]]
*The New Covenant*

[[Heb.8.6|6]] But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.

6: 

[[Heb.8.7|7]] For if that first \[covenant\] had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.

7: 

[[Heb.8.8|8]] For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:

8: 

[[Heb.8.9|9]] Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.

9: 

[[Heb.8.10|10]] For this \[is\] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:

10: 

[[Heb.8.11|11]] And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.

11: 

[[Heb.8.12|12]] For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.

12: 

[[Heb.8.13|13]] In that he saith, A new \[covenant\], he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old \[is\] ready to vanish away.

13:
