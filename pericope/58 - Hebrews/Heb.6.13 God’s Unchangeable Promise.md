[[Heb.6|Hebrews 6:13 - Hebrews 6:20]]
*God’s Unchangeable Promise*

[[Heb.6.13|13]] For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,

13: 

[[Heb.6.14|14]] Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.

14: 

[[Heb.6.15|15]] And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.

15: 

[[Heb.6.16|16]] For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation \[is\] to them an end of all strife.

16: 

[[Heb.6.17|17]] Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed \[it\] by an oath:

17: 

[[Heb.6.18|18]] That by two immutable things, in which \[it was\] impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:

18: 

[[Heb.6.19|19]] Which \[hope\] we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;

19: 

[[Heb.6.20|20]] Whither the forerunner is for us entered, \[even\] Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.

20:
