[[Heb.11|Hebrews 11:30 - Hebrews 11:40]]
*(Joshua–Malachi)*

[[Heb.11.30|30]] By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.

30: 

[[Heb.11.31|31]] By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.

31: 

[[Heb.11.32|32]] And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and \[of\] Barak, and \[of\] Samson, and \[of\] Jephthae; \[of\] David also, and Samuel, and \[of\] the prophets:

32: 

[[Heb.11.33|33]] Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,

33: 

[[Heb.11.34|34]] Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.

34: 

[[Heb.11.35|35]] Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:

35: 

[[Heb.11.36|36]] And others had trial of \[cruel\] mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:

36: 

[[Heb.11.37|37]] They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;

37: 

[[Heb.11.38|38]] (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and \[in\] mountains, and \[in\] dens and caves of the earth.

38: 

[[Heb.11.39|39]] And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:

39: 

[[Heb.11.40|40]] God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.

40:
