[[Heb.8|Hebrews 8:1 - Hebrews 8:5]]
*Christ’s Eternal Priesthood*

[[Heb.8.1|1]] Now of the things which we have spoken \[this is\] the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;

1: 

[[Heb.8.2|2]] A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.

2: 

[[Heb.8.3|3]] For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore \[it is\] of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.

3: 

[[Heb.8.4|4]] For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:

4: 

[[Heb.8.5|5]] Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, \[that\] thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.
