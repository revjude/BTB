[[Heb.12|Hebrews 12:18 - Hebrews 12:29]]
*An Unshakable Kingdom*

[[Heb.12.18|18]] For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,

18: 

[[Heb.12.19|19]] And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which \[voice\] they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:

19: 

[[Heb.12.20|20]] (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:

20: 

[[Heb.12.21|21]] And so terrible was the sight, \[that\] Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)

21: 

[[Heb.12.22|22]] But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,

22: 

[[Heb.12.23|23]] To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,

23: 

[[Heb.12.24|24]] And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than \[that of\] Abel.

24: 

[[Heb.12.25|25]] See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more \[shall not\] we \[escape\], if we turn away from him that \[speaketh\] from heaven:

25: 

[[Heb.12.26|26]] Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.

26: 

[[Heb.12.27|27]] And this \[word\], Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.

27: 

[[Heb.12.28|28]] Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:

28: 

[[Heb.12.29|29]] For our God \[is\] a consuming fire.

29:
