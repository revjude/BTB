[[Heb.3|Hebrews 3:1 - Hebrews 3:6]]
*Jesus Our Apostle and High Priest*

[[Heb.3.1|1]] Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;

1: 

[[Heb.3.2|2]] Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses \[was faithful\] in all his house.

2: 

[[Heb.3.3|3]] For this \[man\] was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.

3: 

[[Heb.3.4|4]] For every house is builded by some \[man\]; but he that built all things \[is\] God.

4: 

[[Heb.3.5|5]] And Moses verily \[was\] faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;

5: 

[[Heb.3.6|6]] But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.

6:
