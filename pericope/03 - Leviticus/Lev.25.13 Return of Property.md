[[Lev.25|Leviticus 25:13 - Leviticus 25:17]]
*Return of Property*

[[Lev.25.13|13]] In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.

13: 

[[Lev.25.14|14]] And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest \[ought\] of thy neighbour’s hand, ye shall not oppress one another:

14: 

[[Lev.25.15|15]] According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, \[and\] according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:

15: 

[[Lev.25.16|16]] According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for \[according\] to the number \[of the years\] of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.

16: 

[[Lev.25.17|17]] Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I \[am\] the LORD your God.
