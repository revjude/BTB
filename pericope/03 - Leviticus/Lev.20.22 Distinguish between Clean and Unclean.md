[[Lev.20|Leviticus 20:22 - Leviticus 20:27]]
*Distinguish between Clean and Unclean*

[[Lev.20.22|22]] Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out.

22: 

[[Lev.20.23|23]] And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.

23: 

[[Lev.20.24|24]] But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I \[am\] the LORD your God, which have separated you from \[other\] people.

24: 

[[Lev.20.25|25]] Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.

25: 

[[Lev.20.26|26]] And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD \[am\] holy, and have severed you from \[other\] people, that ye should be mine.

26: 

[[Lev.20.27|27]] A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood \[shall be\] upon them.

27:
