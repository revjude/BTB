[[Lev.25|Leviticus 25:35 - Leviticus 25:38]]
*Redemption of the Poor*

[[Lev.25.35|35]] And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: \[yea, though he be\] a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.

35: 

[[Lev.25.36|36]] Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.

36: 

[[Lev.25.37|37]] Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.

37: 

[[Lev.25.38|38]] I \[am\] the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, \[and\] to be your God.

38:
