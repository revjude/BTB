[[Lev.7|Leviticus 7:11 - Leviticus 7:21]]
*The Peace Offering*

[[Lev.7.11|11]] And this \[is\] the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer unto the LORD.

11: 

[[Lev.7.12|12]] If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.

12: 

[[Lev.7.13|13]] Besides the cakes, he shall offer \[for\] his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.

13: 

[[Lev.7.14|14]] And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation \[for\] an heave offering unto the LORD, \[and\] it shall be the priest’s that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.

14: 

[[Lev.7.15|15]] And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.

15: 

[[Lev.7.16|16]] But if the sacrifice of his offering \[be\] a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:

16: 

[[Lev.7.17|17]] But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.

17: 

[[Lev.7.18|18]] And if \[any\] of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.

18: 

[[Lev.7.19|19]] And the flesh that toucheth any unclean \[thing\] shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof.

19: 

[[Lev.7.20|20]] But the soul that eateth \[of\] the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that \[pertain\] unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.

20: 

[[Lev.7.21|21]] Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean \[thing, as\] the uncleanness of man, or \[any\] unclean beast, or any abominable unclean \[thing\], and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which \[pertain\] unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.

21:
