[[Lev.6|Leviticus 6:14 - Leviticus 6:23]]
*The Grain Offering*

[[Lev.6.14|14]] And this \[is\] the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar.

14: 

[[Lev.6.15|15]] And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which \[is\] upon the meat offering, and shall burn \[it\] upon the altar \[for\] a sweet savour, \[even\] the memorial of it, unto the LORD.

15: 

[[Lev.6.16|16]] And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.

16: 

[[Lev.6.17|17]] It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it \[unto them for\] their portion of my offerings made by fire; it \[is\] most holy, as \[is\] the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.

17: 

[[Lev.6.18|18]] All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. \[It shall be\] a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall be holy.

18: 

[[Lev.6.19|19]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

19: 

[[Lev.6.20|20]] This \[is\] the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night.

20: 

[[Lev.6.21|21]] In a pan it shall be made with oil; \[and when it is\] baken, thou shalt bring it in: \[and\] the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer \[for\] a sweet savour unto the LORD.

21: 

[[Lev.6.22|22]] And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it: \[it is\] a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly burnt.

22: 

[[Lev.6.23|23]] For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten.

23:
