[[Lev.26|Leviticus 26:1 - Leviticus 26:13]]
*Additional Blessings of Obedience*

[[Lev.26.1|1]] Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up \[any\] image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I \[am\] the LORD your God.

1: 

[[Lev.26.2|2]] Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I \[am\] the LORD.

2: 

[[Lev.26.3|3]] If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;

3: 

[[Lev.26.4|4]] Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.

4: 

[[Lev.26.5|5]] And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.

5: 

[[Lev.26.6|6]] And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make \[you\] afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.

6: 

[[Lev.26.7|7]] And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.

7: 

[[Lev.26.8|8]] And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.

8: 

[[Lev.26.9|9]] For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.

9: 

[[Lev.26.10|10]] And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.

10: 

[[Lev.26.11|11]] And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.

11: 

[[Lev.26.12|12]] And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.

12: 

[[Lev.26.13|13]] I \[am\] the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.

13:
