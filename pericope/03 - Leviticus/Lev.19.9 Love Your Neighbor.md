[[Lev.19|Leviticus 19:9 - Leviticus 19:18]]
*Love Your Neighbor*

[[Lev.19.9|9]] And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.

9: 

[[Lev.19.10|10]] And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather \[every\] grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I \[am\] the LORD your God.

10: 

[[Lev.19.11|11]] Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.

11: 

[[Lev.19.12|12]] And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I \[am\] the LORD.

12: 

[[Lev.19.13|13]] Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob \[him\]: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.

13: 

[[Lev.19.14|14]] Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I \[am\] the LORD.

14: 

[[Lev.19.15|15]] Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: \[but\] in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.

15: 

[[Lev.19.16|16]] Thou shalt not go up and down \[as\] a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I \[am\] the LORD.

16: 

[[Lev.19.17|17]] Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.

17: 

[[Lev.19.18|18]] Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I \[am\] the LORD.

18:
