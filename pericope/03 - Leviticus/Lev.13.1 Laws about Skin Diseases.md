[[Lev.13|Leviticus 13:1 - Leviticus 13:46]]
*Laws about Skin Diseases*

[[Lev.13.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,

1: 

[[Lev.13.2|2]] When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh \[like\] the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:

2: 

[[Lev.13.3|3]] And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and \[when\] the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight \[be\] deeper than the skin of his flesh, it \[is\] a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.

3: 

[[Lev.13.4|4]] If the bright spot \[be\] white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight \[be\] not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up \[him that hath\] the plague seven days:

4: 

[[Lev.13.5|5]] And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, \[if\] the plague in his sight be at a stay, \[and\] the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:

5: 

[[Lev.13.6|6]] And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, \[if\] the plague \[be\] somewhat dark, \[and\] the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it \[is but\] a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

6: 

[[Lev.13.7|7]] But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again:

7: 

[[Lev.13.8|8]] And \[if\] the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it \[is\] a leprosy.

8: 

[[Lev.13.9|9]] When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;

9: 

[[Lev.13.10|10]] And the priest shall see \[him\]: and, behold, \[if\] the rising \[be\] white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and \[there be\] quick raw flesh in the rising;

10: 

[[Lev.13.11|11]] It \[is\] an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he \[is\] unclean.

11: 

[[Lev.13.12|12]] And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of \[him that hath\] the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;

12: 

[[Lev.13.13|13]] Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, \[if\] the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce \[him\] clean \[that hath\] the plague: it is all turned white: he \[is\] clean.

13: 

[[Lev.13.14|14]] But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.

14: 

[[Lev.13.15|15]] And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: \[for\] the raw flesh \[is\] unclean: it \[is\] a leprosy.

15: 

[[Lev.13.16|16]] Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;

16: 

[[Lev.13.17|17]] And the priest shall see him: and, behold, \[if\] the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce \[him\] clean \[that hath\] the plague: he \[is\] clean.

17: 

[[Lev.13.18|18]] The flesh also, in which, \[even\] in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,

18: 

[[Lev.13.19|19]] And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest;

19: 

[[Lev.13.20|20]] And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it \[be\] in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it \[is\] a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.

20: 

[[Lev.13.21|21]] But if the priest look on it, and, behold, \[there be\] no white hairs therein, and \[if\] it \[be\] not lower than the skin, but \[be\] somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:

21: 

[[Lev.13.22|22]] And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it \[is\] a plague.

22: 

[[Lev.13.23|23]] But if the bright spot stay in his place, \[and\] spread not, it \[is\] a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

23: 

[[Lev.13.24|24]] Or if there be \[any\] flesh, in the skin whereof \[there is\] a hot burning, and the quick \[flesh\] that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white;

24: 

[[Lev.13.25|25]] Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, \[if\] the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it \[be in\] sight deeper than the skin; it \[is\] a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it \[is\] the plague of leprosy.

25: 

[[Lev.13.26|26]] But if the priest look on it, and, behold, \[there be\] no white hair in the bright spot, and it \[be\] no lower than the \[other\] skin, but \[be\] somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:

26: 

[[Lev.13.27|27]] And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: \[and\] if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it \[is\] the plague of leprosy.

27: 

[[Lev.13.28|28]] And if the bright spot stay in his place, \[and\] spread not in the skin, but it \[be\] somewhat dark; it \[is\] a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it \[is\] an inflammation of the burning.

28: 

[[Lev.13.29|29]] If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;

29: 

[[Lev.13.30|30]] Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it \[be\] in sight deeper than the skin; \[and there be\] in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it \[is\] a dry scall, \[even\] a leprosy upon the head or beard.

30: 

[[Lev.13.31|31]] And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it \[be\] not in sight deeper than the skin, and \[that there is\] no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up \[him that hath\] the plague of the scall seven days:

31: 

[[Lev.13.32|32]] And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, \[if\] the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall \[be\] not in sight deeper than the skin;

32: 

[[Lev.13.33|33]] He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up \[him that hath\] the scall seven days more:

33: 

[[Lev.13.34|34]] And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, \[if\] the scall be not spread in the skin, nor \[be\] in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

34: 

[[Lev.13.35|35]] But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;

35: 

[[Lev.13.36|36]] Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he \[is\] unclean.

36: 

[[Lev.13.37|37]] But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and \[that\] there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he \[is\] clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

37: 

[[Lev.13.38|38]] If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, \[even\] white bright spots;

38: 

[[Lev.13.39|39]] Then the priest shall look: and, behold, \[if\] the bright spots in the skin of their flesh \[be\] darkish white; it \[is\] a freckled spot \[that\] groweth in the skin; he \[is\] clean.

39: 

[[Lev.13.40|40]] And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he \[is\] bald; \[yet is\] he clean.

40: 

[[Lev.13.41|41]] And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he \[is\] forehead bald: \[yet is\] he clean.

41: 

[[Lev.13.42|42]] And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it \[is\] a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.

42: 

[[Lev.13.43|43]] Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, \[if\] the rising of the sore \[be\] white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;

43: 

[[Lev.13.44|44]] He is a leprous man, he \[is\] unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague \[is\] in his head.

44: 

[[Lev.13.45|45]] And the leper in whom the plague \[is\], his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.

45: 

[[Lev.13.46|46]] All the days wherein the plague \[shall be\] in him he shall be defiled; he \[is\] unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp \[shall\] his habitation \[be\].
