[[Lev.18|Leviticus 18:1 - Leviticus 18:30]]
*Unlawful Sexual Relations*

[[Lev.18.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

1: 

[[Lev.18.2|2]] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God.

2: 

[[Lev.18.3|3]] After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.

3: 

[[Lev.18.4|4]] Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I \[am\] the LORD your God.

4: 

[[Lev.18.5|5]] Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I \[am\] the LORD.

5: 

[[Lev.18.6|6]] None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover \[their\] nakedness: I \[am\] the LORD.

6: 

[[Lev.18.7|7]] The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she \[is\] thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

7: 

[[Lev.18.8|8]] The nakedness of thy father’s wife shalt thou not uncover: it \[is\] thy father’s nakedness.

8: 

[[Lev.18.9|9]] The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, \[whether she be\] born at home, or born abroad, \[even\] their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.

9: 

[[Lev.18.10|10]] The nakedness of thy son’s daughter, or of thy daughter’s daughter, \[even\] their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs \[is\] thine own nakedness.

10: 

[[Lev.18.11|11]] The nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter, begotten of thy father, she \[is\] thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

11: 

[[Lev.18.12|12]] Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s sister: she \[is\] thy father’s near kinswoman.

12: 

[[Lev.18.13|13]] Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister: for she \[is\] thy mother’s near kinswoman.

13: 

[[Lev.18.14|14]] Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she \[is\] thine aunt.

14: 

[[Lev.18.15|15]] Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she \[is\] thy son’s wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

15: 

[[Lev.18.16|16]] Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother’s wife: it \[is\] thy brother’s nakedness.

16: 

[[Lev.18.17|17]] Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness; \[for\] they \[are\] her near kinswomen: it \[is\] wickedness.

17: 

[[Lev.18.18|18]] Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex \[her\], to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life \[time\].

18: 

[[Lev.18.19|19]] Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.

19: 

[[Lev.18.20|20]] Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour’s wife, to defile thyself with her.

20: 

[[Lev.18.21|21]] And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through \[the fire\] to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I \[am\] the LORD.

21: 

[[Lev.18.22|22]] Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it \[is\] abomination.

22: 

[[Lev.18.23|23]] Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it \[is\] confusion.

23: 

[[Lev.18.24|24]] Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:

24: 

[[Lev.18.25|25]] And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.

25: 

[[Lev.18.26|26]] Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit \[any\] of these abominations; \[neither\] any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:

26: 

[[Lev.18.27|27]] (For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which \[were\] before you, and the land is defiled;)

27: 

[[Lev.18.28|28]] That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that \[were\] before you.

28: 

[[Lev.18.29|29]] For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit \[them\] shall be cut off from among their people.

29: 

[[Lev.18.30|30]] Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that \[ye\] commit not \[any one\] of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I \[am\] the LORD your God.

30:
