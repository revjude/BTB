[[Lev.12|Leviticus 12:1 - Leviticus 12:8]]
*Purification after Childbirth*

[[Lev.12.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

1: 

[[Lev.12.2|2]] Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.

2: 

[[Lev.12.3|3]] And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.

3: 

[[Lev.12.4|4]] And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.

4: 

[[Lev.12.5|5]] But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days.

5: 

[[Lev.12.6|6]] And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:

6: 

[[Lev.12.7|7]] Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This \[is\] the law for her that hath born a male or a female.

7: 

[[Lev.12.8|8]] And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.

8:
