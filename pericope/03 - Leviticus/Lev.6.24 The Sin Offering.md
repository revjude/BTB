[[Lev.6|Leviticus 6:24 - Leviticus 6:30]]
*The Sin Offering*

[[Lev.6.24|24]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

24: 

[[Lev.6.25|25]] Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This \[is\] the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it \[is\] most holy.

25: 

[[Lev.6.26|26]] The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.

26: 

[[Lev.6.27|27]] Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.

27: 

[[Lev.6.28|28]] But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in water.

28: 

[[Lev.6.29|29]] All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it \[is\] most holy.

29: 

[[Lev.6.30|30]] And no sin offering, whereof \[any\] of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile \[withal\] in the holy \[place\], shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.

30:
