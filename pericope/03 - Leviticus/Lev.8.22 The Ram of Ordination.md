[[Lev.8|Leviticus 8:22 - Leviticus 8:36]]
*The Ram of Ordination*

[[Lev.8.22|22]] And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

22: 

[[Lev.8.23|23]] And he slew \[it\]; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put \[it\] upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.

23: 

[[Lev.8.24|24]] And he brought Aaron’s sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.

24: 

[[Lev.8.25|25]] And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that \[was\] upon the inwards, and the caul \[above\] the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:

25: 

[[Lev.8.26|26]] And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that \[was\] before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put \[them\] on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:

26: 

[[Lev.8.27|27]] And he put all upon Aaron’s hands, and upon his sons’ hands, and waved them \[for\] a wave offering before the LORD.

27: 

[[Lev.8.28|28]] And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt \[them\] on the altar upon the burnt offering: they \[were\] consecrations for a sweet savour: it \[is\] an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

28: 

[[Lev.8.29|29]] And Moses took the breast, and waved it \[for\] a wave offering before the LORD: \[for\] of the ram of consecration it was Moses’ part; as the LORD commanded Moses.

29: 

[[Lev.8.30|30]] And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which \[was\] upon the altar, and sprinkled \[it\] upon Aaron, \[and\] upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons’ garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, \[and\] his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him.

30: 

[[Lev.8.31|31]] And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh \[at\] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that \[is\] in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.

31: 

[[Lev.8.32|32]] And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.

32: 

[[Lev.8.33|33]] And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation \[in\] seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.

33: 

[[Lev.8.34|34]] As he hath done this day, \[so\] the LORD hath commanded to do, to make an atonement for you.

34: 

[[Lev.8.35|35]] Therefore shall ye abide \[at\] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.

35: 

[[Lev.8.36|36]] So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.

36:
