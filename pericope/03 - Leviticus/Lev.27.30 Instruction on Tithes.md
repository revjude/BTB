[[Lev.27|Leviticus 27:30 - Leviticus 27:34]]
*Instruction on Tithes*

[[Lev.27.30|30]] And all the tithe of the land, \[whether\] of the seed of the land, \[or\] of the fruit of the tree, \[is\] the LORD’S: \[it is\] holy unto the LORD.

30: 

[[Lev.27.31|31]] And if a man will at all redeem \[ought\] of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth \[part\] thereof.

31: 

[[Lev.27.32|32]] And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, \[even\] of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.

32: 

[[Lev.27.33|33]] He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.

33: 

[[Lev.27.34|34]] These \[are\] the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.

34:
