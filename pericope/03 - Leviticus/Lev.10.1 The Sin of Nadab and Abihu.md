[[Lev.10|Leviticus 10:1 - Leviticus 10:7]]
*The Sin of Nadab and Abihu*

[[Lev.10.1|1]] And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.

1: 

[[Lev.10.2|2]] And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.

2: 

[[Lev.10.3|3]] Then Moses said unto Aaron, This \[is it\] that the LORD spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.

3: 

[[Lev.10.4|4]] And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.

4: 

[[Lev.10.5|5]] So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.

5: 

[[Lev.10.6|6]] And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.

6: 

[[Lev.10.7|7]] And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD \[is\] upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.

7:
