[[Lev.23|Leviticus 23:33 - Leviticus 23:44]]
*The Feast of Tabernacles*

[[Lev.23.33|33]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

33: 

[[Lev.23.34|34]] Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month \[shall be\] the feast of tabernacles \[for\] seven days unto the LORD.

34: 

[[Lev.23.35|35]] On the first day \[shall be\] an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work \[therein\].

35: 

[[Lev.23.36|36]] Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it \[is\] a solemn assembly; \[and\] ye shall do no servile work \[therein\].

36: 

[[Lev.23.37|37]] These \[are\] the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim \[to be\] holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day:

37: 

[[Lev.23.38|38]] Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.

38: 

[[Lev.23.39|39]] Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days: on the first day \[shall be\] a sabbath, and on the eighth day \[shall be\] a sabbath.

39: 

[[Lev.23.40|40]] And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.

40: 

[[Lev.23.41|41]] And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year. \[It shall be\] a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month.

41: 

[[Lev.23.42|42]] Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths:

42: 

[[Lev.23.43|43]] That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I \[am\] the LORD your God.

43: 

[[Lev.23.44|44]] And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.
