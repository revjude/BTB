[[Lev.21|Leviticus 21:1 - Leviticus 21:15]]
*Holiness Required of Priests*

[[Lev.21.1|1]] And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people:

1: 

[[Lev.21.2|2]] But for his kin, that is near unto him, \[that is\], for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother,

2: 

[[Lev.21.3|3]] And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled.

3: 

[[Lev.21.4|4]] \[But\] he shall not defile himself, \[being\] a chief man among his people, to profane himself.

4: 

[[Lev.21.5|5]] They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.

5: 

[[Lev.21.6|6]] They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, \[and\] the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.

6: 

[[Lev.21.7|7]] They shall not take a wife \[that is\] a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he \[is\] holy unto his God.

7: 

[[Lev.21.8|8]] Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, \[am\] holy.

8: 

[[Lev.21.9|9]] And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.

9: 

[[Lev.21.10|10]] And \[he that is\] the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;

10: 

[[Lev.21.11|11]] Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;

11: 

[[Lev.21.12|12]] Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God \[is\] upon him: I \[am\] the LORD.

12: 

[[Lev.21.13|13]] And he shall take a wife in her virginity.

13: 

[[Lev.21.14|14]] A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, \[or\] an harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife.

14: 

[[Lev.21.15|15]] Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the LORD do sanctify him.

15:
