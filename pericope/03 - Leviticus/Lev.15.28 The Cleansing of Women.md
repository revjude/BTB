[[Lev.15|Leviticus 15:28 - Leviticus 15:33]]
*The Cleansing of Women*

[[Lev.15.28|28]] But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.

28: 

[[Lev.15.29|29]] And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

29: 

[[Lev.15.30|30]] And the priest shall offer the one \[for\] a sin offering, and the other \[for\] a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness.

30: 

[[Lev.15.31|31]] Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that \[is\] among them.

31: 

[[Lev.15.32|32]] This \[is\] the law of him that hath an issue, and \[of him\] whose seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;

32: 

[[Lev.15.33|33]] And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.

33:
