[[Lev.24|Leviticus 24:10 - Leviticus 24:16]]
*Punishment for Blasphemy*

[[Lev.24.10|10]] And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father \[was\] an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish \[woman\] and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;

10: 

[[Lev.24.11|11]] And the Israelitish woman’s son blasphemed the name \[of the LORD\], and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother’s name \[was\] Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)

11: 

[[Lev.24.12|12]] And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them.

12: 

[[Lev.24.13|13]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

13: 

[[Lev.24.14|14]] Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard \[him\] lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.

14: 

[[Lev.24.15|15]] And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.

15: 

[[Lev.24.16|16]] And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, \[and\] all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name \[of the LORD\], shall be put to death.

16:
