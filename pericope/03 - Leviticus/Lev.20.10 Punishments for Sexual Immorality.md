*Punishments for Sexual Immorality*

[[Lev.20.10|10]] And the man that committeth adultery with \[another\] man’s wife, \[even he\] that committeth adultery with his neighbour’s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.

10: 

[[Lev.20.11|11]] And the man that lieth with his father’s wife hath uncovered his father’s nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood \[shall be\] upon them.

11: 

[[Lev.20.12|12]] And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood \[shall be\] upon them.

12: 

[[Lev.20.13|13]] If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood \[shall be\] upon them.

13: 

[[Lev.20.14|14]] And if a man take a wife and her mother, it \[is\] wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.

14: 

[[Lev.20.15|15]] And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.

15: 

[[Lev.20.16|16]] And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood \[shall be\] upon them.

16: 

[[Lev.20.17|17]] And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter, or his mother’s daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it \[is\] a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.

17: 

[[Lev.20.18|18]] And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.

18: 

[[Lev.20.19|19]] And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister, nor of thy father’s sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.

19: 

[[Lev.20.20|20]] And if a man shall lie with his uncle’s wife, he hath uncovered his uncle’s nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.

20: 

[[Lev.20.21|21]] And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it \[is\] an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.
