[[Lev.8|Leviticus 8:14 - Leviticus 8:17]]
*The Priests’ Sin Offering*

[[Lev.8.14|14]] And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.

14: 

[[Lev.8.15|15]] And he slew \[it\]; and Moses took the blood, and put \[it\] upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.

15: 

[[Lev.8.16|16]] And he took all the fat that \[was\] upon the inwards, and the caul \[above\] the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned \[it\] upon the altar.

16: 

[[Lev.8.17|17]] But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.

17:
