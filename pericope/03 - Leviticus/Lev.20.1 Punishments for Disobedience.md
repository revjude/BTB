[[Lev.20|Leviticus 20:1 - Leviticus 20:9]]
*Punishments for Disobedience*

[[Lev.20.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

1: 

[[Lev.20.2|2]] Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever \[he be\] of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth \[any\] of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.

2: 

[[Lev.20.3|3]] And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.

3: 

[[Lev.20.4|4]] And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:

4: 

[[Lev.20.5|5]] Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.

5: 

[[Lev.20.6|6]] And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.

6: 

[[Lev.20.7|7]] Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I \[am\] the LORD your God.

7: 

[[Lev.20.8|8]] And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I \[am\] the LORD which sanctify you.

8: 

[[Lev.20.9|9]] For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood \[shall be\] upon him.

9:
