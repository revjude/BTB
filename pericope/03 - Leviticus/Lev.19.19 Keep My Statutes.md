[[Lev.19|Leviticus 19:19 - Leviticus 19:37]]
*Keep My Statutes*

[[Lev.19.19|19]] Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.

19: 

[[Lev.19.20|20]] And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that \[is\] a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.

20: 

[[Lev.19.21|21]] And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, \[even\] a ram for a trespass offering.

21: 

[[Lev.19.22|22]] And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.

22: 

[[Lev.19.23|23]] And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.

23: 

[[Lev.19.24|24]] But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD \[withal\].

24: 

[[Lev.19.25|25]] And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I \[am\] the LORD your God.

25: 

[[Lev.19.26|26]] Ye shall not eat \[any thing\] with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.

26: 

[[Lev.19.27|27]] Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.

27: 

[[Lev.19.28|28]] Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I \[am\] the LORD.

28: 

[[Lev.19.29|29]] Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.

29: 

[[Lev.19.30|30]] Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I \[am\] the LORD.

30: 

[[Lev.19.31|31]] Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I \[am\] the LORD your God.

31: 

[[Lev.19.32|32]] Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I \[am\] the LORD.

32: 

[[Lev.19.33|33]] And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.

33: 

[[Lev.19.34|34]] \[But\] the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I \[am\] the LORD your God.

34: 

[[Lev.19.35|35]] Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.

35: 

[[Lev.19.36|36]] Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I \[am\] the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.

36: 

[[Lev.19.37|37]] Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I \[am\] the LORD.

37:
