[[Lev.26|Leviticus 26:40 - Leviticus 26:46]]
*God Remembers Those Who Repent*

[[Lev.26.40|40]] If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;

40: 

[[Lev.26.41|41]] And \[that\] I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:

41: 

[[Lev.26.42|42]] Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.

42: 

[[Lev.26.43|43]] The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.

43: 

[[Lev.26.44|44]] And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I \[am\] the LORD their God.

44: 

[[Lev.26.45|45]] But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I \[am\] the LORD.

45: 

[[Lev.26.46|46]] These \[are\] the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.

46:
