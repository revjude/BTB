[[Lev.17|Leviticus 17:1 - Leviticus 17:9]]
*The Place of Sacrifice*

[[Lev.17.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

1: 

[[Lev.17.2|2]] Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them; This \[is\] the thing which the LORD hath commanded, saying,

2: 

[[Lev.17.3|3]] What man soever \[there be\] of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth \[it\] out of the camp,

3: 

[[Lev.17.4|4]] And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:

4: 

[[Lev.17.5|5]] To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them \[for\] peace offerings unto the LORD.

5: 

[[Lev.17.6|6]] And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD \[at\] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

6: 

[[Lev.17.7|7]] And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations.

7: 

[[Lev.17.8|8]] And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man \[there be\] of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,

8: 

[[Lev.17.9|9]] And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.

9:
