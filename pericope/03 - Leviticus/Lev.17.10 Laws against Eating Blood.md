[[Lev.17|Leviticus 17:10 - Leviticus 17:16]]
*Laws against Eating Blood*

[[Lev.17.10|10]] And whatsoever man \[there be\] of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.

10: 

[[Lev.17.11|11]] For the life of the flesh \[is\] in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it \[is\] the blood \[that\] maketh an atonement for the soul.

11: 

[[Lev.17.12|12]] Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.

12: 

[[Lev.17.13|13]] And whatsoever man \[there be\] of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.

13: 

[[Lev.17.14|14]] For \[it is\] the life of all flesh; the blood of it \[is\] for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh \[is\] the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.

14: 

[[Lev.17.15|15]] And every soul that eateth that which died \[of itself\], or that which was torn \[with beasts, whether it be\] one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe \[himself\] in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.

15: 

[[Lev.17.16|16]] But if he wash \[them\] not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity.

16:
