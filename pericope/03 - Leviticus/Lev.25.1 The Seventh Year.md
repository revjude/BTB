[[Lev.25|Leviticus 25:1 - Leviticus 25:7]]
*The Seventh Year*

[[Lev.25.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,

1: 

[[Lev.25.2|2]] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.

2: 

[[Lev.25.3|3]] Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;

3: 

[[Lev.25.4|4]] But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.

4: 

[[Lev.25.5|5]] That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: \[for\] it is a year of rest unto the land.

5: 

[[Lev.25.6|6]] And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,

6: 

[[Lev.25.7|7]] And for thy cattle, and for the beast that \[are\] in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.

7:
