[[Lev.11|Leviticus 11:1 - Leviticus 11:47]]
*Clean and Unclean Animals*

[[Lev.11.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,

1: 

[[Lev.11.2|2]] Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These \[are\] the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that \[are\] on the earth.

2: 

[[Lev.11.3|3]] Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, \[and\] cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.

3: 

[[Lev.11.4|4]] Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: \[as\] the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he \[is\] unclean unto you.

4: 

[[Lev.11.5|5]] And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he \[is\] unclean unto you.

5: 

[[Lev.11.6|6]] And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he \[is\] unclean unto you.

6: 

[[Lev.11.7|7]] And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he \[is\] unclean to you.

7: 

[[Lev.11.8|8]] Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they \[are\] unclean to you.

8: 

[[Lev.11.9|9]] These shall ye eat of all that \[are\] in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.

9: 

[[Lev.11.10|10]] And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which \[is\] in the waters, they \[shall be\] an abomination unto you:

10: 

[[Lev.11.11|11]] They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.

11: 

[[Lev.11.12|12]] Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that \[shall be\] an abomination unto you.

12: 

[[Lev.11.13|13]] And these \[are they which\] ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they \[are\] an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,

13: 

[[Lev.11.14|14]] And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;

14: 

[[Lev.11.15|15]] Every raven after his kind;

15: 

[[Lev.11.16|16]] And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,

16: 

[[Lev.11.17|17]] And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,

17: 

[[Lev.11.18|18]] And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,

18: 

[[Lev.11.19|19]] And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.

19: 

[[Lev.11.20|20]] All fowls that creep, going upon \[all\] four, \[shall be\] an abomination unto you.

20: 

[[Lev.11.21|21]] Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon \[all\] four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;

21: 

[[Lev.11.22|22]] \[Even\] these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.

22: 

[[Lev.11.23|23]] But all \[other\] flying creeping things, which have four feet, \[shall be\] an abomination unto you.

23: 

[[Lev.11.24|24]] And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.

24: 

[[Lev.11.25|25]] And whosoever beareth \[ought\] of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.

25: 

[[Lev.11.26|26]] \[The carcases\] of every beast which divideth the hoof, and \[is\] not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, \[are\] unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.

26: 

[[Lev.11.27|27]] And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on \[all\] four, those \[are\] unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.

27: 

[[Lev.11.28|28]] And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they \[are\] unclean unto you.

28: 

[[Lev.11.29|29]] These also \[shall be\] unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,

29: 

[[Lev.11.30|30]] And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.

30: 

[[Lev.11.31|31]] These \[are\] unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.

31: 

[[Lev.11.32|32]] And upon whatsoever \[any\] of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether \[it be\] any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel \[it be\], wherein \[any\] work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.

32: 

[[Lev.11.33|33]] And every earthen vessel, whereinto \[any\] of them falleth, whatsoever \[is\] in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.

33: 

[[Lev.11.34|34]] Of all meat which may be eaten, \[that\] on which \[such\] water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every \[such\] vessel shall be unclean.

34: 

[[Lev.11.35|35]] And every \[thing\] whereupon \[any part\] of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; \[whether it be\] oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: \[for\] they \[are\] unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.

35: 

[[Lev.11.36|36]] Nevertheless a fountain or pit, \[wherein there is\] plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean.

36: 

[[Lev.11.37|37]] And if \[any part\] of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it \[shall be\] clean.

37: 

[[Lev.11.38|38]] But if \[any\] water be put upon the seed, and \[any part\] of their carcase fall thereon, it \[shall be\] unclean unto you.

38: 

[[Lev.11.39|39]] And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.

39: 

[[Lev.11.40|40]] And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.

40: 

[[Lev.11.41|41]] And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth \[shall be\] an abomination; it shall not be eaten.

41: 

[[Lev.11.42|42]] Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon \[all\] four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they \[are\] an abomination.

42: 

[[Lev.11.43|43]] Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.

43: 

[[Lev.11.44|44]] For I \[am\] the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I \[am\] holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

44: 

[[Lev.11.45|45]] For I \[am\] the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I \[am\] holy.

45: 

[[Lev.11.46|46]] This \[is\] the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:

46: 

[[Lev.11.47|47]] To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.
