[[Lev.7|Leviticus 7:22 - Leviticus 7:27]]
*Fat and Blood Forbidden*

[[Lev.7.22|22]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

22: 

[[Lev.7.23|23]] Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.

23: 

[[Lev.7.24|24]] And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it.

24: 

[[Lev.7.25|25]] For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth \[it\] shall be cut off from his people.

25: 

[[Lev.7.26|26]] Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, \[whether it be\] of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.

26: 

[[Lev.7.27|27]] Whatsoever soul \[it be\] that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.

27:
