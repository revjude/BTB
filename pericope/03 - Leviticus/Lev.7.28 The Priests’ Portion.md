[[Lev.7|Leviticus 7:28 - Leviticus 7:38]]
*The Priests’ Portion*

[[Lev.7.28|28]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

28: 

[[Lev.7.29|29]] Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.

29: 

[[Lev.7.30|30]] His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved \[for\] a wave offering before the LORD.

30: 

[[Lev.7.31|31]] And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron’s and his sons’.

31: 

[[Lev.7.32|32]] And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest \[for\] an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.

32: 

[[Lev.7.33|33]] He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for \[his\] part.

33: 

[[Lev.7.34|34]] For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel.

34: 

[[Lev.7.35|35]] This \[is the portion\] of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day \[when\] he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest’s office;

35: 

[[Lev.7.36|36]] Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, \[by\] a statute for ever throughout their generations.

36: 

[[Lev.7.37|37]] This \[is\] the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;

37: 

[[Lev.7.38|38]] Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.

38:
