[[Lev.13|Leviticus 13:47 - Leviticus 13:59]]
*Laws about Mildew*

[[Lev.13.47|47]] The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, \[whether it be\] a woollen garment, or a linen garment;

47: 

[[Lev.13.48|48]] Whether \[it be\] in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;

48: 

[[Lev.13.49|49]] And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it \[is\] a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest:

49: 

[[Lev.13.50|50]] And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up \[it that hath\] the plague seven days:

50: 

[[Lev.13.51|51]] And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, \[or\] in any work that is made of skin; the plague \[is\] a fretting leprosy; it \[is\] unclean.

51: 

[[Lev.13.52|52]] He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it \[is\] a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.

52: 

[[Lev.13.53|53]] And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;

53: 

[[Lev.13.54|54]] Then the priest shall command that they wash \[the thing\] wherein the plague \[is\], and he shall shut it up seven days more:

54: 

[[Lev.13.55|55]] And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, \[if\] the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it \[is\] unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it \[is\] fret inward, \[whether\] it \[be\] bare within or without.

55: 

[[Lev.13.56|56]] And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague \[be\] somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:

56: 

[[Lev.13.57|57]] And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it \[is\] a spreading \[plague\]: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague \[is\] with fire.

57: 

[[Lev.13.58|58]] And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin \[it be\], which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.

58: 

[[Lev.13.59|59]] This \[is\] the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.
