[[Lev.5|Leviticus 5:14 - Leviticus 5:19]]
*Laws for Guilt Offerings*

[[Lev.5.14|14]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

14: 

[[Lev.5.15|15]] If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering:

15: 

[[Lev.5.16|16]] And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.

16: 

[[Lev.5.17|17]] And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist \[it\] not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.

17: 

[[Lev.5.18|18]] And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist \[it\] not, and it shall be forgiven him.

18: 

[[Lev.5.19|19]] It \[is\] a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against the LORD.

19:
