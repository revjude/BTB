[[Lev.15|Leviticus 15:13 - Leviticus 15:18]]
*The Cleansing of Men*

[[Lev.15.13|13]] And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.

13: 

[[Lev.15.14|14]] And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, and come before the LORD unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and give them unto the priest:

14: 

[[Lev.15.15|15]] And the priest shall offer them, the one \[for\] a sin offering, and the other \[for\] a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue.

15: 

[[Lev.15.16|16]] And if any man’s seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even.

16: 

[[Lev.15.17|17]] And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even.

17: 

[[Lev.15.18|18]] The woman also with whom man shall lie \[with\] seed of copulation, they shall \[both\] bathe \[themselves\] in water, and be unclean until the even.

18:
