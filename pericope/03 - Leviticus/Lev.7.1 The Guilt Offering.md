[[Lev.7|Leviticus 7:1 - Leviticus 7:10]]
*The Guilt Offering*

[[Lev.7.1|1]] Likewise this \[is\] the law of the trespass offering: it \[is\] most holy.

1: 

[[Lev.7.2|2]] In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar.

2: 

[[Lev.7.3|3]] And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards,

3: 

[[Lev.7.4|4]] And the two kidneys, and the fat that \[is\] on them, which \[is\] by the flanks, and the caul \[that is\] above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away:

4: 

[[Lev.7.5|5]] And the priest shall burn them upon the altar \[for\] an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it \[is\] a trespass offering.

5: 

[[Lev.7.6|6]] Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place: it \[is\] most holy.

6: 

[[Lev.7.7|7]] As the sin offering \[is\], so \[is\] the trespass offering: \[there is\] one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have \[it\].

7: 

[[Lev.7.8|8]] And the priest that offereth any man’s burnt offering, \[even\] the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered.

8: 

[[Lev.7.9|9]] And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest’s that offereth it.

9: 

[[Lev.7.10|10]] And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one \[as much\] as another.

10:
