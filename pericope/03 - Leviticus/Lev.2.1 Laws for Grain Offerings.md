[[Lev.2|Leviticus 2:1 - Leviticus 2:16]]
*Laws for Grain Offerings*

[[Lev.2.1|1]] And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his offering shall be \[of\] fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:

1: 

[[Lev.2.2|2]] And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, \[to be\] an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD:

2: 

[[Lev.2.3|3]] And the remnant of the meat offering \[shall be\] Aaron’s and his sons’: \[it is\] a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.

3: 

[[Lev.2.4|4]] And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, \[it shall be\] unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.

4: 

[[Lev.2.5|5]] And if thy oblation \[be\] a meat offering \[baken\] in a pan, it shall be \[of\] fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.

5: 

[[Lev.2.6|6]] Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it \[is\] a meat offering.

6: 

[[Lev.2.7|7]] And if thy oblation \[be\] a meat offering \[baken\] in the fryingpan, it shall be made \[of\] fine flour with oil.

7: 

[[Lev.2.8|8]] And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the altar.

8: 

[[Lev.2.9|9]] And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn \[it\] upon the altar: \[it is\] an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

9: 

[[Lev.2.10|10]] And that which is left of the meat offering \[shall be\] Aaron’s and his sons’: \[it is\] a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.

10: 

[[Lev.2.11|11]] No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire.

11: 

[[Lev.2.12|12]] As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.

12: 

[[Lev.2.13|13]] And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.

13: 

[[Lev.2.14|14]] And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, \[even\] corn beaten out of full ears.

14: 

[[Lev.2.15|15]] And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it \[is\] a meat offering.

15: 

[[Lev.2.16|16]] And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, \[part\] of the beaten corn thereof, and \[part\] of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: \[it is\] an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

16:
