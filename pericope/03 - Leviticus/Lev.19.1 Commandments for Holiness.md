[[Lev.19|Leviticus 19:1 - Leviticus 19:8]]
*Commandments for Holiness*

[[Lev.19.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

1: 

[[Lev.19.2|2]] Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God \[am\] holy.

2: 

[[Lev.19.3|3]] Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I \[am\] the LORD your God.

3: 

[[Lev.19.4|4]] Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I \[am\] the LORD your God.

4: 

[[Lev.19.5|5]] And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it at your own will.

5: 

[[Lev.19.6|6]] It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.

6: 

[[Lev.19.7|7]] And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it \[is\] abominable; it shall not be accepted.

7: 

[[Lev.19.8|8]] Therefore \[every one\] that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

8:
