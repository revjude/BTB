[[Lev.14|Leviticus 14:48 - Leviticus 14:57]]
*Cleansing a Home*

[[Lev.14.48|48]] And if the priest shall come in, and look \[upon it\], and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.

48: 

[[Lev.14.49|49]] And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

49: 

[[Lev.14.50|50]] And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:

50: 

[[Lev.14.51|51]] And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:

51: 

[[Lev.14.52|52]] And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:

52: 

[[Lev.14.53|53]] But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean.

53: 

[[Lev.14.54|54]] This \[is\] the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,

54: 

[[Lev.14.55|55]] And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,

55: 

[[Lev.14.56|56]] And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:

56: 

[[Lev.14.57|57]] To teach when \[it is\] unclean, and when \[it is\] clean: this \[is\] the law of leprosy.

57:
