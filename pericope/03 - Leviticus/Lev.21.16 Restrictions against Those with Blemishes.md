[[Lev.21|Leviticus 21:16 - Leviticus 21:24]]
*Restrictions against Those with Blemishes*

[[Lev.21.16|16]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

16: 

[[Lev.21.17|17]] Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever \[he be\] of thy seed in their generations that hath \[any\] blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.

17: 

[[Lev.21.18|18]] For whatsoever man \[he be\] that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,

18: 

[[Lev.21.19|19]] Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,

19: 

[[Lev.21.20|20]] Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;

20: 

[[Lev.21.21|21]] No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.

21: 

[[Lev.21.22|22]] He shall eat the bread of his God, \[both\] of the most holy, and of the holy.

22: 

[[Lev.21.23|23]] Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

23: 

[[Lev.21.24|24]] And Moses told \[it\] unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.

24:
