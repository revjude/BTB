[[Lev.25|Leviticus 25:47 - Leviticus 25:55]]
*Redemption of Servants*

[[Lev.25.47|47]] And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother \[that dwelleth\] by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger \[or\] sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger’s family:

47: 

[[Lev.25.48|48]] After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:

48: 

[[Lev.25.49|49]] Either his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or \[any\] that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.

49: 

[[Lev.25.50|50]] And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.

50: 

[[Lev.25.51|51]] If \[there be\] yet many years \[behind\], according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.

51: 

[[Lev.25.52|52]] And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, \[and\] according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.

52: 

[[Lev.25.53|53]] \[And\] as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: \[and the other\] shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.

53: 

[[Lev.25.54|54]] And if he be not redeemed in these \[years\], then he shall go out in the year of jubile, \[both\] he, and his children with him.

54: 

[[Lev.25.55|55]] For unto me the children of Israel \[are\] servants; they \[are\] my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I \[am\] the LORD your God.

55:
