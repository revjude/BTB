[[Lev.23|Leviticus 23:26 - Leviticus 23:32]]
*The Day of Atonement*

[[Lev.23.26|26]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

26: 

[[Lev.23.27|27]] Also on the tenth \[day\] of this seventh month \[there shall be\] a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

27: 

[[Lev.23.28|28]] And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it \[is\] a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.

28: 

[[Lev.23.29|29]] For whatsoever soul \[it be\] that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.

29: 

[[Lev.23.30|30]] And whatsoever soul \[it be\] that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.

30: 

[[Lev.23.31|31]] Ye shall do no manner of work: \[it shall be\] a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

31: 

[[Lev.23.32|32]] It \[shall be\] unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth \[day\] of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.

32:
