[[Lev.26|Leviticus 26:14 - Leviticus 26:39]]
*Punishments for Disobedience*

[[Lev.26.14|14]] But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;

14: 

[[Lev.26.15|15]] And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, \[but\] that ye break my covenant:

15: 

[[Lev.26.16|16]] I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.

16: 

[[Lev.26.17|17]] And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.

17: 

[[Lev.26.18|18]] And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.

18: 

[[Lev.26.19|19]] And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:

19: 

[[Lev.26.20|20]] And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.

20: 

[[Lev.26.21|21]] And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.

21: 

[[Lev.26.22|22]] I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your \[high\] ways shall be desolate.

22: 

[[Lev.26.23|23]] And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;

23: 

[[Lev.26.24|24]] Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.

24: 

[[Lev.26.25|25]] And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of \[my\] covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.

25: 

[[Lev.26.26|26]] \[And\] when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver \[you\] your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.

26: 

[[Lev.26.27|27]] And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;

27: 

[[Lev.26.28|28]] Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.

28: 

[[Lev.26.29|29]] And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.

29: 

[[Lev.26.30|30]] And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.

30: 

[[Lev.26.31|31]] And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.

31: 

[[Lev.26.32|32]] And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.

32: 

[[Lev.26.33|33]] And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.

33: 

[[Lev.26.34|34]] Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye \[be\] in your enemies’ land; \[even\] then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.

34: 

[[Lev.26.35|35]] As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.

35: 

[[Lev.26.36|36]] And upon them that are left \[alive\] of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.

36: 

[[Lev.26.37|37]] And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.

37: 

[[Lev.26.38|38]] And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.

38: 

[[Lev.26.39|39]] And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.

39:
