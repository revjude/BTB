[[Lev.23|Leviticus 23:9 - Leviticus 23:14]]
*The Feast of Firstfruits*

[[Lev.23.9|9]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

9: 

[[Lev.23.10|10]] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:

10: 

[[Lev.23.11|11]] And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.

11: 

[[Lev.23.12|12]] And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD.

12: 

[[Lev.23.13|13]] And the meat offering thereof \[shall be\] two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD \[for\] a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof \[shall be\] of wine, the fourth \[part\] of an hin.

13: 

[[Lev.23.14|14]] And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: \[it shall be\] a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

14:
