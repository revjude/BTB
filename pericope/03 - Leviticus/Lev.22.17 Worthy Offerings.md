[[Lev.22|Leviticus 22:17 - Leviticus 22:33]]
*Worthy Offerings*

[[Lev.22.17|17]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

17: 

[[Lev.22.18|18]] Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever \[he be\] of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;

18: 

[[Lev.22.19|19]] \[Ye shall offer\] at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.

19: 

[[Lev.22.20|20]] \[But\] whatsoever hath a blemish, \[that\] shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.

20: 

[[Lev.22.21|21]] And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish \[his\] vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.

21: 

[[Lev.22.22|22]] Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.

22: 

[[Lev.22.23|23]] Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer \[for\] a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.

23: 

[[Lev.22.24|24]] Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make \[any offering thereof\] in your land.

24: 

[[Lev.22.25|25]] Neither from a stranger’s hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption \[is\] in them, \[and\] blemishes \[be\] in them: they shall not be accepted for you.

25: 

[[Lev.22.26|26]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

26: 

[[Lev.22.27|27]] When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

27: 

[[Lev.22.28|28]] And \[whether it be\] cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.

28: 

[[Lev.22.29|29]] And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, offer \[it\] at your own will.

29: 

[[Lev.22.30|30]] On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I \[am\] the LORD.

30: 

[[Lev.22.31|31]] Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I \[am\] the LORD.

31: 

[[Lev.22.32|32]] Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I \[am\] the LORD which hallow you,

32: 

[[Lev.22.33|33]] That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I \[am\] the LORD.

33:
