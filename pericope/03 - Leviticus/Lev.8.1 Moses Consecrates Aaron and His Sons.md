[[Lev.8.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

1: 

[[Lev.8.2|2]] Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;

2: 

[[Lev.8.3|3]] And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

3: 

[[Lev.8.4|4]] And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

4: 

[[Lev.8.5|5]] And Moses said unto the congregation, This \[is\] the thing which the LORD commanded to be done.

5: 

[[Lev.8.6|6]] And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.

6: 

[[Lev.8.7|7]] And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound \[it\] unto him therewith.

7: 

[[Lev.8.8|8]] And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.

8: 

[[Lev.8.9|9]] And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, \[even\] upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.

9: 

[[Lev.8.10|10]] And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that \[was\] therein, and sanctified them.

10: 

[[Lev.8.11|11]] And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.

11: 

[[Lev.8.12|12]] And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.

[[Lev.8.13|13]] And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses.

13:
