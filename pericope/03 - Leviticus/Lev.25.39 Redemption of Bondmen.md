[[Lev.25|Leviticus 25:39 - Leviticus 25:46]]
*Redemption of Bondmen*

[[Lev.25.39|39]] And if thy brother \[that dwelleth\] by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:

39: 

[[Lev.25.40|40]] \[But\] as an hired servant, \[and\] as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, \[and\] shall serve thee unto the year of jubile:

40: 

[[Lev.25.41|41]] And \[then\] shall he depart from thee, \[both\] he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.

41: 

[[Lev.25.42|42]] For they \[are\] my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.

42: 

[[Lev.25.43|43]] Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.

43: 

[[Lev.25.44|44]] Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, \[shall be\] of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.

44: 

[[Lev.25.45|45]] Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that \[are\] with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.

45: 

[[Lev.25.46|46]] And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit \[them for\] a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.

46:
