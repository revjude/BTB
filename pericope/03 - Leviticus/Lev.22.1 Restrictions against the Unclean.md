[[Lev.22|Leviticus 22:1 - Leviticus 22:16]]
*Restrictions against the Unclean*

[[Lev.22.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

1: 

[[Lev.22.2|2]] Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name \[in those things\] which they hallow unto me: I \[am\] the LORD.

2: 

[[Lev.22.3|3]] Say unto them, Whosoever \[he be\] of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I \[am\] the LORD.

3: 

[[Lev.22.4|4]] What man soever of the seed of Aaron \[is\] a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing \[that is\] unclean \[by\] the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;

4: 

[[Lev.22.5|5]] Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;

5: 

[[Lev.22.6|6]] The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.

6: 

[[Lev.22.7|7]] And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it \[is\] his food.

7: 

[[Lev.22.8|8]] That which dieth of itself, or is torn \[with beasts\], he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I \[am\] the LORD.

8: 

[[Lev.22.9|9]] They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.

9: 

[[Lev.22.10|10]] There shall no stranger eat \[of\] the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat \[of\] the holy thing.

10: 

[[Lev.22.11|11]] But if the priest buy \[any\] soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.

11: 

[[Lev.22.12|12]] If the priest’s daughter also be \[married\] unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.

12: 

[[Lev.22.13|13]] But if the priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father’s house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father’s meat: but there shall no stranger eat thereof.

13: 

[[Lev.22.14|14]] And if a man eat \[of\] the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth \[part\] thereof unto it, and shall give \[it\] unto the priest with the holy thing.

14: 

[[Lev.22.15|15]] And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;

15: 

[[Lev.22.16|16]] Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

16:
