[[Lev.15|Leviticus 15:1 - Leviticus 15:12]]
*The Uncleanness of Men*

[[Lev.15.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,

1: 

[[Lev.15.2|2]] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath a running issue out of his flesh, \[because of\] his issue he \[is\] unclean.

2: 

[[Lev.15.3|3]] And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it \[is\] his uncleanness.

3: 

[[Lev.15.4|4]] Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean: and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.

4: 

[[Lev.15.5|5]] And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe \[himself\] in water, and be unclean until the even.

5: 

[[Lev.15.6|6]] And he that sitteth on \[any\] thing whereon he sat that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe \[himself\] in water, and be unclean until the even.

6: 

[[Lev.15.7|7]] And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe \[himself\] in water, and be unclean until the even.

7: 

[[Lev.15.8|8]] And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean; then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe \[himself\] in water, and be unclean until the even.

8: 

[[Lev.15.9|9]] And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall be unclean.

9: 

[[Lev.15.10|10]] And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the even: and he that beareth \[any of\] those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe \[himself\] in water, and be unclean until the even.

10: 

[[Lev.15.11|11]] And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe \[himself\] in water, and be unclean until the even.

11: 

[[Lev.15.12|12]] And the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the issue, shall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.

12:
