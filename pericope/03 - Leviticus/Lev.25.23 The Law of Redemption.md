[[Lev.25|Leviticus 25:23 - Leviticus 25:34]]
*The Law of Redemption*

[[Lev.25.23|23]] The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land \[is\] mine; for ye \[are\] strangers and sojourners with me.

23: 

[[Lev.25.24|24]] And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.

24: 

[[Lev.25.25|25]] If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away \[some\] of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.

25: 

[[Lev.25.26|26]] And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;

26: 

[[Lev.25.27|27]] Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.

27: 

[[Lev.25.28|28]] But if he be not able to restore \[it\] to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.

28: 

[[Lev.25.29|29]] And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; \[within\] a full year may he redeem it.

29: 

[[Lev.25.30|30]] And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that \[is\] in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.

30: 

[[Lev.25.31|31]] But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.

31: 

[[Lev.25.32|32]] Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, \[and\] the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.

32: 

[[Lev.25.33|33]] And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in \[the year of\] jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites \[are\] their possession among the children of Israel.

33: 

[[Lev.25.34|34]] But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it \[is\] their perpetual possession.

34:
