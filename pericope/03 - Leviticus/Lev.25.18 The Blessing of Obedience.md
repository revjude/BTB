[[Lev.25|Leviticus 25:18 - Leviticus 25:22]]
*The Blessing of Obedience*

[[Lev.25.18|18]] Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.

18: 

[[Lev.25.19|19]] And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.

19: 

[[Lev.25.20|20]] And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:

20: 

[[Lev.25.21|21]] Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.

21: 

[[Lev.25.22|22]] And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat \[yet\] of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat \[of\] the old \[store\].

22:
