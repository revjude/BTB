[[Lev.14|Leviticus 14:33 - Leviticus 14:47]]
*Signs of Home Contamination*

[[Lev.14.33|33]] And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

33: 

[[Lev.14.34|34]] When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;

34: 

[[Lev.14.35|35]] And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me \[there is\] as it were a plague in the house:

35: 

[[Lev.14.36|36]] Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go \[into it\] to see the plague, that all that \[is\] in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:

36: 

[[Lev.14.37|37]] And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, \[if\] the plague \[be\] in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight \[are\] lower than the wall;

37: 

[[Lev.14.38|38]] Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days:

38: 

[[Lev.14.39|39]] And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, \[if\] the plague be spread in the walls of the house;

39: 

[[Lev.14.40|40]] Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague \[is\], and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city:

40: 

[[Lev.14.41|41]] And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place:

41: 

[[Lev.14.42|42]] And they shall take other stones, and put \[them\] in the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house.

42: 

[[Lev.14.43|43]] And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;

43: 

[[Lev.14.44|44]] Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, \[if\] the plague be spread in the house, it \[is\] a fretting leprosy in the house: it \[is\] unclean.

44: 

[[Lev.14.45|45]] And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry \[them\] forth out of the city into an unclean place.

45: 

[[Lev.14.46|46]] Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.

46: 

[[Lev.14.47|47]] And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.

47:
