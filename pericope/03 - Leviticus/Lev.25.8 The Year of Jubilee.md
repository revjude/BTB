[[Lev.25|Leviticus 25:8 - Leviticus 25:12]]
*The Year of Jubilee*

[[Lev.25.8|8]] And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.

8: 

[[Lev.25.9|9]] Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth \[day\] of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.

9: 

[[Lev.25.10|10]] And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout \[all\] the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.

10: 

[[Lev.25.11|11]] A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather \[the grapes\] in it of thy vine undressed.

11: 

[[Lev.25.12|12]] For it \[is\] the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.

12:
