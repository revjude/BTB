[[2Kgs.16|2 Kings 16:1 - 2 Kings 16:9]]
*Ahaz Reigns in Judah*

[[2Kgs.16.1|1]] In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.

1: 

[[2Kgs.16.2|2]] Twenty years old \[was\] Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not \[that which was\] right in the sight of the LORD his God, like David his father.

2: 

[[2Kgs.16.3|3]] But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.

3: 

[[2Kgs.16.4|4]] And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.

4: 

[[2Kgs.16.5|5]] Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome \[him\].

5: 

[[2Kgs.16.6|6]] At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day.

6: 

[[2Kgs.16.7|7]] So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, I \[am\] thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me.

7: 

[[2Kgs.16.8|8]] And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s house, and sent \[it for\] a present to the king of Assyria.

8: 

[[2Kgs.16.9|9]] And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried \[the people of\] it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.

9:
