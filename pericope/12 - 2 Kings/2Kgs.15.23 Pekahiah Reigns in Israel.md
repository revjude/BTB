[[2Kgs.15|2 Kings 15:23 - 2 Kings 15:26]]
*Pekahiah Reigns in Israel*

[[2Kgs.15.23|23]] In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, \[and reigned\] two years.

23: 

[[2Kgs.15.24|24]] And he did \[that which was\] evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

24: 

[[2Kgs.15.25|25]] But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king’s house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room.

25: 

[[2Kgs.15.26|26]] And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they \[are\] written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

26:
