[[2Kgs.23|2 Kings 23:4 - 2 Kings 23:20]]
*Josiah Destroys Idolatry*

[[2Kgs.23.4|4]] And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel.

4: 

[[2Kgs.23.5|5]] And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.

5: 

[[2Kgs.23.6|6]] And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped \[it\] small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people.

6: 

[[2Kgs.23.7|7]] And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that \[were\] by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.

7: 

[[2Kgs.23.8|8]] And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that \[were\] in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which \[were\] on a man’s left hand at the gate of the city.

8: 

[[2Kgs.23.9|9]] Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren.

9: 

[[2Kgs.23.10|10]] And he defiled Topheth, which \[is\] in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.

10: 

[[2Kgs.23.11|11]] And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which \[was\] in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.

11: 

[[2Kgs.23.12|12]] And the altars that \[were\] on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and brake \[them\] down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.

12: 

[[2Kgs.23.13|13]] And the high places that \[were\] before Jerusalem, which \[were\] on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.

13: 

[[2Kgs.23.14|14]] And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.

14: 

[[2Kgs.23.15|15]] Moreover the altar that \[was\] at Bethel, \[and\] the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, \[and\] stamped \[it\] small to powder, and burned the grove.

15: 

[[2Kgs.23.16|16]] And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that \[were\] there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned \[them\] upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.

16: 

[[2Kgs.23.17|17]] Then he said, What title \[is\] that that I see? And the men of the city told him, \[It is\] the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Bethel.

17: 

[[2Kgs.23.18|18]] And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.

18: 

[[2Kgs.23.19|19]] And all the houses also of the high places that \[were\] in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke \[the LORD\] to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.

19: 

[[2Kgs.23.20|20]] And he slew all the priests of the high places that \[were\] there upon the altars, and burned men’s bones upon them, and returned to Jerusalem.

20:
