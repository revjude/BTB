[[2Kgs.10|2 Kings 10:28 - 2 Kings 10:33]]
*Jehu Repeats Jeroboam’s Sins*

[[2Kgs.10.28|28]] Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.

28: 

[[2Kgs.10.29|29]] Howbeit \[from\] the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, \[to wit\], the golden calves that \[were\] in Bethel, and that \[were\] in Dan.

29: 

[[2Kgs.10.30|30]] And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing \[that which is\] right in mine eyes, \[and\] hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that \[was\] in mine heart, thy children of the fourth \[generation\] shall sit on the throne of Israel.

30: 

[[2Kgs.10.31|31]] But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.

31: 

[[2Kgs.10.32|32]] In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel;

32: 

[[2Kgs.10.33|33]] From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which \[is\] by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.

33:
