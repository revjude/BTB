[[2Kgs.8|2 Kings 8:20 - 2 Kings 8:24]]
*Edom and Libnah Rebel*

[[2Kgs.8.20|20]] In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.

20: 

[[2Kgs.8.21|21]] So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.

21: 

[[2Kgs.8.22|22]] Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.

22: 

[[2Kgs.8.23|23]] And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, \[are\] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

23: 

[[2Kgs.8.24|24]] And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.

24:
