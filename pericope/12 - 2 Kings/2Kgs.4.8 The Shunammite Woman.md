[[2Kgs.4|2 Kings 4:8 - 2 Kings 4:17]]
*The Shunammite Woman*

[[2Kgs.4.8|8]] And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where \[was\] a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And \[so\] it was, \[that\] as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.

8: 

[[2Kgs.4.9|9]] And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this \[is\] an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.

9: 

[[2Kgs.4.10|10]] Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.

10: 

[[2Kgs.4.11|11]] And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.

11: 

[[2Kgs.4.12|12]] And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.

12: 

[[2Kgs.4.13|13]] And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what \[is\] to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.

13: 

[[2Kgs.4.14|14]] And he said, What then \[is\] to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.

14: 

[[2Kgs.4.15|15]] And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.

15: 

[[2Kgs.4.16|16]] And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, \[thou\] man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.

16: 

[[2Kgs.4.17|17]] And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.

17:
