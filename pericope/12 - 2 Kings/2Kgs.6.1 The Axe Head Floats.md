[[2Kgs.6|2 Kings 6:1 - 2 Kings 6:7]]
*The Axe Head Floats*

[[2Kgs.6.1|1]] And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.

1: 

[[2Kgs.6.2|2]] Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.

2: 

[[2Kgs.6.3|3]] And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.

3: 

[[2Kgs.6.4|4]] So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.

4: 

[[2Kgs.6.5|5]] But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.

5: 

[[2Kgs.6.6|6]] And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast \[it\] in thither; and the iron did swim.

6: 

[[2Kgs.6.7|7]] Therefore said he, Take \[it\] up to thee. And he put out his hand, and took it.

7:
