*The Death of Joash*

[[2Kgs.12.17|17]] Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.

17: 

[[2Kgs.12.18|18]] And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold \[that was\] found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king’s house, and sent \[it\] to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.

18: 

[[2Kgs.12.19|19]] And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, \[are\] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

19: 

[[2Kgs.12.20|20]] And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla.

20: 

[[2Kgs.12.21|21]] For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
