[[2Kgs.20|2 Kings 20:12 - 2 Kings 20:19]]
*Hezekiah Shows His Treasures*

[[2Kgs.20.12|12]] At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.

12: 

[[2Kgs.20.13|13]] And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and \[all\] the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.

13: 

[[2Kgs.20.14|14]] Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, \[even\] from Babylon.

14: 

[[2Kgs.20.15|15]] And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All \[the things\] that \[are\] in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.

15: 

[[2Kgs.20.16|16]] And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.

16: 

[[2Kgs.20.17|17]] Behold, the days come, that all that \[is\] in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.

17: 

[[2Kgs.20.18|18]] And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.

18: 

[[2Kgs.20.19|19]] Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good \[is\] the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. And he said, \[Is it\] not \[good\], if peace and truth be in my days?

19:
