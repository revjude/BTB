[[2Kgs.8|2 Kings 8:25 - 2 Kings 8:29]]
*Ahaziah Reigns in Judah*

[[2Kgs.8.25|25]] In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.

25: 

[[2Kgs.8.26|26]] Two and twenty years old \[was\] Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name \[was\] Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.

26: 

[[2Kgs.8.27|27]] And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as \[did\] the house of Ahab: for he \[was\] the son in law of the house of Ahab.

27: 

[[2Kgs.8.28|28]] And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.

28: 

[[2Kgs.8.29|29]] And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
