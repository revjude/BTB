[[2Kgs.15|2 Kings 15:1 - 2 Kings 15:7]]
*Azariah Reigns in Judah*

[[2Kgs.15.1|1]] In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.

1: 

[[2Kgs.15.2|2]] Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name \[was\] Jecholiah of Jerusalem.

2: 

[[2Kgs.15.3|3]] And he did \[that which was\] right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done;

3: 

[[2Kgs.15.4|4]] Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places.

4: 

[[2Kgs.15.5|5]] And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the king’s son \[was\] over the house, judging the people of the land.

5: 

[[2Kgs.15.6|6]] And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, \[are\] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

6: 

[[2Kgs.15.7|7]] So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.

7:
