*Jehoram Reigns in Judah*

[[2Kgs.8.17|17]] Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

17: 

[[2Kgs.8.18|18]] And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.

18: 

[[2Kgs.8.19|19]] Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant’s sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, \[and\] to his children.
