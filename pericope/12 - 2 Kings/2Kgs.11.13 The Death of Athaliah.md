[[2Kgs.11|2 Kings 11:13 - 2 Kings 11:16]]
*The Death of Athaliah*

[[2Kgs.11.13|13]] And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard \[and\] of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.

13: 

[[2Kgs.11.14|14]] And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner \[was\], and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.

14: 

[[2Kgs.11.15|15]] But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.

15: 

[[2Kgs.11.16|16]] And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king’s house: and there was she slain.

16:
