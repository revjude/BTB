[[2Kgs.18|2 Kings 18:13 - 2 Kings 18:16]]
*Sennacherib Invades Judah*

[[2Kgs.18.13|13]] Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.

13: 

[[2Kgs.18.14|14]] And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.

14: 

[[2Kgs.18.15|15]] And Hezekiah gave \[him\] all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s house.

15: 

[[2Kgs.18.16|16]] At that time did Hezekiah cut off \[the gold from\] the doors of the temple of the LORD, and \[from\] the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.

16:
