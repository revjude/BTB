[[2Kgs.13|2 Kings 13:14 - 2 Kings 13:25]]
*Elisha’s Final Prophecy*

[[2Kgs.13.14|14]] Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.

14: 

[[2Kgs.13.15|15]] And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto him bow and arrows.

15: 

[[2Kgs.13.16|16]] And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow. And he put his hand \[upon it\]: and Elisha put his hands upon the king’s hands.

16: 

[[2Kgs.13.17|17]] And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened \[it\]. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD’S deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed \[them\].

17: 

[[2Kgs.13.18|18]] And he said, Take the arrows. And he took \[them\]. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed.

18: 

[[2Kgs.13.19|19]] And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed \[it\]: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria \[but\] thrice.

19: 

[[2Kgs.13.20|20]] And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.

20: 

[[2Kgs.13.21|21]] And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band \[of men\]; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.

21: 

[[2Kgs.13.22|22]] But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.

22: 

[[2Kgs.13.23|23]] And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.

23: 

[[2Kgs.13.24|24]] So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead.

24: 

[[2Kgs.13.25|25]] And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.

25:
