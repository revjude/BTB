[[2Kgs.18|2 Kings 18:1 - 2 Kings 18:12]]
*Hezekiah Destroys Idolatry in Judah*

[[2Kgs.18.1|1]] Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, \[that\] Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.

1: 

[[2Kgs.18.2|2]] Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also \[was\] Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.

2: 

[[2Kgs.18.3|3]] And he did \[that which was\] right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did.

3: 

[[2Kgs.18.4|4]] He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.

4: 

[[2Kgs.18.5|5]] He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor \[any\] that were before him.

5: 

[[2Kgs.18.6|6]] For he clave to the LORD, \[and\] departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.

6: 

[[2Kgs.18.7|7]] And the LORD was with him; \[and\] he prospered whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.

7: 

[[2Kgs.18.8|8]] He smote the Philistines, \[even\] unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.

8: 

[[2Kgs.18.9|9]] And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which \[was\] the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, \[that\] Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.

9: 

[[2Kgs.18.10|10]] And at the end of three years they took it: \[even\] in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that \[is\] the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.

10: 

[[2Kgs.18.11|11]] And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor \[by\] the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:

11: 

[[2Kgs.18.12|12]] Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, \[and\] all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear \[them\], nor do \[them\].

12:
