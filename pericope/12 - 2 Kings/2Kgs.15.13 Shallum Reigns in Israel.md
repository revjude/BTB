*Shallum Reigns in Israel*

[[2Kgs.15.13|13]] Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria.

13: 

[[2Kgs.15.14|14]] For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.

14: 

[[2Kgs.15.15|15]] And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they \[are\] written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

15: 

[[2Kgs.15.16|16]] Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that \[were\] therein, and the coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not \[to him\], therefore he smote \[it; and\] all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.

16:
