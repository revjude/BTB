*Hilkiah Finds the Book of the Law*

[[2Kgs.22.8|8]] And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.

8: 

[[2Kgs.22.9|9]] And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD.

9: 

[[2Kgs.22.10|10]] And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.

10: 

[[2Kgs.22.11|11]] And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.

[[2Kgs.22.12|12]] And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king’s, saying,

12: 

[[2Kgs.22.13|13]] Go ye, inquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great \[is\] the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.

13:
