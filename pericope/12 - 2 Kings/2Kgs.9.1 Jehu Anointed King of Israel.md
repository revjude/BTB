[[2Kgs.9|2 Kings 9:1 - 2 Kings 9:13]]
*Jehu Anointed King of Israel*

[[2Kgs.9.1|1]] And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramothgilead:

1: 

[[2Kgs.9.2|2]] And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;

2: 

[[2Kgs.9.3|3]] Then take the box of oil, and pour \[it\] on his head, and say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.

3: 

[[2Kgs.9.4|4]] So the young man, \[even\] the young man the prophet, went to Ramothgilead.

4: 

[[2Kgs.9.5|5]] And when he came, behold, the captains of the host \[were\] sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.

5: 

[[2Kgs.9.6|6]] And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, \[even\] over Israel.

6: 

[[2Kgs.9.7|7]] And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.

7: 

[[2Kgs.9.8|8]] For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:

8: 

[[2Kgs.9.9|9]] And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:

9: 

[[2Kgs.9.10|10]] And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and \[there shall be\] none to bury \[her\]. And he opened the door, and fled.

10: 

[[2Kgs.9.11|11]] Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and \[one\] said unto him, \[Is\] all well? wherefore came this mad \[fellow\] to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.

11: 

[[2Kgs.9.12|12]] And they said, \[It is\] false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel.

12: 

[[2Kgs.9.13|13]] Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put \[it\] under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.

13:
