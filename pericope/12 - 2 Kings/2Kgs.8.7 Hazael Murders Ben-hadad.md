[[2Kgs.8|2 Kings 8:7 - 2 Kings 8:15]]
*Hazael Murders Ben-hadad*

[[2Kgs.8.7|7]] And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.

7: 

[[2Kgs.8.8|8]] And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?

8: 

[[2Kgs.8.9|9]] So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?

9: 

[[2Kgs.8.10|10]] And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die.

10: 

[[2Kgs.8.11|11]] And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.

11: 

[[2Kgs.8.12|12]] And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.

12: 

[[2Kgs.8.13|13]] And Hazael said, But what, \[is\] thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou \[shalt be\] king over Syria.

13: 

[[2Kgs.8.14|14]] So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me \[that\] thou shouldest surely recover.

14: 

[[2Kgs.8.15|15]] And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped \[it\] in water, and spread \[it\] on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.

15:
