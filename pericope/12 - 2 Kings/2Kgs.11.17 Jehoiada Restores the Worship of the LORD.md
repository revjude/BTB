*Jehoiada Restores the Worship of the LORD*

[[2Kgs.11.17|17]] And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the LORD’S people; between the king also and the people.

17: 

[[2Kgs.11.18|18]] And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD.

18: 

[[2Kgs.11.19|19]] And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king’s house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.

19: 

[[2Kgs.11.20|20]] And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword \[beside\] the king’s house.

20: 

[[2Kgs.11.21|21]] Seven years old \[was\] Jehoash when he began to reign.
