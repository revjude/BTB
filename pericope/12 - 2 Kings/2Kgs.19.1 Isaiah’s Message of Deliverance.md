[[2Kgs.19|2 Kings 19:1 - 2 Kings 19:7]]
*Isaiah’s Message of Deliverance*

[[2Kgs.19.1|1]] And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard \[it\], that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.

1: 

[[2Kgs.19.2|2]] And he sent Eliakim, which \[was\] over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

2: 

[[2Kgs.19.3|3]] And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day \[is\] a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and \[there is\] not strength to bring forth.

3: 

[[2Kgs.19.4|4]] It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up \[thy\] prayer for the remnant that are left.

4: 

[[2Kgs.19.5|5]] So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

5: 

[[2Kgs.19.6|6]] And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.

6: 

[[2Kgs.19.7|7]] Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.

7:
