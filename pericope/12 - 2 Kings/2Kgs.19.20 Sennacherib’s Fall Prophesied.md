[[2Kgs.19|2 Kings 19:20 - 2 Kings 19:34]]
*Sennacherib’s Fall Prophesied*

[[2Kgs.19.20|20]] Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, \[That\] which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.

20: 

[[2Kgs.19.21|21]] This \[is\] the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, \[and\] laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.

21: 

[[2Kgs.19.22|22]] Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted \[thy\] voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? \[even\] against the Holy \[One\] of Israel.

22: 

[[2Kgs.19.23|23]] By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, \[and\] the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, \[and into\] the forest of his Carmel.

23: 

[[2Kgs.19.24|24]] I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.

24: 

[[2Kgs.19.25|25]] Hast thou not heard long ago \[how\] I have done it, \[and\] of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities \[into\] ruinous heaps.

25: 

[[2Kgs.19.26|26]] Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were \[as\] the grass of the field, and \[as\] the green herb, \[as\] the grass on the housetops, and \[as corn\] blasted before it be grown up.

26: 

[[2Kgs.19.27|27]] But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.

27: 

[[2Kgs.19.28|28]] Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.

28: 

[[2Kgs.19.29|29]] And this \[shall be\] a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.

29: 

[[2Kgs.19.30|30]] And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.

30: 

[[2Kgs.19.31|31]] For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD \[of hosts\] shall do this.

31: 

[[2Kgs.19.32|32]] Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.

32: 

[[2Kgs.19.33|33]] By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.

33: 

[[2Kgs.19.34|34]] For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.

34:
