[[2Kgs.24|2 Kings 24:1 - 2 Kings 24:5]]
*Babylon Controls Jehoiakim*

[[2Kgs.24.1|1]] In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.

1: 

[[2Kgs.24.2|2]] And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servants the prophets.

2: 

[[2Kgs.24.3|3]] Surely at the commandment of the LORD came \[this\] upon Judah, to remove \[them\] out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did;

3: 

[[2Kgs.24.4|4]] And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon.

4: 

[[2Kgs.24.5|5]] Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, \[are\] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

5:
