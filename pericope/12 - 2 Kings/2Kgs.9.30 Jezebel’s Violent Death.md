[[2Kgs.9|2 Kings 9:30 - 2 Kings 9:37]]
*Jezebel’s Violent Death*

[[2Kgs.9.30|30]] And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard \[of it\]; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.

30: 

[[2Kgs.9.31|31]] And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, \[Had\] Zimri peace, who slew his master?

31: 

[[2Kgs.9.32|32]] And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who \[is\] on my side? who? And there looked out to him two \[or\] three eunuchs.

32: 

[[2Kgs.9.33|33]] And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and \[some\] of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot.

33: 

[[2Kgs.9.34|34]] And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed \[woman\], and bury her: for she \[is\] a king’s daughter.

34: 

[[2Kgs.9.35|35]] And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of \[her\] hands.

35: 

[[2Kgs.9.36|36]] Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This \[is\] the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:

36: 

[[2Kgs.9.37|37]] And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; \[so\] that they shall not say, This \[is\] Jezebel.

37:
