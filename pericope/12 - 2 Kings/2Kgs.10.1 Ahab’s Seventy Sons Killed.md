[[2Kgs.10|2 Kings 10:1 - 2 Kings 10:17]]
*Ahab’s Seventy Sons Killed*

[[2Kgs.10.1|1]] And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab’s \[children\], saying,

1: 

[[2Kgs.10.2|2]] Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master’s sons \[are\] with you, and \[there are\] with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armour;

2: 

[[2Kgs.10.3|3]] Look even out the best and meetest of your master’s sons, and set \[him\] on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.

3: 

[[2Kgs.10.4|4]] But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?

4: 

[[2Kgs.10.5|5]] And he that \[was\] over the house, and he that \[was\] over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up \[of the children\], sent to Jehu, saying, We \[are\] thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou \[that which is\] good in thine eyes.

5: 

[[2Kgs.10.6|6]] Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye \[be\] mine, and \[if\] ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king’s sons, \[being\] seventy persons, \[were\] with the great men of the city, which brought them up.

6: 

[[2Kgs.10.7|7]] And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king’s sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him \[them\] to Jezreel.

7: 

[[2Kgs.10.8|8]] And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king’s sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.

8: 

[[2Kgs.10.9|9]] And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye \[be\] righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?

9: 

[[2Kgs.10.10|10]] Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD hath done \[that\] which he spake by his servant Elijah.

10: 

[[2Kgs.10.11|11]] So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.

11: 

[[2Kgs.10.12|12]] And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. \[And\] as he \[was\] at the shearing house in the way,

12: 

[[2Kgs.10.13|13]] Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who \[are\] ye? And they answered, We \[are\] the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.

13: 

[[2Kgs.10.14|14]] And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, \[even\] two and forty men; neither left he any of them.

14: 

[[2Kgs.10.15|15]] And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab \[coming\] to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart \[is\] with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give \[me\] thine hand. And he gave \[him\] his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.

15: 

[[2Kgs.10.16|16]] And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot.

16: 

[[2Kgs.10.17|17]] And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spake to Elijah.

17:
