[[2Kgs.25|2 Kings 25:8 - 2 Kings 25:17]]
*The Temple Destroyed*

[[2Kgs.25.8|8]] And in the fifth month, on the seventh \[day\] of the month, which \[is\] the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem:

8: 

[[2Kgs.25.9|9]] And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great \[man’s\] house burnt he with fire.

9: 

[[2Kgs.25.10|10]] And all the army of the Chaldees, that \[were with\] the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.

10: 

[[2Kgs.25.11|11]] Now the rest of the people \[that were\] left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away.

11: 

[[2Kgs.25.12|12]] But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land \[to be\] vinedressers and husbandmen.

12: 

[[2Kgs.25.13|13]] And the pillars of brass that \[were\] in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that \[was\] in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.

13: 

[[2Kgs.25.14|14]] And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.

14: 

[[2Kgs.25.15|15]] And the firepans, and the bowls, \[and\] such things as \[were\] of gold, \[in\] gold, and of silver, \[in\] silver, the captain of the guard took away.

15: 

[[2Kgs.25.16|16]] The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight.

16: 

[[2Kgs.25.17|17]] The height of the one pillar \[was\] eighteen cubits, and the chapiter upon it \[was\] brass: and the height of the chapiter three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work.

17:
