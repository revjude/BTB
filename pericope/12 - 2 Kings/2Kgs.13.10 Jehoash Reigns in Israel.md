[[2Kgs.13|2 Kings 13:10 - 2 Kings 13:13]]
*Jehoash Reigns in Israel*

[[2Kgs.13.10|10]] In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, \[and reigned\] sixteen years.

10: 

[[2Kgs.13.11|11]] And he did \[that which was\] evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin: \[but\] he walked therein.

11: 

[[2Kgs.13.12|12]] And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, \[are\] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

12: 

[[2Kgs.13.13|13]] And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.

13:
