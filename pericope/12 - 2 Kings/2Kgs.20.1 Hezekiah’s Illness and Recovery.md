[[2Kgs.20|2 Kings 20:1 - 2 Kings 20:11]]
*Hezekiah’s Illness and Recovery*

[[2Kgs.20.1|1]] In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.

1: 

[[2Kgs.20.2|2]] Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying,

2: 

[[2Kgs.20.3|3]] I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done \[that which is\] good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.

3: 

[[2Kgs.20.4|4]] And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,

4: 

[[2Kgs.20.5|5]] Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD.

5: 

[[2Kgs.20.6|6]] And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.

6: 

[[2Kgs.20.7|7]] And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid \[it\] on the boil, and he recovered.

7: 

[[2Kgs.20.8|8]] And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What \[shall be\] the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?

8: 

[[2Kgs.20.9|9]] And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?

9: 

[[2Kgs.20.10|10]] And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.

10: 

[[2Kgs.20.11|11]] And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.

11:
