[[2Kgs.22|2 Kings 22:14 - 2 Kings 22:20]]
*Huldah’s Prophecy*

[[2Kgs.22.14|14]] So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.

14: 

[[2Kgs.22.15|15]] And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,

15: 

[[2Kgs.22.16|16]] Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, \[even\] all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read:

16: 

[[2Kgs.22.17|17]] Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.

17: 

[[2Kgs.22.18|18]] But to the king of Judah which sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, \[As touching\] the words which thou hast heard;

18: 

[[2Kgs.22.19|19]] Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard \[thee\], saith the LORD.

19: 

[[2Kgs.22.20|20]] Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.

20:
