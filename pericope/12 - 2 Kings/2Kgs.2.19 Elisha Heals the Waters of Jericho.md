[[2Kgs.2|2 Kings 2:19 - 2 Kings 2:22]]
*Elisha Heals the Waters of Jericho*

[[2Kgs.2.19|19]] And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city \[is\] pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water \[is\] naught, and the ground barren.

19: 

[[2Kgs.2.20|20]] And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought \[it\] to him.

20: 

[[2Kgs.2.21|21]] And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren \[land\].

21: 

[[2Kgs.2.22|22]] So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.

22:
