[[2Kgs.7|2 Kings 7:16 - 2 Kings 7:20]]
*Elisha’s Prophecy Fulfilled*

[[2Kgs.7.16|16]] And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was \[sold\] for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.

16: 

[[2Kgs.7.17|17]] And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.

17: 

[[2Kgs.7.18|18]] And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:

18: 

[[2Kgs.7.19|19]] And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, \[if\] the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.

19: 

[[2Kgs.7.20|20]] And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died.

20:
