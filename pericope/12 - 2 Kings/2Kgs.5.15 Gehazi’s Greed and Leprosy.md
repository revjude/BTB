[[2Kgs.5|2 Kings 5:15 - 2 Kings 5:27]]
*Gehazi’s Greed and Leprosy*

[[2Kgs.5.15|15]] And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that \[there is\] no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.

15: 

[[2Kgs.5.16|16]] But he said, \[As\] the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take \[it\]; but he refused.

16: 

[[2Kgs.5.17|17]] And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules’ burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD.

17: 

[[2Kgs.5.18|18]] In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, \[that\] when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.

18: 

[[2Kgs.5.19|19]] And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.

19: 

[[2Kgs.5.20|20]] But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, \[as\] the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.

20: 

[[2Kgs.5.21|21]] So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw \[him\] running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, \[Is\] all well?

21: 

[[2Kgs.5.22|22]] And he said, All \[is\] well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.

22: 

[[2Kgs.5.23|23]] And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid \[them\] upon two of his servants; and they bare \[them\] before him.

23: 

[[2Kgs.5.24|24]] And when he came to the tower, he took \[them\] from their hand, and bestowed \[them\] in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.

24: 

[[2Kgs.5.25|25]] But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence \[comest thou\], Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither.

25: 

[[2Kgs.5.26|26]] And he said unto him, Went not mine heart \[with thee\], when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? \[Is it\] a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?

26: 

[[2Kgs.5.27|27]] The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper \[as white\] as snow.

27:
