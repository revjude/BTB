[[2Kgs.21|2 Kings 21:1 - 2 Kings 21:9]]
*Manasseh Reigns in Judah*

[[2Kgs.21.1|1]] Manasseh \[was\] twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name \[was\] Hephzibah.

1: 

[[2Kgs.21.2|2]] And he did \[that which was\] evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.

2: 

[[2Kgs.21.3|3]] For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.

3: 

[[2Kgs.21.4|4]] And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.

4: 

[[2Kgs.21.5|5]] And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.

5: 

[[2Kgs.21.6|6]] And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke \[him\] to anger.

6: 

[[2Kgs.21.7|7]] And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:

7: 

[[2Kgs.21.8|8]] Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.

8: 

[[2Kgs.21.9|9]] But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel.

9:
