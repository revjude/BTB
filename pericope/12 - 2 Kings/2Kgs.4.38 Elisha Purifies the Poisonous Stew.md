[[2Kgs.4|2 Kings 4:38 - 2 Kings 4:41]]
*Elisha Purifies the Poisonous Stew*

[[2Kgs.4.38|38]] And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and \[there was\] a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets \[were\] sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.

38: 

[[2Kgs.4.39|39]] And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred \[them\] into the pot of pottage: for they knew \[them\] not.

39: 

[[2Kgs.4.40|40]] So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O \[thou\] man of God, \[there is\] death in the pot. And they could not eat \[thereof\].

40: 

[[2Kgs.4.41|41]] But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast \[it\] into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.

41:
