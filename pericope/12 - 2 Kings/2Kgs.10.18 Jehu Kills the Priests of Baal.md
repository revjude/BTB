[[2Kgs.10|2 Kings 10:18 - 2 Kings 10:27]]
*Jehu Kills the Priests of Baal*

[[2Kgs.10.18|18]] And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; \[but\] Jehu shall serve him much.

18: 

[[2Kgs.10.19|19]] Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice \[to do\] to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did \[it\] in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.

19: 

[[2Kgs.10.20|20]] And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed \[it\].

20: 

[[2Kgs.10.21|21]] And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.

21: 

[[2Kgs.10.22|22]] And he said unto him that \[was\] over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.

22: 

[[2Kgs.10.23|23]] And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.

23: 

[[2Kgs.10.24|24]] And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, \[If\] any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, \[he that letteth him go\], his life \[shall be\] for the life of him.

24: 

[[2Kgs.10.25|25]] And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, \[and\] slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast \[them\] out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.

25: 

[[2Kgs.10.26|26]] And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.

26: 

[[2Kgs.10.27|27]] And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.

27:
