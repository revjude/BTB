[[2Kgs.4|2 Kings 4:42 - 2 Kings 4:44]]
*Feeding a Hundred Men*

[[2Kgs.4.42|42]] And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.

42: 

[[2Kgs.4.43|43]] And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave \[thereof\].

43: 

[[2Kgs.4.44|44]] So he set \[it\] before them, and they did eat, and left \[thereof\], according to the word of the LORD.

44:
