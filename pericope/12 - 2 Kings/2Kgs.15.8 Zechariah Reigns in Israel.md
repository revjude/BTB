[[2Kgs.15|2 Kings 15:8 - 2 Kings 15:12]]
*Zechariah Reigns in Israel*

[[2Kgs.15.8|8]] In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.

8: 

[[2Kgs.15.9|9]] And he did \[that which was\] evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

9: 

[[2Kgs.15.10|10]] And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.

10: 

[[2Kgs.15.11|11]] And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they \[are\] written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

11: 

[[2Kgs.15.12|12]] This \[was\] the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu, saying, Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth \[generation\]. And so it came to pass.

12:
