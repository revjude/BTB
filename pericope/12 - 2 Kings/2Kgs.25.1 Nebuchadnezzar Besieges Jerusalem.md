*Nebuchadnezzar Besieges Jerusalem*

[[2Kgs.25.1|1]] And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth \[day\] of the month, \[that\] Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about.

[[2Kgs.25.2|2]] And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.

2: 

[[2Kgs.25.3|3]] And on the ninth \[day\] of the \[fourth\] month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.

3: 

[[2Kgs.25.4|4]] And the city was broken up, and all the men of war \[fled\] by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which \[is\] by the king’s garden: (now the Chaldees \[were\] against the city round about:) and \[the king\] went the way toward the plain.

4: 

[[2Kgs.25.5|5]] And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him.

[[2Kgs.25.7|7]] And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.

7:
