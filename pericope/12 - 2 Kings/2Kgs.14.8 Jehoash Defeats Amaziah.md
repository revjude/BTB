[[2Kgs.14|2 Kings 14:8 - 2 Kings 14:14]]
*Jehoash Defeats Amaziah*

[[2Kgs.14.8|8]] Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.

8: 

[[2Kgs.14.9|9]] And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that \[was\] in Lebanon sent to the cedar that \[was\] in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that \[was\] in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.

9: 

[[2Kgs.14.10|10]] Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee up: glory \[of this\], and tarry at home: for why shouldest thou meddle to \[thy\] hurt, that thou shouldest fall, \[even\] thou, and Judah with thee?

10: 

[[2Kgs.14.11|11]] But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Bethshemesh, which \[belongeth\] to Judah.

11: 

[[2Kgs.14.12|12]] And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents.

12: 

[[2Kgs.14.13|13]] And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

13: 

[[2Kgs.14.14|14]] And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.

14:
