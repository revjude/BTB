[[2Kgs.14|2 Kings 14:23 - 2 Kings 14:29]]
*Jeroboam II Reigns in Israel*

[[2Kgs.14.23|23]] In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, \[and reigned\] forty and one years.

23: 

[[2Kgs.14.24|24]] And he did \[that which was\] evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

24: 

[[2Kgs.14.25|25]] He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which \[was\] of Gathhepher.

25: 

[[2Kgs.14.26|26]] For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, \[that it was\] very bitter: for \[there was\] not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel.

26: 

[[2Kgs.14.27|27]] And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.

27: 

[[2Kgs.14.28|28]] Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, \[which belonged\] to Judah, for Israel, \[are\] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

28: 

[[2Kgs.14.29|29]] And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, \[even\] with the kings of Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.

29:
