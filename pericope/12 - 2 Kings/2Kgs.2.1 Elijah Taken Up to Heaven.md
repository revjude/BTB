[[2Kgs.2|2 Kings 2:1 - 2 Kings 2:14]]
*Elijah Taken Up to Heaven*

[[2Kgs.2.1|1]] And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.

1: 

[[2Kgs.2.2|2]] And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said \[unto him, As\] the LORD liveth, and \[as\] thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel.

2: 

[[2Kgs.2.3|3]] And the sons of the prophets that \[were\] at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know \[it\]; hold ye your peace.

3: 

[[2Kgs.2.4|4]] And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, \[As\] the LORD liveth, and \[as\] thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.

4: 

[[2Kgs.2.5|5]] And the sons of the prophets that \[were\] at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know \[it\]; hold ye your peace.

5: 

[[2Kgs.2.6|6]] And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, \[As\] the LORD liveth, and \[as\] thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.

6: 

[[2Kgs.2.7|7]] And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.

7: 

[[2Kgs.2.8|8]] And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped \[it\] together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.

8: 

[[2Kgs.2.9|9]] And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.

9: 

[[2Kgs.2.10|10]] And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: \[nevertheless\], if thou see me \[when I am\] taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be \[so\].

10: 

[[2Kgs.2.11|11]] And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, \[there appeared\] a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.

11: 

[[2Kgs.2.12|12]] And Elisha saw \[it\], and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.

12: 

[[2Kgs.2.13|13]] He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;

13: 

[[2Kgs.2.14|14]] And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where \[is\] the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.

14:
