[[2Kgs.15|2 Kings 15:27 - 2 Kings 15:31]]
*Pekah Reigns in Israel*

[[2Kgs.15.27|27]] In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, \[and reigned\] twenty years.

27: 

[[2Kgs.15.28|28]] And he did \[that which was\] evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

28: 

[[2Kgs.15.29|29]] In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.

29: 

[[2Kgs.15.30|30]] And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.

30: 

[[2Kgs.15.31|31]] And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they \[are\] written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

31:
