[[2Kgs.21|2 Kings 21:10 - 2 Kings 21:18]]
*Manasseh’s Idolatries Rebuked*

[[2Kgs.21.10|10]] And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying,

10: 

[[2Kgs.21.11|11]] Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, \[and\] hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which \[were\] before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols:

11: 

[[2Kgs.21.12|12]] Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I \[am\] bringing \[such\] evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.

12: 

[[2Kgs.21.13|13]] And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as \[a man\] wipeth a dish, wiping \[it\], and turning \[it\] upside down.

13: 

[[2Kgs.21.14|14]] And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;

14: 

[[2Kgs.21.15|15]] Because they have done \[that which was\] evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.

15: 

[[2Kgs.21.16|16]] Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing \[that which was\] evil in the sight of the LORD.

16: 

[[2Kgs.21.17|17]] Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, \[are\] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

17: 

[[2Kgs.21.18|18]] And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.

18:
