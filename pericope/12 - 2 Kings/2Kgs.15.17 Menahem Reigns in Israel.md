[[2Kgs.15|2 Kings 15:17 - 2 Kings 15:22]]
*Menahem Reigns in Israel*

[[2Kgs.15.17|17]] In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, \[and reigned\] ten years in Samaria.

17: 

[[2Kgs.15.18|18]] And he did \[that which was\] evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

18: 

[[2Kgs.15.19|19]] \[And\] Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.

19: 

[[2Kgs.15.20|20]] And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, \[even\] of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land.

20: 

[[2Kgs.15.21|21]] And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, \[are\] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

21: 

[[2Kgs.15.22|22]] And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead.

22:
