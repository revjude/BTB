[[2Kgs.15|2 Kings 15:32 - 2 Kings 15:38]]
*Jotham Reigns in Judah*

[[2Kgs.15.32|32]] In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.

32: 

[[2Kgs.15.33|33]] Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name \[was\] Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.

33: 

[[2Kgs.15.34|34]] And he did \[that which was\] right in the sight of the LORD: he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.

34: 

[[2Kgs.15.35|35]] Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of the house of the LORD.

35: 

[[2Kgs.15.36|36]] Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, \[are\] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

36: 

[[2Kgs.15.37|37]] In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.

37: 

[[2Kgs.15.38|38]] And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.

38:
