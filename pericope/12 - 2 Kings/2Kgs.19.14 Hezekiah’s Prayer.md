[[2Kgs.19|2 Kings 19:14 - 2 Kings 19:19]]
*Hezekiah’s Prayer*

[[2Kgs.19.14|14]] And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.

14: 

[[2Kgs.19.15|15]] And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwellest \[between\] the cherubims, thou art the God, \[even\] thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.

15: 

[[2Kgs.19.16|16]] LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God.

16: 

[[2Kgs.19.17|17]] Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,

17: 

[[2Kgs.19.18|18]] And have cast their gods into the fire: for they \[were\] no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.

18: 

[[2Kgs.19.19|19]] Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou \[art\] the LORD God, \[even\] thou only.

19:
