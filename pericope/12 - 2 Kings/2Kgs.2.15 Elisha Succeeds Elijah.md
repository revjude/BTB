[[2Kgs.2|2 Kings 2:15 - 2 Kings 2:18]]
*Elisha Succeeds Elijah*

[[2Kgs.2.15|15]] And when the sons of the prophets which \[were\] to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.

15: 

[[2Kgs.2.16|16]] And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.

16: 

[[2Kgs.2.17|17]] And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.

17: 

[[2Kgs.2.18|18]] And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?

18:
