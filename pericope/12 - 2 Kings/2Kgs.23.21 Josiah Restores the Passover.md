[[2Kgs.23|2 Kings 23:21 - 2 Kings 23:27]]
*Josiah Restores the Passover*

[[2Kgs.23.21|21]] And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the LORD your God, as \[it is\] written in the book of this covenant.

21: 

[[2Kgs.23.22|22]] Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;

22: 

[[2Kgs.23.23|23]] But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, \[wherein\] this passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem.

23: 

[[2Kgs.23.24|24]] Moreover the \[workers with\] familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.

24: 

[[2Kgs.23.25|25]] And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there \[any\] like him.

25: 

[[2Kgs.23.26|26]] Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.

26: 

[[2Kgs.23.27|27]] And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.

27:
