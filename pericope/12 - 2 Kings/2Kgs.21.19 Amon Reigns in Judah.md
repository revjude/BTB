[[2Kgs.21|2 Kings 21:19 - 2 Kings 21:26]]
*Amon Reigns in Judah*

[[2Kgs.21.19|19]] Amon \[was\] twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name \[was\] Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.

19: 

[[2Kgs.21.20|20]] And he did \[that which was\] evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh did.

20: 

[[2Kgs.21.21|21]] And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:

21: 

[[2Kgs.21.22|22]] And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD.

22: 

[[2Kgs.21.23|23]] And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house.

23: 

[[2Kgs.21.24|24]] And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.

24: 

[[2Kgs.21.25|25]] Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, \[are\] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

25: 

[[2Kgs.21.26|26]] And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.

26:
