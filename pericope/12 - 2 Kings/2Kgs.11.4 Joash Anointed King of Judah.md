[[2Kgs.11|2 Kings 11:4 - 2 Kings 11:12]]
*Joash Anointed King of Judah*

[[2Kgs.11.4|4]] And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king’s son.

4: 

[[2Kgs.11.5|5]] And he commanded them, saying, This \[is\] the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king’s house;

5: 

[[2Kgs.11.6|6]] And a third part \[shall be\] at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.

6: 

[[2Kgs.11.7|7]] And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.

7: 

[[2Kgs.11.8|8]] And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.

8: 

[[2Kgs.11.9|9]] And the captains over the hundreds did according to all \[things\] that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.

9: 

[[2Kgs.11.10|10]] And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David’s spears and shields, that \[were\] in the temple of the LORD.

10: 

[[2Kgs.11.11|11]] And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, \[along\] by the altar and the temple.

11: 

[[2Kgs.11.12|12]] And he brought forth the king’s son, and put the crown upon him, and \[gave him\] the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king.

12:
