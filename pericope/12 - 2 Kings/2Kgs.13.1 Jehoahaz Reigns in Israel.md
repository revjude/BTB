[[2Kgs.13|2 Kings 13:1 - 2 Kings 13:9]]
*Jehoahaz Reigns in Israel*

[[2Kgs.13.1|1]] In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, \[and reigned\] seventeen years.

1: 

[[2Kgs.13.2|2]] And he did \[that which was\] evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.

2: 

[[2Kgs.13.3|3]] And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all \[their\] days.

3: 

[[2Kgs.13.4|4]] And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.

4: 

[[2Kgs.13.5|5]] (And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as beforetime.

5: 

[[2Kgs.13.6|6]] Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, \[but\] walked therein: and there remained the grove also in Samaria.)

6: 

[[2Kgs.13.7|7]] Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.

7: 

[[2Kgs.13.8|8]] Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, \[are\] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

8: 

[[2Kgs.13.9|9]] And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.

9:
