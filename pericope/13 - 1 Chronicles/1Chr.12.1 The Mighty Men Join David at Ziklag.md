[[1Chr.12|1 Chronicles 12:1 - 1 Chronicles 12:22]]
*The Mighty Men Join David at Ziklag*

[[1Chr.12.1|1]] Now these \[are\] they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they \[were\] among the mighty men, helpers of the war.

1: 

[[1Chr.12.2|2]] \[They were\] armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in \[hurling\] stones and \[shooting\] arrows out of a bow, \[even\] of Saul’s brethren of Benjamin.

2: 

[[1Chr.12.3|3]] The chief \[was\] Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite,

3: 

[[1Chr.12.4|4]] And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad the Gederathite,

4: 

[[1Chr.12.5|5]] Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite,

5: 

[[1Chr.12.6|6]] Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites,

6: 

[[1Chr.12.7|7]] And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.

7: 

[[1Chr.12.8|8]] And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the hold to the wilderness men of might, \[and\] men of war \[fit\] for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces \[were like\] the faces of lions, and \[were\] as swift as the roes upon the mountains;

8: 

[[1Chr.12.9|9]] Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,

9: 

[[1Chr.12.10|10]] Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,

10: 

[[1Chr.12.11|11]] Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,

11: 

[[1Chr.12.12|12]] Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,

12: 

[[1Chr.12.13|13]] Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.

13: 

[[1Chr.12.14|14]] These \[were\] of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least \[was\] over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.

14: 

[[1Chr.12.15|15]] These \[are\] they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all \[them\] of the valleys, \[both\] toward the east, and toward the west.

15: 

[[1Chr.12.16|16]] And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David.

16: 

[[1Chr.12.17|17]] And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but if \[ye be come\] to betray me to mine enemies, seeing \[there is\] no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look \[thereon\], and rebuke \[it\].

17: 

[[1Chr.12.18|18]] Then the spirit came upon Amasai, \[who was\] chief of the captains, \[and he said\], Thine \[are we\], David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace \[be\] unto thee, and peace \[be\] to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.

18: 

[[1Chr.12.19|19]] And there fell \[some\] of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to \[the jeopardy of\] our heads.

19: 

[[1Chr.12.20|20]] As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that \[were\] of Manasseh.

20: 

[[1Chr.12.21|21]] And they helped David against the band \[of the rovers\]: for they \[were\] all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.

21: 

[[1Chr.12.22|22]] For at \[that\] time day by day there came to David to help him, until \[it was\] a great host, like the host of God.
