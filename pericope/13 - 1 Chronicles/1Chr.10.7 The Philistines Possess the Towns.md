[[1Chr.10|1 Chronicles 10:7 - 1 Chronicles 10:10]]
*The Philistines Possess the Towns*

[[1Chr.10.7|7]] And when all the men of Israel that \[were\] in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.

7: 

[[1Chr.10.8|8]] And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.

8: 

[[1Chr.10.9|9]] And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.

9: 

[[1Chr.10.10|10]] And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.
