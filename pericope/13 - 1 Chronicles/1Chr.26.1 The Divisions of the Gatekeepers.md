*The Divisions of the Gatekeepers*

[[1Chr.26.1|1]] Concerning the divisions of the porters: Of the Korhites \[was\] Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.

1: 

[[1Chr.26.2|2]] And the sons of Meshelemiah \[were\], Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,

2: 

[[1Chr.26.3|3]] Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Elioenai the seventh.

3: 

[[1Chr.26.4|4]] Moreover the sons of Obededom \[were\], Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth, and Nethaneel the fifth,

4: 

[[1Chr.26.5|5]] Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth: for God blessed him.

5: 

[[1Chr.26.6|6]] Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled throughout the house of their father: for they \[were\] mighty men of valour.

6: 

[[1Chr.26.7|7]] The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose brethren \[were\] strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah.

7: 

[[1Chr.26.8|8]] All these of the sons of Obededom: they and their sons and their brethren, able men for strength for the service, \[were\] threescore and two of Obededom.

8: 

[[1Chr.26.9|9]] And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, strong men, eighteen.

9: 

[[1Chr.26.10|10]] Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the chief, (for \[though\] he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him the chief;)

10: 

[[1Chr.26.11|11]] Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth: all the sons and brethren of Hosah \[were\] thirteen.

11: 

[[1Chr.26.12|12]] Among these \[were\] the divisions of the porters, \[even\] among the chief men, \[having\] wards one against another, to minister in the house of the LORD.

12: 

[[1Chr.26.13|13]] And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to the house of their fathers, for every gate.

13: 

[[1Chr.26.14|14]] And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counseller, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward.

14: 

[[1Chr.26.15|15]] To Obededom southward; and to his sons the house of Asuppim.

15: 

[[1Chr.26.16|16]] To Shuppim and Hosah \[the lot came forth\] westward, with the gate Shallecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward against ward.

16: 

[[1Chr.26.17|17]] Eastward \[were\] six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and toward Asuppim two \[and\] two.

17: 

[[1Chr.26.18|18]] At Parbar westward, four at the causeway, \[and\] two at Parbar.

18: 

[[1Chr.26.19|19]] These \[are\] the divisions of the porters among the sons of Kore, and among the sons of Merari.
