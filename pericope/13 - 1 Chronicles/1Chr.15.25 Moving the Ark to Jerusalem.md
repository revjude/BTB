[[1Chr.15|1 Chronicles 15:25 - 1 Chronicles 15:28]]
*Moving the Ark to Jerusalem*

[[1Chr.15.25|25]] So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy.

25: 

[[1Chr.15.26|26]] And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.

26: 

[[1Chr.15.27|27]] And David \[was\] clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also \[had\] upon him an ephod of linen.

27: 

[[1Chr.15.28|28]] Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.

28:
