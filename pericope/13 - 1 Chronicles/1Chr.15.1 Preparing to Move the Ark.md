[[1Chr.15|1 Chronicles 15:1 - 1 Chronicles 15:13]]
*Preparing to Move the Ark*

[[1Chr.15.1|1]] And \[David\] made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.

1: 

[[1Chr.15.2|2]] Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.

2: 

[[1Chr.15.3|3]] And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.

3: 

[[1Chr.15.4|4]] And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:

4: 

[[1Chr.15.5|5]] Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty:

5: 

[[1Chr.15.6|6]] Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:

6: 

[[1Chr.15.7|7]] Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty:

7: 

[[1Chr.15.8|8]] Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:

8: 

[[1Chr.15.9|9]] Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:

9: 

[[1Chr.15.10|10]] Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve.

10: 

[[1Chr.15.11|11]] And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,

11: 

[[1Chr.15.12|12]] And said unto them, Ye \[are\] the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, \[both\] ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto \[the place that\] I have prepared for it.

12: 

[[1Chr.15.13|13]] For because ye \[did it\] not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.

13:
