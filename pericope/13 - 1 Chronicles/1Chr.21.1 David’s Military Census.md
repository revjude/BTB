[[1Chr.21|1 Chronicles 21:1 - 1 Chronicles 21:6]]
*David’s Military Census*

[[1Chr.21.1|1]] And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.

1: 

[[1Chr.21.2|2]] And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know \[it\].

2: 

[[1Chr.21.3|3]] And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they \[be\]: but, my lord the king, \[are\] they not all my lord’s servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?

3: 

[[1Chr.21.4|4]] Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.

4: 

[[1Chr.21.5|5]] And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all \[they of\] Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah \[was\] four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.

5: 

[[1Chr.21.6|6]] But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.

6:
