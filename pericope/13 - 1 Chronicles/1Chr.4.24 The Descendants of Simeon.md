[[1Chr.4|1 Chronicles 4:24 - 1 Chronicles 4:43]]
*The Descendants of Simeon*

[[1Chr.4.24|24]] The sons of Simeon \[were\], Nemuel, and Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, \[and\] Shaul:

24: 

[[1Chr.4.25|25]] Shallum his son, Mibsam his son, Mishma his son.

25: 

[[1Chr.4.26|26]] And the sons of Mishma; Hamuel his son, Zacchur his son, Shimei his son.

26: 

[[1Chr.4.27|27]] And Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters; but his brethren had not many children, neither did all their family multiply, like to the children of Judah.

27: 

[[1Chr.4.28|28]] And they dwelt at Beersheba, and Moladah, and Hazarshual,

28: 

[[1Chr.4.29|29]] And at Bilhah, and at Ezem, and at Tolad,

29: 

[[1Chr.4.30|30]] And at Bethuel, and at Hormah, and at Ziklag,

30: 

[[1Chr.4.31|31]] And at Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusim, and at Bethbirei, and at Shaaraim. These \[were\] their cities unto the reign of David.

31: 

[[1Chr.4.32|32]] And their villages \[were\], Etam, and Ain, Rimmon, and Tochen, and Ashan, five cities:

32: 

[[1Chr.4.33|33]] And all their villages that \[were\] round about the same cities, unto Baal. These \[were\] their habitations, and their genealogy.

33: 

[[1Chr.4.34|34]] And Meshobab, and Jamlech, and Joshah the son of Amaziah,

34: 

[[1Chr.4.35|35]] And Joel, and Jehu the son of Josibiah, the son of Seraiah, the son of Asiel,

35: 

[[1Chr.4.36|36]] And Elioenai, and Jaakobah, and Jeshohaiah, and Asaiah, and Adiel, and Jesimiel, and Benaiah,

36: 

[[1Chr.4.37|37]] And Ziza the son of Shiphi, the son of Allon, the son of Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah;

37: 

[[1Chr.4.38|38]] These mentioned by \[their\] names \[were\] princes in their families: and the house of their fathers increased greatly.

38: 

[[1Chr.4.39|39]] And they went to the entrance of Gedor, \[even\] unto the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.

39: 

[[1Chr.4.40|40]] And they found fat pasture and good, and the land \[was\] wide, and quiet, and peaceable; for \[they\] of Ham had dwelt there of old.

40: 

[[1Chr.4.41|41]] And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were found there, and destroyed them utterly unto this day, and dwelt in their rooms: because \[there was\] pasture there for their flocks.

41: 

[[1Chr.4.42|42]] And \[some\] of them, \[even\] of the sons of Simeon, five hundred men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.

42: 

[[1Chr.4.43|43]] And they smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped, and dwelt there unto this day.

43:
