[[1Chr.5|1 Chronicles 5:11 - 1 Chronicles 5:22]]
*The Descendants of Gad*

[[1Chr.5.11|11]] And the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land of Bashan unto Salchah:

11: 

[[1Chr.5.12|12]] Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat in Bashan.

12: 

[[1Chr.5.13|13]] And their brethren of the house of their fathers \[were\], Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jachan, and Zia, and Heber, seven.

13: 

[[1Chr.5.14|14]] These \[are\] the children of Abihail the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz;

14: 

[[1Chr.5.15|15]] Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of the house of their fathers.

15: 

[[1Chr.5.16|16]] And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in all the suburbs of Sharon, upon their borders.

16: 

[[1Chr.5.17|17]] All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.

17: 

[[1Chr.5.18|18]] The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, and to shoot with bow, and skilful in war, \[were\] four and forty thousand seven hundred and threescore, that went out to the war.

18: 

[[1Chr.5.19|19]] And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish, and Nodab.

19: 

[[1Chr.5.20|20]] And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that \[were\] with them: for they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them; because they put their trust in him.

20: 

[[1Chr.5.21|21]] And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of men an hundred thousand.

21: 

[[1Chr.5.22|22]] For there fell down many slain, because the war \[was\] of God. And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity.

22:
