20: 

[[1Chr.26.21|21]] \[As concerning\] the sons of Laadan; the sons of the Gershonite Laadan, chief fathers, \[even\] of Laadan the Gershonite, \[were\] Jehieli.

21: 

[[1Chr.26.22|22]] The sons of Jehieli; Zetham, and Joel his brother, \[which were\] over the treasures of the house of the LORD.

22: 

[[1Chr.26.23|23]] Of the Amramites, \[and\] the Izharites, the Hebronites, \[and\] the Uzzielites:

23: 

[[1Chr.26.24|24]] And Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, \[was\] ruler of the treasures.

24: 

[[1Chr.26.25|25]] And his brethren by Eliezer; Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son.

25: 

[[1Chr.26.26|26]] Which Shelomith and his brethren \[were\] over all the treasures of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the chief fathers, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the host, had dedicated.

26: 

[[1Chr.26.27|27]] Out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain the house of the LORD.

27: 

[[1Chr.26.28|28]] And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated; \[and\] whosoever had dedicated \[any thing, it was\] under the hand of Shelomith, and of his brethren.

28: 

[[1Chr.26.29|29]] Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons \[were\] for the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges.

30: 

[[1Chr.26.31|31]] Among the Hebronites \[was\] Jerijah the chief, \[even\] among the Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for, and there were found among them mighty men of valour at Jazer of Gilead.

31: 

[[1Chr.26.32|32]] And his brethren, men of valour, \[were\] two thousand and seven hundred chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the king.
