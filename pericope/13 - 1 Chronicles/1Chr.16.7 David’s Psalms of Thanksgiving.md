[[1Chr.16|1 Chronicles 16:7 - 1 Chronicles 16:22]]
*David’s Psalms of Thanksgiving*

[[1Chr.16.7|7]] Then on that day David delivered first \[this psalm\] to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.

7: 

[[1Chr.16.8|8]] Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.

8: 

[[1Chr.16.9|9]] Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.

9: 

[[1Chr.16.10|10]] Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.

10: 

[[1Chr.16.11|11]] Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.

11: 

[[1Chr.16.12|12]] Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;

12: 

[[1Chr.16.13|13]] O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.

13: 

[[1Chr.16.14|14]] He \[is\] the LORD our God; his judgments \[are\] in all the earth.

14: 

[[1Chr.16.15|15]] Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word \[which\] he commanded to a thousand generations;

15: 

[[1Chr.16.16|16]] \[Even of the covenant\] which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;

16: 

[[1Chr.16.17|17]] And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, \[and\] to Israel \[for\] an everlasting covenant,

17: 

[[1Chr.16.18|18]] Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;

18: 

[[1Chr.16.19|19]] When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.

19: 

[[1Chr.16.20|20]] And \[when\] they went from nation to nation, and from \[one\] kingdom to another people;

20: 

[[1Chr.16.21|21]] He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,

21: 

[[1Chr.16.22|22]] \[Saying\], Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

22:
