*Solomon Anointed King*

[[1Chr.29.21|21]] And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, \[even\] a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, \[and\] a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:

21: 

[[1Chr.29.22|22]] And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed \[him\] unto the LORD \[to be\] the chief governor, and Zadok \[to be\] priest.

22: 

[[1Chr.29.23|23]] Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.

23: 

[[1Chr.29.24|24]] And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.

24: 

[[1Chr.29.25|25]] And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him \[such\] royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.

25:
