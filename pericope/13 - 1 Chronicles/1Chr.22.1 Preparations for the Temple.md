[[1Chr.22|1 Chronicles 22:1 - 1 Chronicles 22:5]]
*Preparations for the Temple*

[[1Chr.22.1|1]] Then David said, This \[is\] the house of the LORD God, and this \[is\] the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.

1: 

[[1Chr.22.2|2]] And David commanded to gather together the strangers that \[were\] in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.

2: 

[[1Chr.22.3|3]] And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;

3: 

[[1Chr.22.4|4]] Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.

4: 

[[1Chr.22.5|5]] And David said, Solomon my son \[is\] young and tender, and the house \[that is\] to be builded for the LORD \[must be\] exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will \[therefore\] now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.
