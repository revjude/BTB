*Saul’s Overthrow and Death*

[[1Chr.10.1|1]] Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.

1: 

[[1Chr.10.2|2]] And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.

2: 

[[1Chr.10.3|3]] And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers.

3: 

[[1Chr.10.4|4]] Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.

4: 

[[1Chr.10.5|5]] And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.

5: 

[[1Chr.10.6|6]] So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.

6:
