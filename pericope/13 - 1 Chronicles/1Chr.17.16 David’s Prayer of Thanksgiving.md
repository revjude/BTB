[[1Chr.17|1 Chronicles 17:16 - 1 Chronicles 17:27]]
*David’s Prayer of Thanksgiving*

[[1Chr.17.16|16]] And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who \[am\] I, O LORD God, and what \[is\] mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?

16: 

[[1Chr.17.17|17]] And \[yet\] this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast \[also\] spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.

17: 

[[1Chr.17.18|18]] What can David \[speak\] more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.

18: 

[[1Chr.17.19|19]] O LORD, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all \[these\] great things.

19: 

[[1Chr.17.20|20]] O LORD, \[there is\] none like thee, neither \[is there any\] God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.

20: 

[[1Chr.17.21|21]] And what one nation in the earth \[is\] like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem \[to be\] his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?

21: 

[[1Chr.17.22|22]] For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.

22: 

[[1Chr.17.23|23]] Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.

23: 

[[1Chr.17.24|24]] Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts \[is\] the God of Israel, \[even\] a God to Israel: and \[let\] the house of David thy servant \[be\] established before thee.

24: 

[[1Chr.17.25|25]] For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found \[in his heart\] to pray before thee.

25: 

[[1Chr.17.26|26]] And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:

26: 

[[1Chr.17.27|27]] Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and \[it shall be\] blessed for ever.

27:
