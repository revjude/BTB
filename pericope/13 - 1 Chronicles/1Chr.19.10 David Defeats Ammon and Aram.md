[[1Chr.19|1 Chronicles 19:10 - 1 Chronicles 19:19]]
*David Defeats Ammon and Aram*

[[1Chr.19.10|10]] Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put \[them\] in array against the Syrians.

10: 

[[1Chr.19.11|11]] And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set \[themselves\] in array against the children of Ammon.

11: 

[[1Chr.19.12|12]] And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.

12: 

[[1Chr.19.13|13]] Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do \[that which is\] good in his sight.

13: 

[[1Chr.19.14|14]] So Joab and the people that \[were\] with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.

14: 

[[1Chr.19.15|15]] And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.

15: 

[[1Chr.19.16|16]] And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that \[were\] beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer \[went\] before them.

16: 

[[1Chr.19.17|17]] And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set \[the battle\] in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.

17: 

[[1Chr.19.18|18]] But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand \[men which fought in\] chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.

18: 

[[1Chr.19.19|19]] And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.

19:
