[[1Chr.23|1 Chronicles 23:24 - 1 Chronicles 23:32]]
*Levite Duties Revised*

[[1Chr.23.24|24]] These \[were\] the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; \[even\] the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.

24: 

[[1Chr.23.25|25]] For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:

25: 

[[1Chr.23.26|26]] And also unto the Levites; they shall no \[more\] carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.

26: 

[[1Chr.23.27|27]] For by the last words of David the Levites \[were\] numbered from twenty years old and above:

27: 

[[1Chr.23.28|28]] Because their office \[was\] to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;

28: 

[[1Chr.23.29|29]] Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for \[that which is baked in\] the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;

29: 

[[1Chr.23.30|30]] And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even;

30: 

[[1Chr.23.31|31]] And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the LORD:

31: 

[[1Chr.23.32|32]] And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy \[place\], and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD.

32:
