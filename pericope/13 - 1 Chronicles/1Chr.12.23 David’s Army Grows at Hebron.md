28: 

[[1Chr.12.29|29]] And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul.

29: 

[[1Chr.12.30|30]] And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers.

31: 

[[1Chr.12.32|32]] And of the children of Issachar, \[which were men\] that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them \[were\] two hundred; and all their brethren \[were\] at their commandment.

32: 

[[1Chr.12.33|33]] Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: \[they were\] not of double heart.

[[1Chr.12.38|38]] All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel \[were\] of one heart to make David king.

38: 

[[1Chr.12.39|39]] And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.

39: 

[[1Chr.12.40|40]] Moreover they that were nigh them, \[even\] unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, \[and\] meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for \[there was\] joy in Israel.
