[[1Chr.17|1 Chronicles 17:1 - 1 Chronicles 17:15]]
*God’s Covenant with David*

[[1Chr.17.1|1]] Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD \[remaineth\] under curtains.

1: 

[[1Chr.17.2|2]] Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that \[is\] in thine heart; for God \[is\] with thee.

2: 

[[1Chr.17.3|3]] And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,

3: 

[[1Chr.17.4|4]] Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:

4: 

[[1Chr.17.5|5]] For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from \[one\] tabernacle \[to another\].

5: 

[[1Chr.17.6|6]] Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?

6: 

[[1Chr.17.7|7]] Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, \[even\] from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:

7: 

[[1Chr.17.8|8]] And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that \[are\] in the earth.

8: 

[[1Chr.17.9|9]] Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,

9: 

[[1Chr.17.10|10]] And since the time that I commanded judges \[to be\] over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house.

10: 

[[1Chr.17.11|11]] And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go \[to be\] with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.

11: 

[[1Chr.17.12|12]] He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.

12: 

[[1Chr.17.13|13]] I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took \[it\] from \[him\] that was before thee:

13: 

[[1Chr.17.14|14]] But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.

14: 

[[1Chr.17.15|15]] According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.

15:
