[[1Chr.16|1 Chronicles 16:23 - 1 Chronicles 16:36]]
*Sing to the LORD, All the Earth*

[[1Chr.16.23|23]] Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation.

23: 

[[1Chr.16.24|24]] Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.

24: 

[[1Chr.16.25|25]] For great \[is\] the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also \[is\] to be feared above all gods.

25: 

[[1Chr.16.26|26]] For all the gods of the people \[are\] idols: but the LORD made the heavens.

26: 

[[1Chr.16.27|27]] Glory and honour \[are\] in his presence; strength and gladness \[are\] in his place.

27: 

[[1Chr.16.28|28]] Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.

28: 

[[1Chr.16.29|29]] Give unto the LORD the glory \[due\] unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.

29: 

[[1Chr.16.30|30]] Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.

30: 

[[1Chr.16.31|31]] Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let \[men\] say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.

31: 

[[1Chr.16.32|32]] Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that \[is\] therein.

32: 

[[1Chr.16.33|33]] Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.

33: 

[[1Chr.16.34|34]] O give thanks unto the LORD; for \[he is\] good; for his mercy \[endureth\] for ever.

34: 

[[1Chr.16.35|35]] And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, \[and\] glory in thy praise.

35: 

[[1Chr.16.36|36]] Blessed \[be\] the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.

36:
