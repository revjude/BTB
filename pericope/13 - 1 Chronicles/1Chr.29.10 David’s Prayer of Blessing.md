[[1Chr.29|1 Chronicles 29:10 - 1 Chronicles 29:20]]
*David’s Prayer of Blessing*

[[1Chr.29.10|10]] Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed \[be\] thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.

10: 

[[1Chr.29.11|11]] Thine, O LORD, \[is\] the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all \[that is\] in the heaven and in the earth \[is thine\]; thine \[is\] the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.

11: 

[[1Chr.29.12|12]] Both riches and honour \[come\] of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand \[is\] power and might; and in thine hand \[it is\] to make great, and to give strength unto all.

12: 

[[1Chr.29.13|13]] Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.

13: 

[[1Chr.29.14|14]] But who \[am\] I, and what \[is\] my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things \[come\] of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.

14: 

[[1Chr.29.15|15]] For we \[are\] strangers before thee, and sojourners, as \[were\] all our fathers: our days on the earth \[are\] as a shadow, and \[there is\] none abiding.

15: 

[[1Chr.29.16|16]] O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name \[cometh\] of thine hand, and \[is\] all thine own.

16: 

[[1Chr.29.17|17]] I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.

17: 

[[1Chr.29.18|18]] O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:

18: 

[[1Chr.29.19|19]] And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all \[these things\], and to build the palace, \[for\] the which I have made provision.

19: 

[[1Chr.29.20|20]] And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.

20:
