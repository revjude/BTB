[[1Chr.28|1 Chronicles 28:11 - 1 Chronicles 28:21]]
*The Plans for the Temple*

[[1Chr.28.11|11]] Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,

11: 

[[1Chr.28.12|12]] And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:

12: 

[[1Chr.28.13|13]] Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD.

13: 

[[1Chr.28.14|14]] \[He gave\] of gold by weight for \[things\] of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; \[silver also\] for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:

14: 

[[1Chr.28.15|15]] Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, \[both\] for the candlestick, and \[also\] for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick.

15: 

[[1Chr.28.16|16]] And by weight \[he gave\] gold for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and \[likewise\] silver for the tables of silver:

16: 

[[1Chr.28.17|17]] Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basons \[he gave gold\] by weight for every bason; and \[likewise silver\] by weight for every bason of silver:

17: 

[[1Chr.28.18|18]] And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out \[their wings\], and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.

18: 

[[1Chr.28.19|19]] All \[this, said David\], the LORD made me understand in writing by \[his\] hand upon me, \[even\] all the works of this pattern.

19: 

[[1Chr.28.20|20]] And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do \[it\]: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, \[even\] my God, \[will be\] with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.

20: 

[[1Chr.28.21|21]] And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, \[even they shall be with thee\] for all the service of the house of God: and \[there shall be\] with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people \[will be\] wholly at thy commandment.

21:
