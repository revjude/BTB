[[1Chr.21|1 Chronicles 21:7 - 1 Chronicles 21:13]]
*Judgment for David’s Sin*

[[1Chr.21.7|7]] And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.

7: 

[[1Chr.21.8|8]] And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.

8: 

[[1Chr.21.9|9]] And the LORD spake unto Gad, David’s seer, saying,

9: 

[[1Chr.21.10|10]] Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three \[things\]: choose thee one of them, that I may do \[it\] unto thee.

10: 

[[1Chr.21.11|11]] So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee

11: 

[[1Chr.21.12|12]] Either three years’ famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh \[thee\]; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.

12: 

[[1Chr.21.13|13]] And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great \[are\] his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.

13:
