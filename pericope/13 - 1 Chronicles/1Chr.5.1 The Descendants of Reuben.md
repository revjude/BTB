[[1Chr.5|1 Chronicles 5:1 - 1 Chronicles 5:10]]
*The Descendants of Reuben*

[[1Chr.5.1|1]] Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he \[was\] the firstborn; but, forasmuch as he defiled his father’s bed, his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.

1: 

[[1Chr.5.2|2]] For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him \[came\] the chief ruler; but the birthright \[was\] Joseph’s:)

2: 

[[1Chr.5.3|3]] The sons, \[I say\], of Reuben the firstborn of Israel \[were\], Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.

3: 

[[1Chr.5.4|4]] The sons of Joel; Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son,

4: 

[[1Chr.5.5|5]] Micah his son, Reaia his son, Baal his son,

5: 

[[1Chr.5.6|6]] Beerah his son, whom Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria carried away \[captive\]: he \[was\] prince of the Reubenites.

6: 

[[1Chr.5.7|7]] And his brethren by their families, when the genealogy of their generations was reckoned, \[were\] the chief, Jeiel, and Zechariah,

7: 

[[1Chr.5.8|8]] And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who dwelt in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baalmeon:

8: 

[[1Chr.5.9|9]] And eastward he inhabited unto the entering in of the wilderness from the river Euphrates: because their cattle were multiplied in the land of Gilead.

9: 

[[1Chr.5.10|10]] And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who fell by their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout all the east \[land\] of Gilead.

10:
