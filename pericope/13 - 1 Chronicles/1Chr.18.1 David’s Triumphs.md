[[1Chr.18|1 Chronicles 18:1 - 1 Chronicles 18:13]]
*David’s Triumphs*

[[1Chr.18.1|1]] Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.

1: 

[[1Chr.18.2|2]] And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David’s servants, \[and\] brought gifts.

2: 

[[1Chr.18.3|3]] And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.

3: 

[[1Chr.18.4|4]] And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot \[horses\], but reserved of them an hundred chariots.

4: 

[[1Chr.18.5|5]] And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.

5: 

[[1Chr.18.6|6]] Then David put \[garrisons\] in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David’s servants, \[and\] brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

6: 

[[1Chr.18.7|7]] And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

7: 

[[1Chr.18.8|8]] Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.

8: 

[[1Chr.18.9|9]] Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;

9: 

[[1Chr.18.10|10]] He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and \[with him\] all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.

10: 

[[1Chr.18.11|11]] Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all \[these\] nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.

11: 

[[1Chr.18.12|12]] Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.

12: 

[[1Chr.18.13|13]] And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David’s servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

13:
