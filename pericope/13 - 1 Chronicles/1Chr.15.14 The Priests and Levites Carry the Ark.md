[[1Chr.15|1 Chronicles 15:14 - 1 Chronicles 15:24]]
*The Priests and Levites Carry the Ark*

[[1Chr.15.14|14]] So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.

14: 

[[1Chr.15.15|15]] And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.

15: 

[[1Chr.15.16|16]] And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren \[to be\] the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.

16: 

[[1Chr.15.17|17]] So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;

17: 

[[1Chr.15.18|18]] And with them their brethren of the second \[degree\], Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.

18: 

[[1Chr.15.19|19]] So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, \[were appointed\] to sound with cymbals of brass;

19: 

[[1Chr.15.20|20]] And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;

20: 

[[1Chr.15.21|21]] And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.

21: 

[[1Chr.15.22|22]] And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, \[was\] for song: he instructed about the song, because he \[was\] skilful.

22: 

[[1Chr.15.23|23]] And Berechiah and Elkanah \[were\] doorkeepers for the ark.

23: 

[[1Chr.15.24|24]] And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah \[were\] doorkeepers for the ark.
