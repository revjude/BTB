[[1Chr.11|1 Chronicles 11:10 - 1 Chronicles 11:47]]
*David’s Mighty Men*

[[1Chr.11.10|10]] These also \[are\] the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, \[and\] with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.

10: 

[[1Chr.11.11|11]] And this \[is\] the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain \[by him\] at one time.

11: 

[[1Chr.11.12|12]] And after him \[was\] Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who \[was one\] of the three mighties.

12: 

[[1Chr.11.13|13]] He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.

13: 

[[1Chr.11.14|14]] And they set themselves in the midst of \[that\] parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved \[them\] by a great deliverance.

14: 

[[1Chr.11.15|15]] Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.

15: 

[[1Chr.11.16|16]] And David \[was\] then in the hold, and the Philistines’ garrison \[was\] then at Bethlehem.

16: 

[[1Chr.11.17|17]] And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that \[is\] at the gate!

17: 

[[1Chr.11.18|18]] And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that \[was\] by the gate, and took \[it\], and brought \[it\] to David: but David would not drink \[of\] it, but poured it out to the LORD,

18: 

[[1Chr.11.19|19]] And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with \[the jeopardy of\] their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.

19: 

[[1Chr.11.20|20]] And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew \[them\], and had a name among the three.

20: 

[[1Chr.11.21|21]] Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the \[first\] three.

21: 

[[1Chr.11.22|22]] Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.

22: 

[[1Chr.11.23|23]] And he slew an Egyptian, a man of \[great\] stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian’s hand \[was\] a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.

23: 

[[1Chr.11.24|24]] These \[things\] did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.

24: 

[[1Chr.11.25|25]] Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the \[first\] three: and David set him over his guard.

25: 

[[1Chr.11.26|26]] Also the valiant men of the armies \[were\], Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
