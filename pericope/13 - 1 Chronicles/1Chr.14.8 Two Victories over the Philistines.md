[[1Chr.14|1 Chronicles 14:8 - 1 Chronicles 14:17]]
*Two Victories over the Philistines*

[[1Chr.14.8|8]] And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard \[of it\], and went out against them.

8: 

[[1Chr.14.9|9]] And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.

9: 

[[1Chr.14.10|10]] And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.

10: 

[[1Chr.14.11|11]] So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim.

11: 

[[1Chr.14.12|12]] And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.

12: 

[[1Chr.14.13|13]] And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.

13: 

[[1Chr.14.14|14]] Therefore David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.

14: 

[[1Chr.14.15|15]] And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, \[that\] then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.

15: 

[[1Chr.14.16|16]] David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.

16: 

[[1Chr.14.17|17]] And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.

17:
