[[1Chr.16|1 Chronicles 16:37 - 1 Chronicles 16:43]]
*Worship before the Ark*

[[1Chr.16.37|37]] So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required:

37: 

[[1Chr.16.38|38]] And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah \[to be\] porters:

38: 

[[1Chr.16.39|39]] And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that \[was\] at Gibeon,

39: 

[[1Chr.16.40|40]] To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and \[to do\] according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel;

40: 

[[1Chr.16.41|41]] And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy \[endureth\] for ever;

41: 

[[1Chr.16.42|42]] And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun \[were\] porters.

42: 

[[1Chr.16.43|43]] And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.

43:
