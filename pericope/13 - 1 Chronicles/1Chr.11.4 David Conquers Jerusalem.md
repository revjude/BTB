[[1Chr.11|1 Chronicles 11:4 - 1 Chronicles 11:9]]
*David Conquers Jerusalem*

[[1Chr.11.4|4]] And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which \[is\] Jebus; where the Jebusites \[were\], the inhabitants of the land.

4: 

[[1Chr.11.5|5]] And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which \[is\] the city of David.

5: 

[[1Chr.11.6|6]] And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.

6: 

[[1Chr.11.7|7]] And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.

7: 

[[1Chr.11.8|8]] And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.

8: 

[[1Chr.11.9|9]] So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts \[was\] with him.

9:
