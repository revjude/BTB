[[1Chr.29|1 Chronicles 29:1 - 1 Chronicles 29:9]]
*Offerings for the Temple*

[[1Chr.29.1|1]] Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, \[is yet\] young and tender, and the work \[is\] great: for the palace \[is\] not for man, but for the LORD God.

1: 

[[1Chr.29.2|2]] Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for \[things to be made\] of gold, and the silver for \[things\] of silver, and the brass for \[things\] of brass, the iron for \[things\] of iron, and wood for \[things\] of wood; onyx stones, and \[stones\] to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.

2: 

[[1Chr.29.3|3]] Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, \[which\] I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,

3: 

[[1Chr.29.4|4]] \[Even\] three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses \[withal\]:

4: 

[[1Chr.29.5|5]] The gold for \[things\] of gold, and the silver for \[things\] of silver, and for all manner of work \[to be made\] by the hands of artificers. And who \[then\] is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD?

5: 

[[1Chr.29.6|6]] Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king’s work, offered willingly,

6: 

[[1Chr.29.7|7]] And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.

7: 

[[1Chr.29.8|8]] And they with whom \[precious\] stones were found gave \[them\] to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.

8: 

[[1Chr.29.9|9]] Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.

9:
