[[1Chr.20|1 Chronicles 20:1 - 1 Chronicles 20:3]]
*The Capture of Rabbah*

[[1Chr.20.1|1]] And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out \[to battle\], Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.

1: 

[[1Chr.20.2|2]] And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and \[there were\] precious stones in it; and it was set upon David’s head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.

2: 

[[1Chr.20.3|3]] And he brought out the people that \[were\] in it, and cut \[them\] with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
