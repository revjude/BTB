[[1Chr.13|1 Chronicles 13:1 - 1 Chronicles 13:7]]
*David Fetches the Ark*

[[1Chr.13.1|1]] And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, \[and\] with every leader.

1: 

[[1Chr.13.2|2]] And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If \[it seem\] good unto you, and \[that it be\] of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, \[that are\] left in all the land of Israel, and with them \[also\] to the priests and Levites \[which are\] in their cities \[and\] suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:

2: 

[[1Chr.13.3|3]] And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul.

3: 

[[1Chr.13.4|4]] And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.

4: 

[[1Chr.13.5|5]] So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.

5: 

[[1Chr.13.6|6]] And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, \[that is\], to Kirjathjearim, which \[belonged\] to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth \[between\] the cherubims, whose name is called \[on it\].

6: 

[[1Chr.13.7|7]] And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.

7:
