[[1Chr.5|1 Chronicles 5:23 - 1 Chronicles 5:26]]
*The Half-Tribe of Manasseh*

[[1Chr.5.23|23]] And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land: they increased from Bashan unto Baalhermon and Senir, and unto mount Hermon.

23: 

[[1Chr.5.24|24]] And these \[were\] the heads of the house of their fathers, even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, \[and\] heads of the house of their fathers.

24: 

[[1Chr.5.25|25]] And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God destroyed before them.

25: 

[[1Chr.5.26|26]] And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this day.

26:
