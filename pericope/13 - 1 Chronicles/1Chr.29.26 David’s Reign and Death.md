*David’s Reign and Death*

[[1Chr.29.26|26]] Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.

[[1Chr.29.27|27]] And the time that he reigned over Israel \[was\] forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three \[years\] reigned he in Jerusalem.

27: 

[[1Chr.29.28|28]] And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.

28: 

[[1Chr.29.29|29]] Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they \[are\] written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,

29: 

[[1Chr.29.30|30]] With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
