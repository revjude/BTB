[[1Chr.13|1 Chronicles 13:8 - 1 Chronicles 13:14]]
*Uzzah Touches the Ark*

[[1Chr.13.8|8]] And David and all Israel played before God with all \[their\] might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

8: 

[[1Chr.13.9|9]] And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.

9: 

[[1Chr.13.10|10]] And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.

10: 

[[1Chr.13.11|11]] And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day.

11: 

[[1Chr.13.12|12]] And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God \[home\] to me?

12: 

[[1Chr.13.13|13]] So David brought not the ark \[home\] to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.

13: 

[[1Chr.13.14|14]] And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.

14:
