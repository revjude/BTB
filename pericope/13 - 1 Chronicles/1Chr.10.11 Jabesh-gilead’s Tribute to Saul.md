[[1Chr.10|1 Chronicles 10:11 - 1 Chronicles 10:14]]
*Jabesh-gilead’s Tribute to Saul*

[[1Chr.10.11|11]] And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,

11: 

[[1Chr.10.12|12]] They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

12: 

[[1Chr.10.13|13]] So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, \[even\] against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking \[counsel\] of \[one that had\] a familiar spirit, to inquire \[of it\];

13: 

[[1Chr.10.14|14]] And inquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.

14:
