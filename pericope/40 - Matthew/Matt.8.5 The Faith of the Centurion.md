[[Matt.8|Matthew 8:5 - Matthew 8:13]]
*The Faith of the Centurion*

[[Matt.8.5|5]] And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,

5: 

[[Matt.8.6|6]] And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.

6: 

[[Matt.8.7|7]] And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.

7: 

[[Matt.8.8|8]] The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.

8: 

[[Matt.8.9|9]] For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this \[man\], Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth \[it\].

9: 

[[Matt.8.10|10]] When Jesus heard \[it\], he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.

10: 

[[Matt.8.11|11]] And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.

11: 

[[Matt.8.12|12]] But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

12: 

[[Matt.8.13|13]] And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, \[so\] be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.

13:
