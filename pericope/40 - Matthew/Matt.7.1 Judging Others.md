[[Matt.7|Matthew 7:1 - Matthew 7:6]]
*Judging Others*

[[Matt.7.1|1]] Judge not, that ye be not judged.

1: 

[[Matt.7.2|2]] For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

2: 

[[Matt.7.3|3]] And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

3: 

[[Matt.7.4|4]] Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam \[is\] in thine own eye?

4: 

[[Matt.7.5|5]] Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.

5: 

[[Matt.7.6|6]] Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.

6:
