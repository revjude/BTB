[[Matt.21|Matthew 21:28 - Matthew 21:32]]
*The Parable of the Two Sons*

[[Matt.21.28|28]] But what think ye? A \[certain\] man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.

28: 

[[Matt.21.29|29]] He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.

29: 

[[Matt.21.30|30]] And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I \[go\], sir: and went not.

30: 

[[Matt.21.31|31]] Whether of them twain did the will of \[his\] father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.

31: 

[[Matt.21.32|32]] For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen \[it\], repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.

32:
