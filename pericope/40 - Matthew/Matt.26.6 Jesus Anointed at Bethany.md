[[Matt.26|Matthew 26:6 - Matthew 26:13]]
*Jesus Anointed at Bethany*

[[Matt.26.6|6]] Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,

6: 

[[Matt.26.7|7]] There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat \[at meat\].

7: 

[[Matt.26.8|8]] But when his disciples saw \[it\], they had indignation, saying, To what purpose \[is\] this waste?

8: 

[[Matt.26.9|9]] For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.

9: 

[[Matt.26.10|10]] When Jesus understood \[it\], he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.

10: 

[[Matt.26.11|11]] For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.

11: 

[[Matt.26.12|12]] For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did \[it\] for my burial.

12: 

[[Matt.26.13|13]] Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, \[there\] shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.

13:
