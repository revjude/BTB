[[Matt.21|Matthew 21:1 - Matthew 21:11]]
*The Triumphal Entry*

[[Matt.21.1|1]] And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,

1: 

[[Matt.21.2|2]] Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose \[them\], and bring \[them\] unto me.

2: 

[[Matt.21.3|3]] And if any \[man\] say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.

3: 

[[Matt.21.4|4]] All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,

4: 

[[Matt.21.5|5]] Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.

5: 

[[Matt.21.6|6]] And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,

6: 

[[Matt.21.7|7]] And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set \[him\] thereon.

7: 

[[Matt.21.8|8]] And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed \[them\] in the way.

8: 

[[Matt.21.9|9]] And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed \[is\] he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.

9: 

[[Matt.21.10|10]] And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?

10: 

[[Matt.21.11|11]] And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.

11:
