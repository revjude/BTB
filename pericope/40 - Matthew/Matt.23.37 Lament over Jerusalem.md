[[Matt.23|Matthew 23:37 - Matthew 23:39]]
*Lament over Jerusalem*

[[Matt.23.37|37]] O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, \[thou\] that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under \[her\] wings, and ye would not!

37: 

[[Matt.23.38|38]] Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.

38: 

[[Matt.23.39|39]] For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed \[is\] he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

39:
