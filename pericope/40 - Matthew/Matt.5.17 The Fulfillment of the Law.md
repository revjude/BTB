[[Matt.5|Matthew 5:17 - Matthew 5:20]]
*The Fulfillment of the Law*

[[Matt.5.17|17]] Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.

17: 

[[Matt.5.18|18]] For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.

18: 

[[Matt.5.19|19]] Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach \[them\], the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

19: 

[[Matt.5.20|20]] For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed \[the righteousness\] of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.

20:
