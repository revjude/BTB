[[Matt.13|Matthew 13:24 - Matthew 13:30]]
*The Parable of the Weeds*

[[Matt.13.24|24]] Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:

24: 

[[Matt.13.25|25]] But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.

25: 

[[Matt.13.26|26]] But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.

26: 

[[Matt.13.27|27]] So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?

27: 

[[Matt.13.28|28]] He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?

28: 

[[Matt.13.29|29]] But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.

29: 

[[Matt.13.30|30]] Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.

30:
