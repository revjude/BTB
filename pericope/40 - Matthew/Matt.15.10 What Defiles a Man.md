[[Matt.15|Matthew 15:10 - Matthew 15:20]]
*What Defiles a Man*

[[Matt.15.10|10]] And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:

10: 

[[Matt.15.11|11]] Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.

11: 

[[Matt.15.12|12]] Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?

12: 

[[Matt.15.13|13]] But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.

13: 

[[Matt.15.14|14]] Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.

14: 

[[Matt.15.15|15]] Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.

15: 

[[Matt.15.16|16]] And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?

16: 

[[Matt.15.17|17]] Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?

17: 

[[Matt.15.18|18]] But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.

18: 

[[Matt.15.19|19]] For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:

19: 

[[Matt.15.20|20]] These are \[the things\] which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.

20:
