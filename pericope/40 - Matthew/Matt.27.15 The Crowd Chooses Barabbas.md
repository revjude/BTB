[[Matt.27|Matthew 27:15 - Matthew 27:23]]
*The Crowd Chooses Barabbas*

[[Matt.27.15|15]] Now at \[that\] feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.

15: 

[[Matt.27.16|16]] And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.

16: 

[[Matt.27.17|17]] Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?

17: 

[[Matt.27.18|18]] For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.

18: 

[[Matt.27.19|19]] When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.

19: 

[[Matt.27.20|20]] But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.

20: 

[[Matt.27.21|21]] The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.

21: 

[[Matt.27.22|22]] Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? \[They\] all say unto him, Let him be crucified.

22: 

[[Matt.27.23|23]] And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.

23:
