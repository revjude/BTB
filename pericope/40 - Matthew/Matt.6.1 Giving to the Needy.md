[[Matt.6|Matthew 6:1 - Matthew 6:4]]
*Giving to the Needy*

[[Matt.6.1|1]] Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.

1: 

[[Matt.6.2|2]] Therefore when thou doest \[thine\] alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

2: 

[[Matt.6.3|3]] But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:

3: 

[[Matt.6.4|4]] That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.

4:
