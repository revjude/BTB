[[Matt.13|Matthew 13:1 - Matthew 13:9]]
*The Parable of the Sower*

[[Matt.13.1|1]] The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.

1: 

[[Matt.13.2|2]] And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.

2: 

[[Matt.13.3|3]] And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;

3: 

[[Matt.13.4|4]] And when he sowed, some \[seeds\] fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:

4: 

[[Matt.13.5|5]] Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:

5: 

[[Matt.13.6|6]] And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.

6: 

[[Matt.13.7|7]] And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:

7: 

[[Matt.13.8|8]] But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.

8: 

[[Matt.13.9|9]] Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

9:
