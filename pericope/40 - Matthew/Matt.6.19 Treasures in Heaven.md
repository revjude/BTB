[[Matt.6|Matthew 6:19 - Matthew 6:21]]
*Treasures in Heaven*

[[Matt.6.19|19]] Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:

19: 

[[Matt.6.20|20]] But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:

20: 

[[Matt.6.21|21]] For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

21:
