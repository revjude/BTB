[[Matt.24|Matthew 24:9 - Matthew 24:14]]
*Witnessing to All Nations*

[[Matt.24.9|9]] Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.

9: 

[[Matt.24.10|10]] And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.

10: 

[[Matt.24.11|11]] And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.

11: 

[[Matt.24.12|12]] And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.

12: 

[[Matt.24.13|13]] But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.

13: 

[[Matt.24.14|14]] And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.

14:
