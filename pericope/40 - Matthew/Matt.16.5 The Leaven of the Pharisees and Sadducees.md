[[Matt.16|Matthew 16:5 - Matthew 16:12]]
*The Leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees*

[[Matt.16.5|5]] And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.

5: 

[[Matt.16.6|6]] Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

6: 

[[Matt.16.7|7]] And they reasoned among themselves, saying, \[It is\] because we have taken no bread.

7: 

[[Matt.16.8|8]] \[Which\] when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?

8: 

[[Matt.16.9|9]] Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?

9: 

[[Matt.16.10|10]] Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?

10: 

[[Matt.16.11|11]] How is it that ye do not understand that I spake \[it\] not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?

11: 

[[Matt.16.12|12]] Then understood they how that he bade \[them\] not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

12:
