[[Matt.10|Matthew 10:5 - Matthew 10:15]]
*The Ministry of the Twelve*

[[Matt.10.5|5]] These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into \[any\] city of the Samaritans enter ye not:

5: 

[[Matt.10.6|6]] But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

6: 

[[Matt.10.7|7]] And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.

7: 

[[Matt.10.8|8]] Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.

8: 

[[Matt.10.9|9]] Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,

9: 

[[Matt.10.10|10]] Nor scrip for \[your\] journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.

10: 

[[Matt.10.11|11]] And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.

11: 

[[Matt.10.12|12]] And when ye come into an house, salute it.

12: 

[[Matt.10.13|13]] And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.

13: 

[[Matt.10.14|14]] And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.

14: 

[[Matt.10.15|15]] Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.

15:
