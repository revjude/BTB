[[Matt.13|Matthew 13:53 - Matthew 13:58]]
*The Rejection at Nazareth*

[[Matt.13.53|53]] And it came to pass, \[that\] when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.

53: 

[[Matt.13.54|54]] And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this \[man\] this wisdom, and \[these\] mighty works?

54: 

[[Matt.13.55|55]] Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?

55: 

[[Matt.13.56|56]] And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this \[man\] all these things?

56: 

[[Matt.13.57|57]] And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.

57: 

[[Matt.13.58|58]] And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.

58:
