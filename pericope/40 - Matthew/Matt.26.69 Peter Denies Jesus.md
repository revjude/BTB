[[Matt.26|Matthew 26:69 - Matthew 26:75]]
*Peter Denies Jesus*

[[Matt.26.69|69]] Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.

69: 

[[Matt.26.70|70]] But he denied before \[them\] all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.

70: 

[[Matt.26.71|71]] And when he was gone out into the porch, another \[maid\] saw him, and said unto them that were there, This \[fellow\] was also with Jesus of Nazareth.

71: 

[[Matt.26.72|72]] And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.

72: 

[[Matt.26.73|73]] And after a while came unto \[him\] they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art \[one\] of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.

73: 

[[Matt.26.74|74]] Then began he to curse and to swear, \[saying\], I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.

74: 

[[Matt.26.75|75]] And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.

75:
