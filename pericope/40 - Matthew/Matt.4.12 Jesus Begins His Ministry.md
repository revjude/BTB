[[Matt.4|Matthew 4:12 - Matthew 4:17]]
*Jesus Begins His Ministry*

[[Matt.4.12|12]] Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;

12: 

[[Matt.4.13|13]] And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:

13: 

[[Matt.4.14|14]] That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,

14: 

[[Matt.4.15|15]] The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, \[by\] the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;

15: 

[[Matt.4.16|16]] The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.

16: 

[[Matt.4.17|17]] From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
