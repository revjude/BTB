[[Matt.6|Matthew 6:16 - Matthew 6:18]]
*Proper Fasting*

[[Matt.6.16|16]] Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

16: 

[[Matt.6.17|17]] But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;

17: 

[[Matt.6.18|18]] That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.

18:
