[[Matt.16|Matthew 16:24 - Matthew 16:28]]
*Take Up Your Cross*

[[Matt.16.24|24]] Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any \[man\] will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

24: 

[[Matt.16.25|25]] For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.

25: 

[[Matt.16.26|26]] For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

26: 

[[Matt.16.27|27]] For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.

27: 

[[Matt.16.28|28]] Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.

28:
