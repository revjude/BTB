[[Matt.12|Matthew 12:9 - Matthew 12:14]]
*Jesus Heals on the Sabbath*

[[Matt.12.9|9]] And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:

9: 

[[Matt.12.10|10]] And, behold, there was a man which had \[his\] hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.

10: 

[[Matt.12.11|11]] And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift \[it\] out?

11: 

[[Matt.12.12|12]] How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.

12: 

[[Matt.12.13|13]] Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched \[it\] forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.

13: 

[[Matt.12.14|14]] Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.

14:
