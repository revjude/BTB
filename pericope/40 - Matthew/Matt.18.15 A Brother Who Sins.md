[[Matt.18|Matthew 18:15 - Matthew 18:18]]
*A Brother Who Sins*

[[Matt.18.15|15]] Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.

15: 

[[Matt.18.16|16]] But if he will not hear \[thee, then\] take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.

16: 

[[Matt.18.17|17]] And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell \[it\] unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.

17: 

[[Matt.18.18|18]] Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

18:
