[[Matt.11|Matthew 11:7 - Matthew 11:19]]
*Jesus Testifies about John*

[[Matt.11.7|7]] And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?

7: 

[[Matt.11.8|8]] But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft \[clothing\] are in kings’ houses.

8: 

[[Matt.11.9|9]] But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.

9: 

[[Matt.11.10|10]] For this is \[he\], of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

10: 

[[Matt.11.11|11]] Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.

11: 

[[Matt.11.12|12]] And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.

12: 

[[Matt.11.13|13]] For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.

13: 

[[Matt.11.14|14]] And if ye will receive \[it\], this is Elias, which was for to come.

14: 

[[Matt.11.15|15]] He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

15: 

[[Matt.11.16|16]] But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,

16: 

[[Matt.11.17|17]] And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.

17: 

[[Matt.11.18|18]] For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.

18: 

[[Matt.11.19|19]] The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.

19:
