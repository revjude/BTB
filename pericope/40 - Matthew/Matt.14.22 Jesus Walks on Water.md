[[Matt.14|Matthew 14:22 - Matthew 14:33]]
*Jesus Walks on Water*

[[Matt.14.22|22]] And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.

22: 

[[Matt.14.23|23]] And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.

23: 

[[Matt.14.24|24]] But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.

24: 

[[Matt.14.25|25]] And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.

25: 

[[Matt.14.26|26]] And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.

26: 

[[Matt.14.27|27]] But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.

27: 

[[Matt.14.28|28]] And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.

28: 

[[Matt.14.29|29]] And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.

29: 

[[Matt.14.30|30]] But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.

30: 

[[Matt.14.31|31]] And immediately Jesus stretched forth \[his\] hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?

31: 

[[Matt.14.32|32]] And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.

32: 

[[Matt.14.33|33]] Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.

33:
