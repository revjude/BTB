[[Matt.26|Matthew 26:36 - Matthew 26:46]]
*Jesus Prays at Gethsemane*

[[Matt.26.36|36]] Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.

36: 

[[Matt.26.37|37]] And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.

37: 

[[Matt.26.38|38]] Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.

38: 

[[Matt.26.39|39]] And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou \[wilt\].

39: 

[[Matt.26.40|40]] And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?

40: 

[[Matt.26.41|41]] Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed \[is\] willing, but the flesh \[is\] weak.

41: 

[[Matt.26.42|42]] He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.

42: 

[[Matt.26.43|43]] And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.

43: 

[[Matt.26.44|44]] And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.

44: 

[[Matt.26.45|45]] Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take \[your\] rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

45: 

[[Matt.26.46|46]] Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.

46:
