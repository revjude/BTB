[[Matt.10|Matthew 10:26 - Matthew 10:31]]
*Fear God Alone*

[[Matt.10.26|26]] Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.

26: 

[[Matt.10.27|27]] What I tell you in darkness, \[that\] speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, \[that\] preach ye upon the housetops.

27: 

[[Matt.10.28|28]] And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

28: 

[[Matt.10.29|29]] Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.

29: 

[[Matt.10.30|30]] But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

30: 

[[Matt.10.31|31]] Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.

31:
