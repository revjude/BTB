[[Matt.6|Matthew 6:25 - Matthew 6:34]]
*Do Not Worry*

[[Matt.6.25|25]] Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?

25: 

[[Matt.6.26|26]] Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?

26: 

[[Matt.6.27|27]] Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?

27: 

[[Matt.6.28|28]] And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:

28: 

[[Matt.6.29|29]] And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

29: 

[[Matt.6.30|30]] Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, \[shall he\] not much more \[clothe\] you, O ye of little faith?

30: 

[[Matt.6.31|31]] Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?

31: 

[[Matt.6.32|32]] (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.

32: 

[[Matt.6.33|33]] But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.

33: 

[[Matt.6.34|34]] Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day \[is\] the evil thereof.

34:
