[[Matt.15|Matthew 15:1 - Matthew 15:9]]
*The Tradition of the Elders*

[[Matt.15.1|1]] Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,

1: 

[[Matt.15.2|2]] Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.

2: 

[[Matt.15.3|3]] But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?

3: 

[[Matt.15.4|4]] For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.

4: 

[[Matt.15.5|5]] But ye say, Whosoever shall say to \[his\] father or \[his\] mother, \[It is\] a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;

5: 

[[Matt.15.6|6]] And honour not his father or his mother, \[he shall be free\]. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.

6: 

[[Matt.15.7|7]] \[Ye\] hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,

7: 

[[Matt.15.8|8]] This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with \[their\] lips; but their heart is far from me.

8: 

[[Matt.15.9|9]] But in vain they do worship me, teaching \[for\] doctrines the commandments of men.

9:
