[[Matt.26|Matthew 26:20 - Matthew 26:30]]
*The Last Supper*

[[Matt.26.20|20]] Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.

20: 

[[Matt.26.21|21]] And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.

21: 

[[Matt.26.22|22]] And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?

22: 

[[Matt.26.23|23]] And he answered and said, He that dippeth \[his\] hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.

23: 

[[Matt.26.24|24]] The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.

24: 

[[Matt.26.25|25]] Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.

25: 

[[Matt.26.26|26]] And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed \[it\], and brake \[it\], and gave \[it\] to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.

26: 

[[Matt.26.27|27]] And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave \[it\] to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;

27: 

[[Matt.26.28|28]] For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.

28: 

[[Matt.26.29|29]] But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.

29: 

[[Matt.26.30|30]] And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.

30:
