[[Matt.18|Matthew 18:6 - Matthew 18:9]]
*Temptations and Trespasses*

[[Matt.18.6|6]] But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and \[that\] he were drowned in the depth of the sea.

6: 

[[Matt.18.7|7]] Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!

7: 

[[Matt.18.8|8]] Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast \[them\] from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.

8: 

[[Matt.18.9|9]] And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast \[it\] from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.

9:
