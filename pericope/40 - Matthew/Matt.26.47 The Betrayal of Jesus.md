[[Matt.26|Matthew 26:47 - Matthew 26:56]]
*The Betrayal of Jesus*

[[Matt.26.47|47]] And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.

47: 

[[Matt.26.48|48]] Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.

48: 

[[Matt.26.49|49]] And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.

49: 

[[Matt.26.50|50]] And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.

50: 

[[Matt.26.51|51]] And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out \[his\] hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s, and smote off his ear.

51: 

[[Matt.26.52|52]] Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.

52: 

[[Matt.26.53|53]] Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?

53: 

[[Matt.26.54|54]] But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?

54: 

[[Matt.26.55|55]] In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.

55: 

[[Matt.26.56|56]] But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
