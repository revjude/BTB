[[Matt.12|Matthew 12:33 - Matthew 12:37]]
*Good and Bad Fruit*

[[Matt.12.33|33]] Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by \[his\] fruit.

33: 

[[Matt.12.34|34]] O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.

34: 

[[Matt.12.35|35]] A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.

35: 

[[Matt.12.36|36]] But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.

36: 

[[Matt.12.37|37]] For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.

37:
