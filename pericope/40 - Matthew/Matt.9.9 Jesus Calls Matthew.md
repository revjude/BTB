[[Matt.9|Matthew 9:9 - Matthew 9:13]]
*Jesus Calls Matthew*

[[Matt.9.9|9]] And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.

9: 

[[Matt.9.10|10]] And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.

10: 

[[Matt.9.11|11]] And when the Pharisees saw \[it\], they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?

11: 

[[Matt.9.12|12]] But when Jesus heard \[that\], he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.

12: 

[[Matt.9.13|13]] But go ye and learn what \[that\] meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

13:
