[[Matt.5|Matthew 5:21 - Matthew 5:26]]
*Anger and Reconciliation*

[[Matt.5.21|21]] Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:

21: 

[[Matt.5.22|22]] But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.

22: 

[[Matt.5.23|23]] Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;

23: 

[[Matt.5.24|24]] Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.

24: 

[[Matt.5.25|25]] Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.

25: 

[[Matt.5.26|26]] Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.

26:
