[[Matt.5|Matthew 5:38 - Matthew 5:48]]
*Love Your Enemies*

[[Matt.5.38|38]] Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:

38: 

[[Matt.5.39|39]] But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.

39: 

[[Matt.5.40|40]] And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have \[thy\] cloke also.

40: 

[[Matt.5.41|41]] And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.

41: 

[[Matt.5.42|42]] Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.

42: 

[[Matt.5.43|43]] Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.

43: 

[[Matt.5.44|44]] But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;

44: 

[[Matt.5.45|45]] That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.

45: 

[[Matt.5.46|46]] For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?

46: 

[[Matt.5.47|47]] And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more \[than others\]? do not even the publicans so?

47: 

[[Matt.5.48|48]] Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.

48:
