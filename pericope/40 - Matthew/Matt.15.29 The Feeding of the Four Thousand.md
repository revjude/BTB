[[Matt.15|Matthew 15:29 - Matthew 15:39]]
*The Feeding of the Four Thousand*

[[Matt.15.29|29]] And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.

29: 

[[Matt.15.30|30]] And great multitudes came unto him, having with them \[those that were\] lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed them:

30: 

[[Matt.15.31|31]] Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.

31: 

[[Matt.15.32|32]] Then Jesus called his disciples \[unto him\], and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.

32: 

[[Matt.15.33|33]] And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?

33: 

[[Matt.15.34|34]] And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.

34: 

[[Matt.15.35|35]] And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.

35: 

[[Matt.15.36|36]] And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake \[them\], and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.

36: 

[[Matt.15.37|37]] And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken \[meat\] that was left seven baskets full.

37: 

[[Matt.15.38|38]] And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.

38: 

[[Matt.15.39|39]] And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.

39:
