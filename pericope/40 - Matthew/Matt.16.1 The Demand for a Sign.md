[[Matt.16|Matthew 16:1 - Matthew 16:4]]
*The Demand for a Sign*

[[Matt.16.1|1]] The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.

1: 

[[Matt.16.2|2]] He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, \[It will be\] fair weather: for the sky is red.

2: 

[[Matt.16.3|3]] And in the morning, \[It will be\] foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O \[ye\] hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not \[discern\] the signs of the times?

3: 

[[Matt.16.4|4]] A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.

4:
