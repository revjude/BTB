[[Matt.25|Matthew 25:14 - Matthew 25:30]]
*The Parable of the Talents*

[[Matt.25.14|14]] For \[the kingdom of heaven is\] as a man travelling into a far country, \[who\] called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.

14: 

[[Matt.25.15|15]] And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.

15: 

[[Matt.25.16|16]] Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made \[them\] other five talents.

16: 

[[Matt.25.17|17]] And likewise he that \[had received\] two, he also gained other two.

17: 

[[Matt.25.18|18]] But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.

18: 

[[Matt.25.19|19]] After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.

19: 

[[Matt.25.20|20]] And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.

20: 

[[Matt.25.21|21]] His lord said unto him, Well done, \[thou\] good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

21: 

[[Matt.25.22|22]] He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.

22: 

[[Matt.25.23|23]] His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

23: 

[[Matt.25.24|24]] Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:

24: 

[[Matt.25.25|25]] And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, \[there\] thou hast \[that is\] thine.

25: 

[[Matt.25.26|26]] His lord answered and said unto him, \[Thou\] wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:

26: 

[[Matt.25.27|27]] Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and \[then\] at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.

27: 

[[Matt.25.28|28]] Take therefore the talent from him, and give \[it\] unto him which hath ten talents.

28: 

[[Matt.25.29|29]] For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.

29: 

[[Matt.25.30|30]] And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

30:
