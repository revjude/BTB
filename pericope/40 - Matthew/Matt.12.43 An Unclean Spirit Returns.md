[[Matt.12|Matthew 12:43 - Matthew 12:45]]
*An Unclean Spirit Returns*

[[Matt.12.43|43]] When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.

43: 

[[Matt.12.44|44]] Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth \[it\] empty, swept, and garnished.

44: 

[[Matt.12.45|45]] Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last \[state\] of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.

45:
