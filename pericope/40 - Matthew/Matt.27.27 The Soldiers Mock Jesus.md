*The Soldiers Mock Jesus*

[[Matt.27.27|27]] Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band \[of soldiers\].

27: 

[[Matt.27.28|28]] And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.

28: 

[[Matt.27.29|29]] And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put \[it\] upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!

29: 

[[Matt.27.30|30]] And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.

30: 

[[Matt.27.31|31]] And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify \[him\].
