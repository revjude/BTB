[[Matt.20|Matthew 20:1 - Matthew 20:16]]
*The Parable of the Workers*

[[Matt.20.1|1]] For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man \[that is\] an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.

1: 

[[Matt.20.2|2]] And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.

2: 

[[Matt.20.3|3]] And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,

3: 

[[Matt.20.4|4]] And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.

4: 

[[Matt.20.5|5]] Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.

5: 

[[Matt.20.6|6]] And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?

6: 

[[Matt.20.7|7]] They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, \[that\] shall ye receive.

7: 

[[Matt.20.8|8]] So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them \[their\] hire, beginning from the last unto the first.

8: 

[[Matt.20.9|9]] And when they came that \[were hired\] about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.

9: 

[[Matt.20.10|10]] But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.

10: 

[[Matt.20.11|11]] And when they had received \[it\], they murmured against the goodman of the house,

11: 

[[Matt.20.12|12]] Saying, These last have wrought \[but\] one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.

12: 

[[Matt.20.13|13]] But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?

13: 

[[Matt.20.14|14]] Take \[that\] thine \[is\], and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.

14: 

[[Matt.20.15|15]] Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?

15: 

[[Matt.20.16|16]] So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.

16:
