[[Matt.14|Matthew 14:1 - Matthew 14:12]]
*The Beheading of John*

[[Matt.14.1|1]] At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,

1: 

[[Matt.14.2|2]] And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.

2: 

[[Matt.14.3|3]] For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put \[him\] in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife.

3: 

[[Matt.14.4|4]] For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.

4: 

[[Matt.14.5|5]] And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.

5: 

[[Matt.14.6|6]] But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.

6: 

[[Matt.14.7|7]] Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.

7: 

[[Matt.14.8|8]] And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist’s head in a charger.

8: 

[[Matt.14.9|9]] And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath’s sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded \[it\] to be given \[her\].

9: 

[[Matt.14.10|10]] And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.

10: 

[[Matt.14.11|11]] And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought \[it\] to her mother.

11: 

[[Matt.14.12|12]] And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.
