*The Greatest Commandment*

[[Matt.22.34|34]] But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.

34: 

[[Matt.22.35|35]] Then one of them, \[which was\] a lawyer, asked \[him a question\], tempting him, and saying,

35: 

[[Matt.22.36|36]] Master, which \[is\] the great commandment in the law?

36: 

[[Matt.22.37|37]] Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.

37: 

[[Matt.22.38|38]] This is the first and great commandment.

38: 

[[Matt.22.39|39]] And the second \[is\] like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

39: 

[[Matt.22.40|40]] On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
