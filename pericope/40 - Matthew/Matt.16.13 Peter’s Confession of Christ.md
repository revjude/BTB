[[Matt.16|Matthew 16:13 - Matthew 16:20]]
*Peter’s Confession of Christ*

[[Matt.16.13|13]] When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?

13: 

[[Matt.16.14|14]] And they said, Some \[say that thou art\] John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.

14: 

[[Matt.16.15|15]] He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?

15: 

[[Matt.16.16|16]] And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

16: 

[[Matt.16.17|17]] And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed \[it\] unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.

17: 

[[Matt.16.18|18]] And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

18: 

[[Matt.16.19|19]] And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

19: 

[[Matt.16.20|20]] Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.

20:
