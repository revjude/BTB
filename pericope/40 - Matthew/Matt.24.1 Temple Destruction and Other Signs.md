[[Matt.24|Matthew 24:1 - Matthew 24:8]]
*Temple Destruction and Other Signs*

[[Matt.24.1|1]] And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to \[him\] for to shew him the buildings of the temple.

1: 

[[Matt.24.2|2]] And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.

2: 

[[Matt.24.3|3]] And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what \[shall be\] the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?

3: 

[[Matt.24.4|4]] And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.

4: 

[[Matt.24.5|5]] For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.

5: 

[[Matt.24.6|6]] And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all \[these things\] must come to pass, but the end is not yet.

6: 

[[Matt.24.7|7]] For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.

7: 

[[Matt.24.8|8]] All these \[are\] the beginning of sorrows.

8:
