*The Blind Men by the Road*

[[Matt.20.29|29]] And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.

29: 

[[Matt.20.30|30]] And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, \[thou\] Son of David.

30: 

[[Matt.20.31|31]] And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, \[thou\] Son of David.

31: 

[[Matt.20.32|32]] And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?

32: 

[[Matt.20.33|33]] They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.

33: 

[[Matt.20.34|34]] So Jesus had compassion \[on them\], and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.

34:
