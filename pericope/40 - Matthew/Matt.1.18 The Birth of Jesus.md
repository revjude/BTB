[[Matt.1|Matthew 1:18 - Matthew 1:25]]
*The Birth of Jesus*

[[Matt.1.18|18]] Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.

18: 

[[Matt.1.19|19]] Then Joseph her husband, being a just \[man\], and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.

19: 

[[Matt.1.20|20]] But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.

20: 

[[Matt.1.21|21]] And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.

21: 

[[Matt.1.22|22]] Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,

22: 

[[Matt.1.23|23]] Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.

23: 

[[Matt.1.24|24]] Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:

24: 

[[Matt.1.25|25]] And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.

25:
