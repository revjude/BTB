[[Matt.4|Matthew 4:1 - Matthew 4:11]]
*The Temptation of Jesus*

[[Matt.4.1|1]] Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.

1: 

[[Matt.4.2|2]] And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.

2: 

[[Matt.4.3|3]] And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.

3: 

[[Matt.4.4|4]] But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.

4: 

[[Matt.4.5|5]] Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,

5: 

[[Matt.4.6|6]] And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in \[their\] hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.

6: 

[[Matt.4.7|7]] Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.

7: 

[[Matt.4.8|8]] Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;

8: 

[[Matt.4.9|9]] And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.

9: 

[[Matt.4.10|10]] Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.

10: 

[[Matt.4.11|11]] Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.

11:
