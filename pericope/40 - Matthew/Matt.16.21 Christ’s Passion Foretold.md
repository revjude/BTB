[[Matt.16|Matthew 16:21 - Matthew 16:23]]
*Christ’s Passion Foretold*

[[Matt.16.21|21]] From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.

21: 

[[Matt.16.22|22]] Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.

22: 

[[Matt.16.23|23]] But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.

23:
