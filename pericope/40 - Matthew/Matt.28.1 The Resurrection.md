[[Matt.28|Matthew 28:1 - Matthew 28:10]]
*The Resurrection*

[[Matt.28.1|1]] In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first \[day\] of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.

1: 

[[Matt.28.2|2]] And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.

2: 

[[Matt.28.3|3]] His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:

3: 

[[Matt.28.4|4]] And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead \[men\].

4: 

[[Matt.28.5|5]] And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.

5: 

[[Matt.28.6|6]] He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.

6: 

[[Matt.28.7|7]] And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.

7: 

[[Matt.28.8|8]] And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.

8: 

[[Matt.28.9|9]] And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.

9: 

[[Matt.28.10|10]] Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.

10:
