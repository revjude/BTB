[[Matt.22|Matthew 22:23 - Matthew 22:33]]
*The Sadducees and the Resurrection*

[[Matt.22.23|23]] The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,

23: 

[[Matt.22.24|24]] Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

24: 

[[Matt.22.25|25]] Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:

25: 

[[Matt.22.26|26]] Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.

26: 

[[Matt.22.27|27]] And last of all the woman died also.

27: 

[[Matt.22.28|28]] Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.

28: 

[[Matt.22.29|29]] Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.

29: 

[[Matt.22.30|30]] For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.

30: 

[[Matt.22.31|31]] But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,

31: 

[[Matt.22.32|32]] I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

32: 

[[Matt.22.33|33]] And when the multitude heard \[this\], they were astonished at his doctrine.

33:
