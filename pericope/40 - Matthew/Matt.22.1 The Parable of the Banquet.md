[[Matt.22|Matthew 22:1 - Matthew 22:14]]
*The Parable of the Banquet*

[[Matt.22.1|1]] And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,

1: 

[[Matt.22.2|2]] The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,

2: 

[[Matt.22.3|3]] And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.

3: 

[[Matt.22.4|4]] Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and \[my\] fatlings \[are\] killed, and all things \[are\] ready: come unto the marriage.

4: 

[[Matt.22.5|5]] But they made light of \[it\], and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:

5: 

[[Matt.22.6|6]] And the remnant took his servants, and entreated \[them\] spitefully, and slew \[them\].

6: 

[[Matt.22.7|7]] But when the king heard \[thereof\], he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.

7: 

[[Matt.22.8|8]] Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.

8: 

[[Matt.22.9|9]] Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.

9: 

[[Matt.22.10|10]] So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.

10: 

[[Matt.22.11|11]] And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:

11: 

[[Matt.22.12|12]] And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.

12: 

[[Matt.22.13|13]] Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast \[him\] into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

13: 

[[Matt.22.14|14]] For many are called, but few \[are\] chosen.

14:
