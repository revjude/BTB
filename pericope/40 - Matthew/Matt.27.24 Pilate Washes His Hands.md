[[Matt.27|Matthew 27:24 - Matthew 27:26]]
*Pilate Washes His Hands*

[[Matt.27.24|24]] When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but \[that\] rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed \[his\] hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye \[to it\].

24: 

[[Matt.27.25|25]] Then answered all the people, and said, His blood \[be\] on us, and on our children.

25: 

[[Matt.27.26|26]] Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered \[him\] to be crucified.

26:
