[[Matt.22|Matthew 22:41 - Matthew 22:46]]
*Whose Son Is the Christ？*

[[Matt.22.41|41]] While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,

41: 

[[Matt.22.42|42]] Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, \[The Son\] of David.

42: 

[[Matt.22.43|43]] He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,

43: 

[[Matt.22.44|44]] The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?

44: 

[[Matt.22.45|45]] If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?

45: 

[[Matt.22.46|46]] And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any \[man\] from that day forth ask him any more \[questions\].

46:
