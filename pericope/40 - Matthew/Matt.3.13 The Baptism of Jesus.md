[[Matt.3|Matthew 3:13 - Matthew 3:17]]
*The Baptism of Jesus*

[[Matt.3.13|13]] Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.

13: 

[[Matt.3.14|14]] But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?

14: 

[[Matt.3.15|15]] And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer \[it to be so\] now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.

15: 

[[Matt.3.16|16]] And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:

16: 

[[Matt.3.17|17]] And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

17:
