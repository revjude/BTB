[[Matt.6|Matthew 6:22 - Matthew 6:24]]
*The Lamp of the Body*

[[Matt.6.22|22]] The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.

22: 

[[Matt.6.23|23]] But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great \[is\] that darkness!

23: 

[[Matt.6.24|24]] No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

24:
