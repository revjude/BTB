[[Matt.8|Matthew 8:23 - Matthew 8:27]]
*Jesus Calms the Storm*

[[Matt.8.23|23]] And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.

23: 

[[Matt.8.24|24]] And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.

24: 

[[Matt.8.25|25]] And his disciples came to \[him\], and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.

25: 

[[Matt.8.26|26]] And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.

26: 

[[Matt.8.27|27]] But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!
