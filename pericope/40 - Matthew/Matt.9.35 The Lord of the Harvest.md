[[Matt.9|Matthew 9:35 - Matthew 9:38]]
*The Lord of the Harvest*

[[Matt.9.35|35]] And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.

35: 

[[Matt.9.36|36]] But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.

36: 

[[Matt.9.37|37]] Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly \[is\] plenteous, but the labourers \[are\] few;

37: 

[[Matt.9.38|38]] Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.

38:
