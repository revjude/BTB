[[Matt.26|Matthew 26:57 - Matthew 26:68]]
*Jesus before the Sanhedrin*

[[Matt.26.57|57]] And they that had laid hold on Jesus led \[him\] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.

57: 

[[Matt.26.58|58]] But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.

58: 

[[Matt.26.59|59]] Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;

59: 

[[Matt.26.60|60]] But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, \[yet\] found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,

60: 

[[Matt.26.61|61]] And said, This \[fellow\] said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.

61: 

[[Matt.26.62|62]] And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what \[is it which\] these witness against thee?

62: 

[[Matt.26.63|63]] But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.

63: 

[[Matt.26.64|64]] Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.

64: 

[[Matt.26.65|65]] Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.

65: 

[[Matt.26.66|66]] What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.

66: 

[[Matt.26.67|67]] Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote \[him\] with the palms of their hands,

67: 

[[Matt.26.68|68]] Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?

68:
