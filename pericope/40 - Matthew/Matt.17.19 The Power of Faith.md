[[Matt.17|Matthew 17:19 - Matthew 17:20]]
*The Power of Faith*

[[Matt.17.19|19]] Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?

19: 

[[Matt.17.20|20]] And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.

20:
