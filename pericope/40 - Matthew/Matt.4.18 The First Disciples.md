[[Matt.4|Matthew 4:18 - Matthew 4:22]]
*The First Disciples*

[[Matt.4.18|18]] And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.

18: 

[[Matt.4.19|19]] And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.

[[Matt.4.20|20]] And they straightway left \[their\] nets, and followed him.

20: 

[[Matt.4.21|21]] And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James \[the son\] of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.

21: 

[[Matt.4.22|22]] And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.
