[[Matt.24|Matthew 24:36 - Matthew 24:51]]
*Readiness at Any Hour*

[[Matt.24.36|36]] But of that day and hour knoweth no \[man\], no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.

36: 

[[Matt.24.37|37]] But as the days of Noe \[were\], so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

37: 

[[Matt.24.38|38]] For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,

38: 

[[Matt.24.39|39]] And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

39: 

[[Matt.24.40|40]] Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.

40: 

[[Matt.24.41|41]] Two \[women shall be\] grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.

41: 

[[Matt.24.42|42]] Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.

42: 

[[Matt.24.43|43]] But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.

43: 

[[Matt.24.44|44]] Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.

44: 

[[Matt.24.45|45]] Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?

45: 

[[Matt.24.46|46]] Blessed \[is\] that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.

46: 

[[Matt.24.47|47]] Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.

47: 

[[Matt.24.48|48]] But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;

48: 

[[Matt.24.49|49]] And shall begin to smite \[his\] fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;

49: 

[[Matt.24.50|50]] The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for \[him\], and in an hour that he is not aware of,

50: 

[[Matt.24.51|51]] And shall cut him asunder, and appoint \[him\] his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

51:
