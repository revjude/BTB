[[Matt.5|Matthew 5:27 - Matthew 5:30]]
*Adultery*

[[Matt.5.27|27]] Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:

27: 

[[Matt.5.28|28]] But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.

28: 

[[Matt.5.29|29]] And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast \[it\] from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not \[that\] thy whole body should be cast into hell.

29: 

[[Matt.5.30|30]] And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast \[it\] from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not \[that\] thy whole body should be cast into hell.

30:
