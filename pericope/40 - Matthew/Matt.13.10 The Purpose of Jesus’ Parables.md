[[Matt.13|Matthew 13:10 - Matthew 13:17]]
*The Purpose of Jesus’ Parables*

[[Matt.13.10|10]] And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?

10: 

[[Matt.13.11|11]] He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.

11: 

[[Matt.13.12|12]] For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.

12: 

[[Matt.13.13|13]] Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.

13: 

[[Matt.13.14|14]] And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:

14: 

[[Matt.13.15|15]] For this people’s heart is waxed gross, and \[their\] ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with \[their\] eyes, and hear with \[their\] ears, and should understand with \[their\] heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.

15: 

[[Matt.13.16|16]] But blessed \[are\] your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.

16: 

[[Matt.13.17|17]] For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous \[men\] have desired to see \[those things\] which ye see, and have not seen \[them\]; and to hear \[those things\] which ye hear, and have not heard \[them\].

17:
