[[Matt.13|Matthew 13:36 - Matthew 13:43]]
*The Parable of the Weeds Explained*

[[Matt.13.36|36]] Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.

36: 

[[Matt.13.37|37]] He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;

37: 

[[Matt.13.38|38]] The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked \[one\];

38: 

[[Matt.13.39|39]] The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.

39: 

[[Matt.13.40|40]] As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.

40: 

[[Matt.13.41|41]] The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;

41: 

[[Matt.13.42|42]] And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

42: 

[[Matt.13.43|43]] Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

43:
