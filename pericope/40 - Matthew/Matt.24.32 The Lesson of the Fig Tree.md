[[Matt.24|Matthew 24:32 - Matthew 24:35]]
*The Lesson of the Fig Tree*

[[Matt.24.32|32]] Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer \[is\] nigh:

[[Matt.24.33|33]] So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, \[even\] at the doors.

34: 

[[Matt.24.35|35]] Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.

35:
