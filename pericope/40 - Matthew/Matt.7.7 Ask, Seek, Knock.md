[[Matt.7|Matthew 7:7 - Matthew 7:12]]
*Ask, Seek, Knock*

[[Matt.7.7|7]] Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:

7: 

[[Matt.7.8|8]] For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

8: 

[[Matt.7.9|9]] Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?

9: 

[[Matt.7.10|10]] Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

10: 

[[Matt.7.11|11]] If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?

11: 

[[Matt.7.12|12]] Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.

12:
