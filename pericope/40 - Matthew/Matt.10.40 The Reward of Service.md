*The Reward of Service*

[[Matt.10.40|40]] He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.

[[Matt.10.41|41]] He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.

[[Matt.10.42|42]] And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold \[water\] only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.
