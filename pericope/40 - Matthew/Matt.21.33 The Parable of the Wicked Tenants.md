[[Matt.21|Matthew 21:33 - Matthew 21:46]]
*The Parable of the Wicked Tenants*

[[Matt.21.33|33]] Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:

33: 

[[Matt.21.34|34]] And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.

34: 

[[Matt.21.35|35]] And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.

35: 

[[Matt.21.36|36]] Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.

36: 

[[Matt.21.37|37]] But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.

37: 

[[Matt.21.38|38]] But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.

38: 

[[Matt.21.39|39]] And they caught him, and cast \[him\] out of the vineyard, and slew \[him\].

39: 

[[Matt.21.40|40]] When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?

40: 

[[Matt.21.41|41]] They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out \[his\] vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.

41: 

[[Matt.21.42|42]] Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?

42: 

[[Matt.21.43|43]] Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.

43: 

[[Matt.21.44|44]] And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

44: 

[[Matt.21.45|45]] And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.

45: 

[[Matt.21.46|46]] But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.

46:
