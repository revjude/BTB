[[Matt.7|Matthew 7:24 - Matthew 7:27]]
*The House on the Rock*

[[Matt.7.24|24]] Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:

24: 

[[Matt.7.25|25]] And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.

25: 

[[Matt.7.26|26]] And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:

26: 

[[Matt.7.27|27]] And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.

27:
