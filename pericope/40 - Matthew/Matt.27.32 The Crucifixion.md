[[Matt.27|Matthew 27:32 - Matthew 27:44]]
*The Crucifixion*

[[Matt.27.32|32]] And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.

32: 

[[Matt.27.33|33]] And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,

33: 

[[Matt.27.34|34]] They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted \[thereof\], he would not drink.

34: 

[[Matt.27.35|35]] And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.

35: 

[[Matt.27.36|36]] And sitting down they watched him there;

36: 

[[Matt.27.37|37]] And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

37: 

[[Matt.27.38|38]] Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.

38: 

[[Matt.27.39|39]] And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,

39: 

[[Matt.27.40|40]] And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest \[it\] in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.

40: 

[[Matt.27.41|41]] Likewise also the chief priests mocking \[him\], with the scribes and elders, said,

41: 

[[Matt.27.42|42]] He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.

42: 

[[Matt.27.43|43]] He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.

43: 

[[Matt.27.44|44]] The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.

44:
