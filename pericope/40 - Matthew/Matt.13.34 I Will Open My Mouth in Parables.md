[[Matt.13|Matthew 13:34 - Matthew 13:35]]
*I Will Open My Mouth in Parables*

[[Matt.13.34|34]] All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:

[[Matt.13.35|35]] That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.

35:
