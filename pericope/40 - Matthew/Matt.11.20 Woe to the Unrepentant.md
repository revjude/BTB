[[Matt.11|Matthew 11:20 - Matthew 11:24]]
*Woe to the Unrepentant*

[[Matt.11.20|20]] Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:

20: 

[[Matt.11.21|21]] Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

21: 

[[Matt.11.22|22]] But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.

22: 

[[Matt.11.23|23]] And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.

23: 

[[Matt.11.24|24]] But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.

24:
