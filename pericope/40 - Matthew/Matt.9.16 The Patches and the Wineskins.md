[[Matt.9|Matthew 9:16 - Matthew 9:17]]
*The Patches and the Wineskins*

[[Matt.9.16|16]] No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.

16: 

[[Matt.9.17|17]] Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.

17:
