[[Matt.10|Matthew 10:34 - Matthew 10:39]]
*Not Peace but a Sword*

[[Matt.10.34|34]] Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.

34: 

[[Matt.10.35|35]] For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.

35: 

[[Matt.10.36|36]] And a man’s foes \[shall be\] they of his own household.

36: 

[[Matt.10.37|37]] He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.

37: 

[[Matt.10.38|38]] And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.

38: 

[[Matt.10.39|39]] He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.

39:
