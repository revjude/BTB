[[Matt.15|Matthew 15:21 - Matthew 15:28]]
*The Faith of the Canaanite Woman*

[[Matt.15.21|21]] Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.

21: 

[[Matt.15.22|22]] And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, \[thou\] Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.

22: 

[[Matt.15.23|23]] But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.

23: 

[[Matt.15.24|24]] But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

24: 

[[Matt.15.25|25]] Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.

25: 

[[Matt.15.26|26]] But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast \[it\] to dogs.

26: 

[[Matt.15.27|27]] And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.

27: 

[[Matt.15.28|28]] Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great \[is\] thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.

28:
