[[Matt.24|Matthew 24:26 - Matthew 24:31]]
*The Return of the Son of Man*

[[Matt.24.26|26]] Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, \[he is\] in the secret chambers; believe \[it\] not.

26: 

[[Matt.24.27|27]] For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

27: 

[[Matt.24.28|28]] For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.

28: 

[[Matt.24.29|29]] Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:

29: 

[[Matt.24.30|30]] And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.

30: 

[[Matt.24.31|31]] And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.

31:
