[[Matt.19|Matthew 19:1 - Matthew 19:12]]
*Teachings about Divorce*

[[Matt.19.1|1]] And it came to pass, \[that\] when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;

1: 

[[Matt.19.2|2]] And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.

2: 

[[Matt.19.3|3]] The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?

3: 

[[Matt.19.4|4]] And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made \[them\] at the beginning made them male and female,

4: 

[[Matt.19.5|5]] And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?

5: 

[[Matt.19.6|6]] Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.

6: 

[[Matt.19.7|7]] They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?

7: 

[[Matt.19.8|8]] He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.

8: 

[[Matt.19.9|9]] And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except \[it be\] for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.

9: 

[[Matt.19.10|10]] His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with \[his\] wife, it is not good to marry.

10: 

[[Matt.19.11|11]] But he said unto them, All \[men\] cannot receive this saying, save \[they\] to whom it is given.

11: 

[[Matt.19.12|12]] For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from \[their\] mother’s womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive \[it\], let him receive \[it\].

12:
