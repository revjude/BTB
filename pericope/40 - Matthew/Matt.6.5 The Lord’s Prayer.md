[[Matt.6|Matthew 6:5 - Matthew 6:15]]
*The Lord’s Prayer*

[[Matt.6.5|5]] And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites \[are\]: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

5: 

[[Matt.6.6|6]] But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.

6: 

[[Matt.6.7|7]] But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen \[do\]: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.

7: 

[[Matt.6.8|8]] Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.

8: 

[[Matt.6.9|9]] After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.

9: 

[[Matt.6.10|10]] Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as \[it is\] in heaven.

10: 

[[Matt.6.11|11]] Give us this day our daily bread.

11: 

[[Matt.6.12|12]] And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.

12: 

[[Matt.6.13|13]] And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.

13: 

[[Matt.6.14|14]] For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:

14: 

[[Matt.6.15|15]] But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

15:
