[[Matt.9|Matthew 9:27 - Matthew 9:34]]
*Jesus Heals the Blind and Mute*

[[Matt.9.27|27]] And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, \[Thou\] Son of David, have mercy on us.

27: 

[[Matt.9.28|28]] And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.

28: 

[[Matt.9.29|29]] Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.

29: 

[[Matt.9.30|30]] And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See \[that\] no man know \[it\].

30: 

[[Matt.9.31|31]] But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.

31: 

[[Matt.9.32|32]] As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.

32: 

[[Matt.9.33|33]] And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.

33: 

[[Matt.9.34|34]] But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.
