[[Matt.27|Matthew 27:45 - Matthew 27:56]]
*The Death of Jesus*

[[Matt.27.45|45]] Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.

45: 

[[Matt.27.46|46]] And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

46: 

[[Matt.27.47|47]] Some of them that stood there, when they heard \[that\], said, This \[man\] calleth for Elias.

47: 

[[Matt.27.48|48]] And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled \[it\] with vinegar, and put \[it\] on a reed, and gave him to drink.

48: 

[[Matt.27.49|49]] The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.

49: 

[[Matt.27.50|50]] Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.

50: 

[[Matt.27.51|51]] And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;

51: 

[[Matt.27.52|52]] And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,

52: 

[[Matt.27.53|53]] And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.

53: 

[[Matt.27.54|54]] Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.

54: 

[[Matt.27.55|55]] And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:

55: 

[[Matt.27.56|56]] Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children.
