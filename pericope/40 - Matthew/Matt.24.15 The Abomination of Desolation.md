[[Matt.24|Matthew 24:15 - Matthew 24:25]]
*The Abomination of Desolation*

[[Matt.24.15|15]] When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)

15: 

[[Matt.24.16|16]] Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:

16: 

[[Matt.24.17|17]] Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:

17: 

[[Matt.24.18|18]] Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.

18: 

[[Matt.24.19|19]] And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!

19: 

[[Matt.24.20|20]] But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:

20: 

[[Matt.24.21|21]] For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.

21: 

[[Matt.24.22|22]] And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.

22: 

[[Matt.24.23|23]] Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here \[is\] Christ, or there; believe \[it\] not.

23: 

[[Matt.24.24|24]] For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if \[it were\] possible, they shall deceive the very elect.

24: 

[[Matt.24.25|25]] Behold, I have told you before.

25:
