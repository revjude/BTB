[[Matt.12|Matthew 12:38 - Matthew 12:42]]
*The Sign of Jonah*

[[Matt.12.38|38]] Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.

38: 

[[Matt.12.39|39]] But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:

39: 

[[Matt.12.40|40]] For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

40: 

[[Matt.12.41|41]] The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas \[is\] here.

41: 

[[Matt.12.42|42]] The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon \[is\] here.

42:
