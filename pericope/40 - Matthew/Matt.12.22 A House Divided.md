[[Matt.12|Matthew 12:22 - Matthew 12:30]]
*A House Divided*

[[Matt.12.22|22]] Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.

22: 

[[Matt.12.23|23]] And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?

23: 

[[Matt.12.24|24]] But when the Pharisees heard \[it\], they said, This \[fellow\] doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.

24: 

[[Matt.12.25|25]] And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:

25: 

[[Matt.12.26|26]] And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?

26: 

[[Matt.12.27|27]] And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast \[them\] out? therefore they shall be your judges.

27: 

[[Matt.12.28|28]] But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.

28: 

[[Matt.12.29|29]] Or else how can one enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.

29: 

[[Matt.12.30|30]] He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.

30:
