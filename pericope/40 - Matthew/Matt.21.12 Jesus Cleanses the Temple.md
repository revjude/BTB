[[Matt.21.12|12]] And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,

12: 

[[Matt.21.13|13]] And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.

13: 

[[Matt.21.14|14]] And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.

14: 

[[Matt.21.15|15]] And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; they were sore displeased,

15: 

[[Matt.21.16|16]] And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?

16: 

[[Matt.21.17|17]] And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.
