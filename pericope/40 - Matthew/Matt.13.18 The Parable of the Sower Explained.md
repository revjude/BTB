[[Matt.13|Matthew 13:18 - Matthew 13:23]]
*The Parable of the Sower Explained*

[[Matt.13.18|18]] Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.

18: 

[[Matt.13.19|19]] When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth \[it\] not, then cometh the wicked \[one\], and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.

19: 

[[Matt.13.20|20]] But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;

20: 

[[Matt.13.21|21]] Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.

21: 

[[Matt.13.22|22]] He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.

22: 

[[Matt.13.23|23]] But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth \[it\]; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.

23:
