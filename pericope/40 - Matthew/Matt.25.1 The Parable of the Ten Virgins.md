[[Matt.25|Matthew 25:1 - Matthew 25:13]]
*The Parable of the Ten Virgins*

[[Matt.25.1|1]] Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.

1: 

[[Matt.25.2|2]] And five of them were wise, and five \[were\] foolish.

2: 

[[Matt.25.3|3]] They that \[were\] foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:

3: 

[[Matt.25.4|4]] But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.

4: 

[[Matt.25.5|5]] While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.

5: 

[[Matt.25.6|6]] And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.

6: 

[[Matt.25.7|7]] Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.

7: 

[[Matt.25.8|8]] And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.

8: 

[[Matt.25.9|9]] But the wise answered, saying, \[Not so\]; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.

9: 

[[Matt.25.10|10]] And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.

10: 

[[Matt.25.11|11]] Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.

11: 

[[Matt.25.12|12]] But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.

12: 

[[Matt.25.13|13]] Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.

13:
