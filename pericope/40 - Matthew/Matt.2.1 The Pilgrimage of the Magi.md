[[Matt.2|Matthew 2:1 - Matthew 2:12]]
*The Pilgrimage of the Magi*

[[Matt.2.1|1]] Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,

1: 

[[Matt.2.2|2]] Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.

2: 

[[Matt.2.3|3]] When Herod the king had heard \[these things\], he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.

3: 

[[Matt.2.4|4]] And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.

4: 

[[Matt.2.5|5]] And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,

5: 

[[Matt.2.6|6]] And thou Bethlehem, \[in\] the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.

6: 

[[Matt.2.7|7]] Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.

7: 

[[Matt.2.8|8]] And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found \[him\], bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.

8: 

[[Matt.2.9|9]] When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.

9: 

[[Matt.2.10|10]] When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.

10: 

[[Matt.2.11|11]] And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.

11: 

[[Matt.2.12|12]] And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.

12:
