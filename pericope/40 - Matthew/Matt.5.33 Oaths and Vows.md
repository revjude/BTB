[[Matt.5|Matthew 5:33 - Matthew 5:37]]
*Oaths and Vows*

[[Matt.5.33|33]] Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:

33: 

[[Matt.5.34|34]] But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne:

34: 

[[Matt.5.35|35]] Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.

35: 

[[Matt.5.36|36]] Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.

36: 

[[Matt.5.37|37]] But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.

37:
