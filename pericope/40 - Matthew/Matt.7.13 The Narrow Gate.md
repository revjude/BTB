[[Matt.7|Matthew 7:13 - Matthew 7:14]]
*The Narrow Gate*

[[Matt.7.13|13]] Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide \[is\] the gate, and broad \[is\] the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:

13: 

[[Matt.7.14|14]] Because strait \[is\] the gate, and narrow \[is\] the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.

14:
