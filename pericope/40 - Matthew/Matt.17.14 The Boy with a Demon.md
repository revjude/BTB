[[Matt.17|Matthew 17:14 - Matthew 17:18]]
*The Boy with a Demon*

[[Matt.17.14|14]] And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a \[certain\] man, kneeling down to him, and saying,

14: 

[[Matt.17.15|15]] Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.

15: 

[[Matt.17.16|16]] And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.

16: 

[[Matt.17.17|17]] Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.

17: 

[[Matt.17.18|18]] And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.

18:
