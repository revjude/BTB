[[Matt.12|Matthew 12:15 - Matthew 12:21]]
*God’s Chosen Servant*

[[Matt.12.15|15]] But when Jesus knew \[it\], he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;

15: 

[[Matt.12.16|16]] And charged them that they should not make him known:

16: 

[[Matt.12.17|17]] That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,

17: 

[[Matt.12.18|18]] Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.

18: 

[[Matt.12.19|19]] He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.

19: 

[[Matt.12.20|20]] A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.

20: 

[[Matt.12.21|21]] And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.

21:
