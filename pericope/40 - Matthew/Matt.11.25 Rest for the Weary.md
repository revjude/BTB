[[Matt.11|Matthew 11:25 - Matthew 11:30]]
*Rest for the Weary*

[[Matt.11.25|25]] At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.

25: 

[[Matt.11.26|26]] Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.

26: 

[[Matt.11.27|27]] All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and \[he\] to whomsoever the Son will reveal \[him\].

27: 

[[Matt.11.28|28]] Come unto me, all \[ye\] that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.

28: 

[[Matt.11.29|29]] Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.

29: 

[[Matt.11.30|30]] For my yoke \[is\] easy, and my burden is light.

30:
