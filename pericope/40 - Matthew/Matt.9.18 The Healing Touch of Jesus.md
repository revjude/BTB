[[Matt.9|Matthew 9:18 - Matthew 9:26]]
*The Healing Touch of Jesus*

[[Matt.9.18|18]] While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.

18: 

[[Matt.9.19|19]] And Jesus arose, and followed him, and \[so did\] his disciples.

19: 

[[Matt.9.20|20]] And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind \[him\], and touched the hem of his garment:

20: 

[[Matt.9.21|21]] For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.

21: 

[[Matt.9.22|22]] But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.

22: 

[[Matt.9.23|23]] And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,

23: 

[[Matt.9.24|24]] He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.

24: 

[[Matt.9.25|25]] But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.

25: 

[[Matt.9.26|26]] And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.

26:
