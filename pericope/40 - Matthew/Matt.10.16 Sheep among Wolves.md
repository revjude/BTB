[[Matt.10|Matthew 10:16 - Matthew 10:25]]
*Sheep among Wolves*

[[Matt.10.16|16]] Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.

16: 

[[Matt.10.17|17]] But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;

17: 

[[Matt.10.18|18]] And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.

18: 

[[Matt.10.19|19]] But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.

19: 

[[Matt.10.20|20]] For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.

20: 

[[Matt.10.21|21]] And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against \[their\] parents, and cause them to be put to death.

21: 

[[Matt.10.22|22]] And ye shall be hated of all \[men\] for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.

22: 

[[Matt.10.23|23]] But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.

23: 

[[Matt.10.24|24]] The disciple is not above \[his\] master, nor the servant above his lord.

24: 

[[Matt.10.25|25]] It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more \[shall they call\] them of his household?

25:
