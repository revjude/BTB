[[Matt.13|Matthew 13:47 - Matthew 13:52]]
*The Parable of the Net*

[[Matt.13.47|47]] Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:

47: 

[[Matt.13.48|48]] Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.

48: 

[[Matt.13.49|49]] So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,

49: 

[[Matt.13.50|50]] And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

50: 

[[Matt.13.51|51]] Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.

51: 

[[Matt.13.52|52]] Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe \[which is\] instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man \[that is\] an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure \[things\] new and old.

52:
