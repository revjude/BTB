[[Matt.25|Matthew 25:31 - Matthew 25:46]]
*The Sheep and the Goats*

[[Matt.25.31|31]] When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:

31: 

[[Matt.25.32|32]] And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth \[his\] sheep from the goats:

32: 

[[Matt.25.33|33]] And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.

33: 

[[Matt.25.34|34]] Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:

34: 

[[Matt.25.35|35]] For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:

35: 

[[Matt.25.36|36]] Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.

36: 

[[Matt.25.37|37]] Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed \[thee\]? or thirsty, and gave \[thee\] drink?

37: 

[[Matt.25.38|38]] When saw we thee a stranger, and took \[thee\] in? or naked, and clothed \[thee\]?

38: 

[[Matt.25.39|39]] Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?

39: 

[[Matt.25.40|40]] And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done \[it\] unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done \[it\] unto me.

40: 

[[Matt.25.41|41]] Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:

41: 

[[Matt.25.42|42]] For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:

42: 

[[Matt.25.43|43]] I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.

43: 

[[Matt.25.44|44]] Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?

44: 

[[Matt.25.45|45]] Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did \[it\] not to one of the least of these, ye did \[it\] not to me.

45: 

[[Matt.25.46|46]] And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
