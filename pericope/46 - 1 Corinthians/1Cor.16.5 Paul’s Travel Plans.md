[[1Cor.16|1 Corinthians 16:5 - 1 Corinthians 16:9]]
*Paul’s Travel Plans*

[[1Cor.16.5|5]] Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.

5: 

[[1Cor.16.6|6]] And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.

6: 

[[1Cor.16.7|7]] For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.

7: 

[[1Cor.16.8|8]] But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.

8: 

[[1Cor.16.9|9]] For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and \[there are\] many adversaries.

9:
