[[1Cor.9|1 Corinthians 9:19 - 1 Corinthians 9:23]]
*Paul the Servant to All*

[[1Cor.9.19|19]] For though I be free from all \[men\], yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.

19: 

[[1Cor.9.20|20]] And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;

20: 

[[1Cor.9.21|21]] To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.

21: 

[[1Cor.9.22|22]] To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all \[men\], that I might by all means save some.

22: 

[[1Cor.9.23|23]] And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with \[you\].

23:
