[[1Cor.16|1 Corinthians 16:13 - 1 Corinthians 16:18]]
*Concluding Exhortations*

[[1Cor.16.13|13]] Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.

13: 

[[1Cor.16.14|14]] Let all your things be done with charity.

14: 

[[1Cor.16.15|15]] I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and \[that\] they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)

15: 

[[1Cor.16.16|16]] That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with \[us\], and laboureth.

16: 

[[1Cor.16.17|17]] I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.

17: 

[[1Cor.16.18|18]] For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.

18:
