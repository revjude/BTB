[[1Cor.9|1 Corinthians 9:1 - 1 Corinthians 9:18]]
*The Rights of an Apostle*

[[1Cor.9.1|1]] Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?

1: 

[[1Cor.9.2|2]] If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.

2: 

[[1Cor.9.3|3]] Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,

3: 

[[1Cor.9.4|4]] Have we not power to eat and to drink?

4: 

[[1Cor.9.5|5]] Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and \[as\] the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?

5: 

[[1Cor.9.6|6]] Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?

6: 

[[1Cor.9.7|7]] Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?

7: 

[[1Cor.9.8|8]] Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?

8: 

[[1Cor.9.9|9]] For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?

9: 

[[1Cor.9.10|10]] Or saith he \[it\] altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, \[this\] is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.

10: 

[[1Cor.9.11|11]] If we have sown unto you spiritual things, \[is it\] a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?

11: 

[[1Cor.9.12|12]] If others be partakers of \[this\] power over you, \[are\] not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.

12: 

[[1Cor.9.13|13]] Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live \[of the things\] of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?

13: 

[[1Cor.9.14|14]] Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.

14: 

[[1Cor.9.15|15]] But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for \[it were\] better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.

15: 

[[1Cor.9.16|16]] For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!

16: 

[[1Cor.9.17|17]] For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation \[of the gospel\] is committed unto me.

17: 

[[1Cor.9.18|18]] What is my reward then? \[Verily\] that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.

18:
