[[1Cor.2|1 Corinthians 2:1 - 1 Corinthians 2:5]]
*Paul’s Message by the Spirit’s Power*

[[1Cor.2.1|1]] And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.

1: 

[[1Cor.2.2|2]] For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.

2: 

[[1Cor.2.3|3]] And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.

3: 

[[1Cor.2.4|4]] And my speech and my preaching \[was\] not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:

4: 

[[1Cor.2.5|5]] That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.

5:
