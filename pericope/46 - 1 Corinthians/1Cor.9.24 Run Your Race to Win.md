[[1Cor.9|1 Corinthians 9:24 - 1 Corinthians 9:27]]
*Run Your Race to Win*

[[1Cor.9.24|24]] Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.

24: 

[[1Cor.9.25|25]] And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they \[do it\] to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.

25: 

[[1Cor.9.26|26]] I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:

26: 

[[1Cor.9.27|27]] But I keep under my body, and bring \[it\] into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.

27:
