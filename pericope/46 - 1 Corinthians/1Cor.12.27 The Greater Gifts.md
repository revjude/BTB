[[1Cor.12|1 Corinthians 12:27 - 1 Corinthians 12:31]]
*The Greater Gifts*

[[1Cor.12.27|27]] Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.

27: 

[[1Cor.12.28|28]] And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.

28: 

[[1Cor.12.29|29]] \[Are\] all apostles? \[are\] all prophets? \[are\] all teachers? \[are\] all workers of miracles?

29: 

[[1Cor.12.30|30]] Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?

30: 

[[1Cor.12.31|31]] But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.

31:
