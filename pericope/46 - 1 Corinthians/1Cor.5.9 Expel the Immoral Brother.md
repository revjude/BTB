[[1Cor.5|1 Corinthians 5:9 - 1 Corinthians 5:13]]
*Expel the Immoral Brother*

[[1Cor.5.9|9]] I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:

9: 

[[1Cor.5.10|10]] Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.

10: 

[[1Cor.5.11|11]] But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.

11: 

[[1Cor.5.12|12]] For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?

12: 

[[1Cor.5.13|13]] But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.

13:
