[[1Cor.1|1 Corinthians 1:18 - 1 Corinthians 1:25]]
*The Message of the Cross*

[[1Cor.1.18|18]] For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.

18: 

[[1Cor.1.19|19]] For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.

19: 

[[1Cor.1.20|20]] Where \[is\] the wise? where \[is\] the scribe? where \[is\] the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?

20: 

[[1Cor.1.21|21]] For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.

21: 

[[1Cor.1.22|22]] For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:

22: 

[[1Cor.1.23|23]] But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;

23: 

[[1Cor.1.24|24]] But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.

24: 

[[1Cor.1.25|25]] Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.

25:
