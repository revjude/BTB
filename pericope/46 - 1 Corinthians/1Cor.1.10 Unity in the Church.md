[[1Cor.1|1 Corinthians 1:10 - 1 Corinthians 1:17]]
*Unity in the Church*

[[1Cor.1.10|10]] Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and \[that\] there be no divisions among you; but \[that\] ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.

10: 

[[1Cor.1.11|11]] For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them \[which are of the house\] of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.

11: 

[[1Cor.1.12|12]] Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.

12: 

[[1Cor.1.13|13]] Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?

13: 

[[1Cor.1.14|14]] I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;

14: 

[[1Cor.1.15|15]] Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.

15: 

[[1Cor.1.16|16]] And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.

16: 

[[1Cor.1.17|17]] For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.

17:
