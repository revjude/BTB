[[1Cor.16|1 Corinthians 16:10 - 1 Corinthians 16:12]]
*Timothy and Apollos*

[[1Cor.16.10|10]] Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also \[do\].

10: 

[[1Cor.16.11|11]] Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.

11: 

[[1Cor.16.12|12]] As touching \[our\] brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.

12:
