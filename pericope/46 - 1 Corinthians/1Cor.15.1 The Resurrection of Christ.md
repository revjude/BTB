[[1Cor.15|1 Corinthians 15:1 - 1 Corinthians 15:11]]
*The Resurrection of Christ*

[[1Cor.15.1|1]] Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;

1: 

[[1Cor.15.2|2]] By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.

2: 

[[1Cor.15.3|3]] For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;

3: 

[[1Cor.15.4|4]] And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

4: 

[[1Cor.15.5|5]] And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:

5: 

[[1Cor.15.6|6]] After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.

6: 

[[1Cor.15.7|7]] After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.

7: 

[[1Cor.15.8|8]] And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.

8: 

[[1Cor.15.9|9]] For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

9: 

[[1Cor.15.10|10]] But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which \[was bestowed\] upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.

10: 

[[1Cor.15.11|11]] Therefore whether \[it were\] I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.

11:
