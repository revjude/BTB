[[1Cor.4|1 Corinthians 4:14 - 1 Corinthians 4:21]]
*Paul’s Fatherly Warning*

[[1Cor.4.14|14]] I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn \[you\].

14: 

[[1Cor.4.15|15]] For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet \[have ye\] not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.

15: 

[[1Cor.4.16|16]] Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.

16: 

[[1Cor.4.17|17]] For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.

17: 

[[1Cor.4.18|18]] Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.

18: 

[[1Cor.4.19|19]] But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.

19: 

[[1Cor.4.20|20]] For the kingdom of God \[is\] not in word, but in power.

20: 

[[1Cor.4.21|21]] What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and \[in\] the spirit of meekness?

21:
