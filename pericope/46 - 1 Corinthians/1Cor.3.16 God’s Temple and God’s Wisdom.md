[[1Cor.3|1 Corinthians 3:16 - 1 Corinthians 3:23]]
*God’s Temple and God’s Wisdom*

[[1Cor.3.16|16]] Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and \[that\] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?

16: 

[[1Cor.3.17|17]] If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which \[temple\] ye are.

17: 

[[1Cor.3.18|18]] Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.

18: 

[[1Cor.3.19|19]] For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.

19: 

[[1Cor.3.20|20]] And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.

20: 

[[1Cor.3.21|21]] Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;

21: 

[[1Cor.3.22|22]] Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;

22: 

[[1Cor.3.23|23]] And ye are Christ’s; and Christ \[is\] God’s.

23:
