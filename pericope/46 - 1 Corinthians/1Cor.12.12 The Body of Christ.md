[[1Cor.12|1 Corinthians 12:12 - 1 Corinthians 12:26]]
*The Body of Christ*

[[1Cor.12.12|12]] For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also \[is\] Christ.

12: 

[[1Cor.12.13|13]] For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether \[we be\] Jews or Gentiles, whether \[we be\] bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.

13: 

[[1Cor.12.14|14]] For the body is not one member, but many.

14: 

[[1Cor.12.15|15]] If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?

15: 

[[1Cor.12.16|16]] And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?

16: 

[[1Cor.12.17|17]] If the whole body \[were\] an eye, where \[were\] the hearing? If the whole \[were\] hearing, where \[were\] the smelling?

17: 

[[1Cor.12.18|18]] But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.

18: 

[[1Cor.12.19|19]] And if they were all one member, where \[were\] the body?

19: 

[[1Cor.12.20|20]] But now \[are they\] many members, yet but one body.

20: 

[[1Cor.12.21|21]] And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.

21: 

[[1Cor.12.22|22]] Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:

22: 

[[1Cor.12.23|23]] And those \[members\] of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely \[parts\] have more abundant comeliness.

23: 

[[1Cor.12.24|24]] For our comely \[parts\] have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that \[part\] which lacked:

24: 

[[1Cor.12.25|25]] That there should be no schism in the body; but \[that\] the members should have the same care one for another.

25: 

[[1Cor.12.26|26]] And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.

26:
