[[1Cor.3|1 Corinthians 3:10 - 1 Corinthians 3:15]]
*Christ Our Foundation*

[[1Cor.3.10|10]] According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.

10: 

[[1Cor.3.11|11]] For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.

11: 

[[1Cor.3.12|12]] Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;

12: 

[[1Cor.3.13|13]] Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.

13: 

[[1Cor.3.14|14]] If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.

14: 

[[1Cor.3.15|15]] If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.

15:
