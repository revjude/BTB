[[1Cor.14|1 Corinthians 14:26 - 1 Corinthians 14:40]]
*Orderly Worship*

[[1Cor.14.26|26]] How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.

26: 

[[1Cor.14.27|27]] If any man speak in an \[unknown\] tongue, \[let it be\] by two, or at the most \[by\] three, and \[that\] by course; and let one interpret.

27: 

[[1Cor.14.28|28]] But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.

28: 

[[1Cor.14.29|29]] Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.

29: 

[[1Cor.14.30|30]] If \[any thing\] be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.

30: 

[[1Cor.14.31|31]] For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.

31: 

[[1Cor.14.32|32]] And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.

32: 

[[1Cor.14.33|33]] For God is not \[the author\] of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.

33: 

[[1Cor.14.34|34]] Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but \[they are commanded\] to be under obedience, as also saith the law.

34: 

[[1Cor.14.35|35]] And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.

35: 

[[1Cor.14.36|36]] What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?

36: 

[[1Cor.14.37|37]] If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.

37: 

[[1Cor.14.38|38]] But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.

38: 

[[1Cor.14.39|39]] Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.

39: 

[[1Cor.14.40|40]] Let all things be done decently and in order.

40:
