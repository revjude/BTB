[[1Cor.6|1 Corinthians 6:1 - 1 Corinthians 6:8]]
*Lawsuits among Believers*

[[1Cor.6.1|1]] Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?

1: 

[[1Cor.6.2|2]] Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?

2: 

[[1Cor.6.3|3]] Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?

3: 

[[1Cor.6.4|4]] If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.

4: 

[[1Cor.6.5|5]] I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?

5: 

[[1Cor.6.6|6]] But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.

6: 

[[1Cor.6.7|7]] Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather \[suffer yourselves to\] be defrauded?

7: 

[[1Cor.6.8|8]] Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that \[your\] brethren.

8:
