[[1Cor.10|1 Corinthians 10:23 - 1 Corinthians 10:33]]
*All to God’s Glory*

[[1Cor.10.23|23]] All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.

23: 

[[1Cor.10.24|24]] Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s \[wealth\].

24: 

[[1Cor.10.25|25]] Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, \[that\] eat, asking no question for conscience sake:

25: 

[[1Cor.10.26|26]] For the earth \[is\] the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.

26: 

[[1Cor.10.27|27]] If any of them that believe not bid you \[to a feast\], and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.

27: 

[[1Cor.10.28|28]] But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth \[is\] the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof:

28: 

[[1Cor.10.29|29]] Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another \[man’s\] conscience?

29: 

[[1Cor.10.30|30]] For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?

30: 

[[1Cor.10.31|31]] Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.

31: 

[[1Cor.10.32|32]] Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:

32: 

[[1Cor.10.33|33]] Even as I please all \[men\] in all \[things\], not seeking mine own profit, but the \[profit\] of many, that they may be saved.

33:
