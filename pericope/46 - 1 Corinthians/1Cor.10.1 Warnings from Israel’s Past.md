[[1Cor.10|1 Corinthians 10:1 - 1 Corinthians 10:13]]
*Warnings from Israel’s Past*

[[1Cor.10.1|1]] Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;

1: 

[[1Cor.10.2|2]] And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;

2: 

[[1Cor.10.3|3]] And did all eat the same spiritual meat;

3: 

[[1Cor.10.4|4]] And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.

4: 

[[1Cor.10.5|5]] But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.

5: 

[[1Cor.10.6|6]] Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.

6: 

[[1Cor.10.7|7]] Neither be ye idolaters, as \[were\] some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.

7: 

[[1Cor.10.8|8]] Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.

8: 

[[1Cor.10.9|9]] Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.

9: 

[[1Cor.10.10|10]] Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.

10: 

[[1Cor.10.11|11]] Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.

11: 

[[1Cor.10.12|12]] Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.

12: 

[[1Cor.10.13|13]] There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God \[is\] faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear \[it\].

13:
