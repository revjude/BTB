[[1Cor.1|1 Corinthians 1:26 - 1 Corinthians 1:31]]
*Wisdom from God*

[[1Cor.1.26|26]] For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, \[are called\]:

26: 

[[1Cor.1.27|27]] But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;

27: 

[[1Cor.1.28|28]] And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, \[yea\], and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:

28: 

[[1Cor.1.29|29]] That no flesh should glory in his presence.

29: 

[[1Cor.1.30|30]] But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:

30: 

[[1Cor.1.31|31]] That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.

31:
