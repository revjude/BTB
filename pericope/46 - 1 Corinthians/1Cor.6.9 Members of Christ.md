[[1Cor.6|1 Corinthians 6:9 - 1 Corinthians 6:17]]
*Members of Christ*

[[1Cor.6.9|9]] Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,

9: 

[[1Cor.6.10|10]] Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

10: 

[[1Cor.6.11|11]] And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.

11: 

[[1Cor.6.12|12]] All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.

12: 

[[1Cor.6.13|13]] Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body \[is\] not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.

13: 

[[1Cor.6.14|14]] And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.

14: 

[[1Cor.6.15|15]] Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make \[them\] the members of an harlot? God forbid.

15: 

[[1Cor.6.16|16]] What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.

16: 

[[1Cor.6.17|17]] But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.

17:
