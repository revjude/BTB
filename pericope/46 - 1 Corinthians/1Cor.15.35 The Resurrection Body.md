[[1Cor.15|1 Corinthians 15:35 - 1 Corinthians 15:49]]
*The Resurrection Body*

[[1Cor.15.35|35]] But some \[man\] will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?

35: 

[[1Cor.15.36|36]] \[Thou\] fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:

36: 

[[1Cor.15.37|37]] And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other \[grain\]:

37: 

[[1Cor.15.38|38]] But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.

38: 

[[1Cor.15.39|39]] All flesh \[is\] not the same flesh: but \[there is\] one \[kind of\] flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, \[and\] another of birds.

39: 

[[1Cor.15.40|40]] \[There are\] also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial \[is\] one, and the \[glory\] of the terrestrial \[is\] another.

40: 

[[1Cor.15.41|41]] \[There is\] one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for \[one\] star differeth from \[another\] star in glory.

41: 

[[1Cor.15.42|42]] So also \[is\] the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:

42: 

[[1Cor.15.43|43]] It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:

43: 

[[1Cor.15.44|44]] It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.

44: 

[[1Cor.15.45|45]] And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam \[was made\] a quickening spirit.

45: 

[[1Cor.15.46|46]] Howbeit that \[was\] not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.

46: 

[[1Cor.15.47|47]] The first man \[is\] of the earth, earthy: the second man \[is\] the Lord from heaven.

47: 

[[1Cor.15.48|48]] As \[is\] the earthy, such \[are\] they also that are earthy: and as \[is\] the heavenly, such \[are\] they also that are heavenly.

48: 

[[1Cor.15.49|49]] And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
