[[1Cor.1|1 Corinthians 1:4 - 1 Corinthians 1:9]]
*Thanksgiving*

[[1Cor.1.4|4]] I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;

4: 

[[1Cor.1.5|5]] That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and \[in\] all knowledge;

5: 

[[1Cor.1.6|6]] Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:

6: 

[[1Cor.1.7|7]] So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:

7: 

[[1Cor.1.8|8]] Who shall also confirm you unto the end, \[that ye may be\] blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

8: 

[[1Cor.1.9|9]] God \[is\] faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.

9:
