[[1Cor.11|1 Corinthians 11:1 - 1 Corinthians 11:16]]
*Roles in Worship*

[[1Cor.11.1|1]] Be ye followers of me, even as I also \[am\] of Christ.

1: 

[[1Cor.11.2|2]] Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered \[them\] to you.

2: 

[[1Cor.11.3|3]] But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman \[is\] the man; and the head of Christ \[is\] God.

3: 

[[1Cor.11.4|4]] Every man praying or prophesying, having \[his\] head covered, dishonoureth his head.

4: 

[[1Cor.11.5|5]] But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with \[her\] head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.

5: 

[[1Cor.11.6|6]] For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.

6: 

[[1Cor.11.7|7]] For a man indeed ought not to cover \[his\] head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.

7: 

[[1Cor.11.8|8]] For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.

8: 

[[1Cor.11.9|9]] Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.

9: 

[[1Cor.11.10|10]] For this cause ought the woman to have power on \[her\] head because of the angels.

10: 

[[1Cor.11.11|11]] Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.

11: 

[[1Cor.11.12|12]] For as the woman \[is\] of the man, even so \[is\] the man also by the woman; but all things of God.

12: 

[[1Cor.11.13|13]] Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?

13: 

[[1Cor.11.14|14]] Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?

14: 

[[1Cor.11.15|15]] But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for \[her\] hair is given her for a covering.

15: 

[[1Cor.11.16|16]] But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.

16:
