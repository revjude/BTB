[[1Cor.11|1 Corinthians 11:17 - 1 Corinthians 11:34]]
*Sharing in the Lord’s Supper*

[[1Cor.11.17|17]] Now in this that I declare \[unto you\] I praise \[you\] not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.

17: 

[[1Cor.11.18|18]] For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.

18: 

[[1Cor.11.19|19]] For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.

19: 

[[1Cor.11.20|20]] When ye come together therefore into one place, \[this\] is not to eat the Lord’s supper.

20: 

[[1Cor.11.21|21]] For in eating every one taketh before \[other\] his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.

21: 

[[1Cor.11.22|22]] What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise \[you\] not.

22: 

[[1Cor.11.23|23]] For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the \[same\] night in which he was betrayed took bread:

23: 

[[1Cor.11.24|24]] And when he had given thanks, he brake \[it\], and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.

24: 

[[1Cor.11.25|25]] After the same manner also \[he took\] the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink \[it\], in remembrance of me.

25: 

[[1Cor.11.26|26]] For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.

26: 

[[1Cor.11.27|27]] Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink \[this\] cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.

27: 

[[1Cor.11.28|28]] But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of \[that\] bread, and drink of \[that\] cup.

28: 

[[1Cor.11.29|29]] For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.

29: 

[[1Cor.11.30|30]] For this cause many \[are\] weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.

30: 

[[1Cor.11.31|31]] For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.

31: 

[[1Cor.11.32|32]] But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.

32: 

[[1Cor.11.33|33]] Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.

33: 

[[1Cor.11.34|34]] And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.

34:
