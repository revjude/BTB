[[1Cor.7|1 Corinthians 7:1 - 1 Corinthians 7:16]]
*Principles of Marriage*

[[1Cor.7.1|1]] Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: \[It is\] good for a man not to touch a woman.

1: 

[[1Cor.7.2|2]] Nevertheless, \[to avoid\] fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.

2: 

[[1Cor.7.3|3]] Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.

3: 

[[1Cor.7.4|4]] The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.

4: 

[[1Cor.7.5|5]] Defraud ye not one the other, except \[it be\] with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.

5: 

[[1Cor.7.6|6]] But I speak this by permission, \[and\] not of commandment.

6: 

[[1Cor.7.7|7]] For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.

7: 

[[1Cor.7.8|8]] I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.

8: 

[[1Cor.7.9|9]] But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.

9: 

[[1Cor.7.10|10]] And unto the married I command, \[yet\] not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from \[her\] husband:

10: 

[[1Cor.7.11|11]] But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to \[her\] husband: and let not the husband put away \[his\] wife.

11: 

[[1Cor.7.12|12]] But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.

12: 

[[1Cor.7.13|13]] And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.

13: 

[[1Cor.7.14|14]] For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.

14: 

[[1Cor.7.15|15]] But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such \[cases\]: but God hath called us to peace.

15: 

[[1Cor.7.16|16]] For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save \[thy\] husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save \[thy\] wife?

16:
