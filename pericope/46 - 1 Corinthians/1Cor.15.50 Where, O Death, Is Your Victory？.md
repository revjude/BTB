[[1Cor.15|1 Corinthians 15:50 - 1 Corinthians 15:58]]
*Where, O Death, Is Your Victory？*

[[1Cor.15.50|50]] Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.

50: 

[[1Cor.15.51|51]] Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,

51: 

[[1Cor.15.52|52]] In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

52: 

[[1Cor.15.53|53]] For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal \[must\] put on immortality.

53: 

[[1Cor.15.54|54]] So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

54: 

[[1Cor.15.55|55]] O death, where \[is\] thy sting? O grave, where \[is\] thy victory?

55: 

[[1Cor.15.56|56]] The sting of death \[is\] sin; and the strength of sin \[is\] the law.

56: 

[[1Cor.15.57|57]] But thanks \[be\] to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

57: 

[[1Cor.15.58|58]] Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.

58:
