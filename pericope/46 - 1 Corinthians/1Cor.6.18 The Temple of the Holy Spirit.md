[[1Cor.6|1 Corinthians 6:18 - 1 Corinthians 6:20]]
*The Temple of the Holy Spirit*

[[1Cor.6.18|18]] Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.

18: 

[[1Cor.6.19|19]] What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost \[which is\] in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?

19: 

[[1Cor.6.20|20]] For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.

20:
