[[1Cor.7|1 Corinthians 7:17 - 1 Corinthians 7:24]]
*Live Your Calling*

[[1Cor.7.17|17]] But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.

17: 

[[1Cor.7.18|18]] Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.

18: 

[[1Cor.7.19|19]] Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.

19: 

[[1Cor.7.20|20]] Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.

20: 

[[1Cor.7.21|21]] Art thou called \[being\] a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use \[it\] rather.

21: 

[[1Cor.7.22|22]] For he that is called in the Lord, \[being\] a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, \[being\] free, is Christ’s servant.

22: 

[[1Cor.7.23|23]] Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.

23: 

[[1Cor.7.24|24]] Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.

24:
