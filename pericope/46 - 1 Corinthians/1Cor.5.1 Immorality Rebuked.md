[[1Cor.5|1 Corinthians 5:1 - 1 Corinthians 5:8]]
*Immorality Rebuked*

[[1Cor.5.1|1]] It is reported commonly \[that there is\] fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife.

1: 

[[1Cor.5.2|2]] And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.

2: 

[[1Cor.5.3|3]] For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, \[concerning\] him that hath so done this deed,

3: 

[[1Cor.5.4|4]] In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,

4: 

[[1Cor.5.5|5]] To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.

5: 

[[1Cor.5.6|6]] Your glorying \[is\] not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?

6: 

[[1Cor.5.7|7]] Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:

7: 

[[1Cor.5.8|8]] Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened \[bread\] of sincerity and truth.

8:
