[[1Cor.3|1 Corinthians 3:1 - 1 Corinthians 3:9]]
*God’s Fellow Workers*

[[1Cor.3.1|1]] And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, \[even\] as unto babes in Christ.

1: 

[[1Cor.3.2|2]] I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able \[to bear it\], neither yet now are ye able.

2: 

[[1Cor.3.3|3]] For ye are yet carnal: for whereas \[there is\] among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?

3: 

[[1Cor.3.4|4]] For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I \[am\] of Apollos; are ye not carnal?

4: 

[[1Cor.3.5|5]] Who then is Paul, and who \[is\] Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?

5: 

[[1Cor.3.6|6]] I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.

6: 

[[1Cor.3.7|7]] So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.

7: 

[[1Cor.3.8|8]] Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.

8: 

[[1Cor.3.9|9]] For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, \[ye are\] God’s building.

9:
