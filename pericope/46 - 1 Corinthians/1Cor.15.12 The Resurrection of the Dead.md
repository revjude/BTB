[[1Cor.15|1 Corinthians 15:12 - 1 Corinthians 15:19]]
*The Resurrection of the Dead*

[[1Cor.15.12|12]] Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?

12: 

[[1Cor.15.13|13]] But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:

13: 

[[1Cor.15.14|14]] And if Christ be not risen, then \[is\] our preaching vain, and your faith \[is\] also vain.

14: 

[[1Cor.15.15|15]] Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.

15: 

[[1Cor.15.16|16]] For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:

16: 

[[1Cor.15.17|17]] And if Christ be not raised, your faith \[is\] vain; ye are yet in your sins.

17: 

[[1Cor.15.18|18]] Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.

18: 

[[1Cor.15.19|19]] If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.

19:
