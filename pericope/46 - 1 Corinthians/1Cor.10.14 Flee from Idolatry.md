[[1Cor.10|1 Corinthians 10:14 - 1 Corinthians 10:22]]
*Flee from Idolatry*

[[1Cor.10.14|14]] Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.

14: 

[[1Cor.10.15|15]] I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.

15: 

[[1Cor.10.16|16]] The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?

16: 

[[1Cor.10.17|17]] For we \[being\] many are one bread, \[and\] one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.

17: 

[[1Cor.10.18|18]] Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?

18: 

[[1Cor.10.19|19]] What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?

19: 

[[1Cor.10.20|20]] But \[I say\], that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.

20: 

[[1Cor.10.21|21]] Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils.

21: 

[[1Cor.10.22|22]] Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?

22:
