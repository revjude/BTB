[[1Cor.12|1 Corinthians 12:1 - 1 Corinthians 12:11]]
*Spiritual Gifts*

[[1Cor.12.1|1]] Now concerning spiritual \[gifts\], brethren, I would not have you ignorant.

1: 

[[1Cor.12.2|2]] Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.

2: 

[[1Cor.12.3|3]] Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and \[that\] no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.

3: 

[[1Cor.12.4|4]] Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.

4: 

[[1Cor.12.5|5]] And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.

5: 

[[1Cor.12.6|6]] And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.

6: 

[[1Cor.12.7|7]] But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.

7: 

[[1Cor.12.8|8]] For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;

8: 

[[1Cor.12.9|9]] To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;

9: 

[[1Cor.12.10|10]] To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another \[divers\] kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:

10: 

[[1Cor.12.11|11]] But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.

11:
