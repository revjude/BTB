[[1Cor.15|1 Corinthians 15:20 - 1 Corinthians 15:34]]
*The Order of Resurrection*

[[1Cor.15.20|20]] But now is Christ risen from the dead, \[and\] become the firstfruits of them that slept.

20: 

[[1Cor.15.21|21]] For since by man \[came\] death, by man \[came\] also the resurrection of the dead.

21: 

[[1Cor.15.22|22]] For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.

22: 

[[1Cor.15.23|23]] But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming.

23: 

[[1Cor.15.24|24]] Then \[cometh\] the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.

24: 

[[1Cor.15.25|25]] For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.

25: 

[[1Cor.15.26|26]] The last enemy \[that\] shall be destroyed \[is\] death.

26: 

[[1Cor.15.27|27]] For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, all things are put under \[him, it is\] manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.

27: 

[[1Cor.15.28|28]] And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.

28: 

[[1Cor.15.29|29]] Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?

29: 

[[1Cor.15.30|30]] And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?

30: 

[[1Cor.15.31|31]] I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.

31: 

[[1Cor.15.32|32]] If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.

32: 

[[1Cor.15.33|33]] Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.

33: 

[[1Cor.15.34|34]] Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak \[this\] to your shame.

34:
