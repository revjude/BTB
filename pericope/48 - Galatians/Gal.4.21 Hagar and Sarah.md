[[Gal.4|Galatians 4:21 - Galatians 4:31]]
*Hagar and Sarah*

[[Gal.4.21|21]] Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?

21: 

[[Gal.4.22|22]] For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.

22: 

[[Gal.4.23|23]] But he \[who was\] of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman \[was\] by promise.

23: 

[[Gal.4.24|24]] Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.

24: 

[[Gal.4.25|25]] For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.

25: 

[[Gal.4.26|26]] But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.

26: 

[[Gal.4.27|27]] For it is written, Rejoice, \[thou\] barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.

27: 

[[Gal.4.28|28]] Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.

28: 

[[Gal.4.29|29]] But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him \[that was born\] after the Spirit, even so \[it is\] now.

29: 

[[Gal.4.30|30]] Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.

30: 

[[Gal.4.31|31]] So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.

31:
