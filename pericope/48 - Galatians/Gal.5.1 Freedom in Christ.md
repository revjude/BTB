[[Gal.5|Galatians 5:1 - Galatians 5:15]]
*Freedom in Christ*

[[Gal.5.1|1]] Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.

1: 

[[Gal.5.2|2]] Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.

2: 

[[Gal.5.3|3]] For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.

3: 

[[Gal.5.4|4]] Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.

4: 

[[Gal.5.5|5]] For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.

5: 

[[Gal.5.6|6]] For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.

6: 

[[Gal.5.7|7]] Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?

7: 

[[Gal.5.8|8]] This persuasion \[cometh\] not of him that calleth you.

8: 

[[Gal.5.9|9]] A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.

9: 

[[Gal.5.10|10]] I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.

10: 

[[Gal.5.11|11]] And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.

11: 

[[Gal.5.12|12]] I would they were even cut off which trouble you.

12: 

[[Gal.5.13|13]] For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only \[use\] not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.

13: 

[[Gal.5.14|14]] For all the law is fulfilled in one word, \[even\] in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

14: 

[[Gal.5.15|15]] But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.

15:
