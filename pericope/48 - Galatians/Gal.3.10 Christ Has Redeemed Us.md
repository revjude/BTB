[[Gal.3|Galatians 3:10 - Galatians 3:14]]
*Christ Has Redeemed Us*

[[Gal.3.10|10]] For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed \[is\] every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.

10: 

[[Gal.3.11|11]] But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, \[it is\] evident: for, The just shall live by faith.

11: 

[[Gal.3.12|12]] And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.

12: 

[[Gal.3.13|13]] Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed \[is\] every one that hangeth on a tree:

13: 

[[Gal.3.14|14]] That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

14:
