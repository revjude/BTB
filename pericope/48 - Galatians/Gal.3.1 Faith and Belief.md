[[Gal.3|Galatians 3:1 - Galatians 3:9]]
*Faith and Belief*

[[Gal.3.1|1]] O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?

1: 

[[Gal.3.2|2]] This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

2: 

[[Gal.3.3|3]] Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?

3: 

[[Gal.3.4|4]] Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if \[it be\] yet in vain.

4: 

[[Gal.3.5|5]] He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, \[doeth he it\] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

5: 

[[Gal.3.6|6]] Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.

6: 

[[Gal.3.7|7]] Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.

7: 

[[Gal.3.8|8]] And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, \[saying\], In thee shall all nations be blessed.

8: 

[[Gal.3.9|9]] So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.

9:
