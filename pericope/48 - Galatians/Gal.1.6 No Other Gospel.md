[[Gal.1|Galatians 1:6 - Galatians 1:9]]
*No Other Gospel*

[[Gal.1.6|6]] I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:

6: 

[[Gal.1.7|7]] Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.

7: 

[[Gal.1.8|8]] But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.

8: 

[[Gal.1.9|9]] As we said before, so say I now again, If any \[man\] preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.

9:
