[[Gal.2|Galatians 2:1 - Galatians 2:10]]
*The Council at Jerusalem*

[[Gal.2.1|1]] Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with \[me\] also.

1: 

[[Gal.2.2|2]] And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.

2: 

[[Gal.2.3|3]] But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:

3: 

[[Gal.2.4|4]] And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:

4: 

[[Gal.2.5|5]] To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.

5: 

[[Gal.2.6|6]] But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man’s person:) for they who seemed \[to be somewhat\] in conference added nothing to me:

6: 

[[Gal.2.7|7]] But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as \[the gospel\] of the circumcision \[was\] unto Peter;

7: 

[[Gal.2.8|8]] (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)

8: 

[[Gal.2.9|9]] And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we \[should go\] unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.

9: 

[[Gal.2.10|10]] Only \[they would\] that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.

10:
