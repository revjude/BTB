[[Gal.4|Galatians 4:1 - Galatians 4:7]]
*Sons and Heirs*

[[Gal.4.1|1]] Now I say, \[That\] the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;

1: 

[[Gal.4.2|2]] But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.

2: 

[[Gal.4.3|3]] Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:

3: 

[[Gal.4.4|4]] But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,

4: 

[[Gal.4.5|5]] To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.

5: 

[[Gal.4.6|6]] And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

6: 

[[Gal.4.7|7]] Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.

7:
