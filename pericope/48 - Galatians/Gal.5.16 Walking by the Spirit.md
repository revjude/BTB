[[Gal.5|Galatians 5:16 - Galatians 5:26]]
*Walking by the Spirit*

[[Gal.5.16|16]] \[This\] I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.

16: 

[[Gal.5.17|17]] For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.

17: 

[[Gal.5.18|18]] But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.

18: 

[[Gal.5.19|19]] Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are \[these\]; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,

19: 

[[Gal.5.20|20]] Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,

20: 

[[Gal.5.21|21]] Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told \[you\] in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.

21: 

[[Gal.5.22|22]] But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,

22: 

[[Gal.5.23|23]] Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.

23: 

[[Gal.5.24|24]] And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.

24: 

[[Gal.5.25|25]] If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

25: 

[[Gal.5.26|26]] Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.

26:
