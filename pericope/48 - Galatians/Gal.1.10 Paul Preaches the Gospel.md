[[Gal.1|Galatians 1:10 - Galatians 1:24]]
*Paul Preaches the Gospel*

[[Gal.1.10|10]] For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.

10: 

[[Gal.1.11|11]] But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.

11: 

[[Gal.1.12|12]] For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught \[it\], but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

12: 

[[Gal.1.13|13]] For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:

13: 

[[Gal.1.14|14]] And profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.

14: 

[[Gal.1.15|15]] But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called \[me\] by his grace,

15: 

[[Gal.1.16|16]] To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:

16: 

[[Gal.1.17|17]] Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.

17: 

[[Gal.1.18|18]] Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.

18: 

[[Gal.1.19|19]] But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.

19: 

[[Gal.1.20|20]] Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.

20: 

[[Gal.1.21|21]] Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;

21: 

[[Gal.1.22|22]] And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:

22: 

[[Gal.1.23|23]] But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.

23: 

[[Gal.1.24|24]] And they glorified God in me.

24:
