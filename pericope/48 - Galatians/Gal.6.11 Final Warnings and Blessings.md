[[Gal.6|Galatians 6:11 - Galatians 6:18]]
*Final Warnings and Blessings*

[[Gal.6.11|11]] Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.

11: 

[[Gal.6.12|12]] As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.

12: 

[[Gal.6.13|13]] For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.

13: 

[[Gal.6.14|14]] But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.

14: 

[[Gal.6.15|15]] For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.

15: 

[[Gal.6.16|16]] And as many as walk according to this rule, peace \[be\] on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.

16: 

[[Gal.6.17|17]] From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.

17: 

[[Gal.6.18|18]] Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ \[be\] with your spirit. Amen.

18:
