[[Gal.6|Galatians 6:1 - Galatians 6:10]]
*Carry One Another’s Burdens*

[[Gal.6.1|1]] Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.

1: 

[[Gal.6.2|2]] Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.

2: 

[[Gal.6.3|3]] For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.

3: 

[[Gal.6.4|4]] But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.

4: 

[[Gal.6.5|5]] For every man shall bear his own burden.

5: 

[[Gal.6.6|6]] Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.

6: 

[[Gal.6.7|7]] Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.

7: 

[[Gal.6.8|8]] For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.

8: 

[[Gal.6.9|9]] And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.

9: 

[[Gal.6.10|10]] As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all \[men\], especially unto them who are of the household of faith.

10:
