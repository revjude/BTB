[[Mark.13|Mark 13:9 - Mark 13:13]]
*Witnessing to All Nations*

[[Mark.13.9|9]] But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.

9: 

[[Mark.13.10|10]] And the gospel must first be published among all nations.

10: 

[[Mark.13.11|11]] But when they shall lead \[you\], and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.

11: 

[[Mark.13.12|12]] Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against \[their\] parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.

12: 

[[Mark.13.13|13]] And ye shall be hated of all \[men\] for my name’s sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.

13:
