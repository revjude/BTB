[[Mark.10|Mark 10:35 - Mark 10:45]]
*The Request of James and John*

[[Mark.10.35|35]] And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.

35: 

[[Mark.10.36|36]] And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?

36: 

[[Mark.10.37|37]] They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.

37: 

[[Mark.10.38|38]] But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?

38: 

[[Mark.10.39|39]] And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:

39: 

[[Mark.10.40|40]] But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but \[it shall be given to them\] for whom it is prepared.

40: 

[[Mark.10.41|41]] And when the ten heard \[it\], they began to be much displeased with James and John.

41: 

[[Mark.10.42|42]] But Jesus called them \[to him\], and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.

42: 

[[Mark.10.43|43]] But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:

43: 

[[Mark.10.44|44]] And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.

44: 

[[Mark.10.45|45]] For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

45:
