[[Mark.14|Mark 14:27 - Mark 14:31]]
*Jesus Predicts Peter’s Denial*

[[Mark.14.27|27]] And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.

27: 

[[Mark.14.28|28]] But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.

28: 

[[Mark.14.29|29]] But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet \[will\] not I.

29: 

[[Mark.14.30|30]] And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, \[even\] in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.

30: 

[[Mark.14.31|31]] But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.

31:
