[[Mark.9|Mark 9:42 - Mark 9:48]]
*Temptations and Trespasses*

[[Mark.9.42|42]] And whosoever shall offend one of \[these\] little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.

42: 

[[Mark.9.43|43]] And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:

43: 

[[Mark.9.45|45]] And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:

45: 

[[Mark.9.47|47]] And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:

47: 

[[Mark.9.48|48]] Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

48:
