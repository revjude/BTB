[[Mark.4|Mark 4:26 - Mark 4:29]]
*The Seed Growing Secretly*

[[Mark.4.26|26]] And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;

26: 

[[Mark.4.27|27]] And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.

27: 

[[Mark.4.28|28]] For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.

28: 

[[Mark.4.29|29]] But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.

29:
