[[Mark.15|Mark 15:33 - Mark 15:41]]
*The Death of Jesus*

[[Mark.15.33|33]] And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.

33: 

[[Mark.15.34|34]] And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

34: 

[[Mark.15.35|35]] And some of them that stood by, when they heard \[it\], said, Behold, he calleth Elias.

35: 

[[Mark.15.36|36]] And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put \[it\] on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.

36: 

[[Mark.15.37|37]] And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.

37: 

[[Mark.15.38|38]] And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.

38: 

[[Mark.15.39|39]] And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.

39: 

[[Mark.15.40|40]] There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;

40: 

[[Mark.15.41|41]] (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.

41:
