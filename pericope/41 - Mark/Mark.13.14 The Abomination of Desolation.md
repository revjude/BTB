[[Mark.13|Mark 13:14 - Mark 13:23]]
*The Abomination of Desolation*

[[Mark.13.14|14]] But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:

14: 

[[Mark.13.15|15]] And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter \[therein\], to take any thing out of his house:

15: 

[[Mark.13.16|16]] And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.

16: 

[[Mark.13.17|17]] But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!

17: 

[[Mark.13.18|18]] And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.

18: 

[[Mark.13.19|19]] For \[in\] those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.

19: 

[[Mark.13.20|20]] And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect’s sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.

20: 

[[Mark.13.21|21]] And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here \[is\] Christ; or, lo, \[he is\] there; believe \[him\] not:

21: 

[[Mark.13.22|22]] For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if \[it were\] possible, even the elect.

22: 

[[Mark.13.23|23]] But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.

23:
