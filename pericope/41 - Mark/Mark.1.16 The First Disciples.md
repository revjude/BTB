*The First Disciples*

[[Mark.1.16|16]] Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.

16: 

[[Mark.1.17|17]] And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.

17: 

[[Mark.1.18|18]] And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.
