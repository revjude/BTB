[[Mark.4|Mark 4:30 - Mark 4:34]]
*The Parable of the Mustard Seed*

[[Mark.4.30|30]] And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?

30: 

[[Mark.4.31|31]] \[It is\] like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:

31: 

[[Mark.4.32|32]] But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.

32: 

[[Mark.4.33|33]] And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear \[it\].

33: 

[[Mark.4.34|34]] But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.

34:
