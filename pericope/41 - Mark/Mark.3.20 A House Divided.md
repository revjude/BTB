[[Mark.3|Mark 3:20 - Mark 3:27]]
*A House Divided*

[[Mark.3.20|20]] And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.

20: 

[[Mark.3.21|21]] And when his friends heard \[of it\], they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.

21: 

[[Mark.3.22|22]] And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.

22: 

[[Mark.3.23|23]] And he called them \[unto him\], and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?

23: 

[[Mark.3.24|24]] And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.

24: 

[[Mark.3.25|25]] And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.

25: 

[[Mark.3.26|26]] And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.

26: 

[[Mark.3.27|27]] No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.

27:
