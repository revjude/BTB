[[Mark.8|Mark 8:14 - Mark 8:21]]
*The Leaven of the Pharisees and of Herod*

[[Mark.8.14|14]] Now \[the disciples\] had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.

14: 

[[Mark.8.15|15]] And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and \[of\] the leaven of Herod.

15: 

[[Mark.8.16|16]] And they reasoned among themselves, saying, \[It is\] because we have no bread.

16: 

[[Mark.8.17|17]] And when Jesus knew \[it\], he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?

17: 

[[Mark.8.18|18]] Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?

18: 

[[Mark.8.19|19]] When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.

19: 

[[Mark.8.20|20]] And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.

20: 

[[Mark.8.21|21]] And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?

21:
