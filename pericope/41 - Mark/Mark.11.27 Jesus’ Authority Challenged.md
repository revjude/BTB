[[Mark.11|Mark 11:27 - Mark 11:33]]
*Jesus’ Authority Challenged*

[[Mark.11.27|27]] And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,

27: 

[[Mark.11.28|28]] And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?

28: 

[[Mark.11.29|29]] And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.

29: 

[[Mark.11.30|30]] The baptism of John, was \[it\] from heaven, or of men? answer me.

30: 

[[Mark.11.31|31]] And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?

31: 

[[Mark.11.32|32]] But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all \[men\] counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.

32: 

[[Mark.11.33|33]] And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

33:
