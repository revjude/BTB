[[Mark.6|Mark 6:45 - Mark 6:52]]
*Jesus Walks on Water*

[[Mark.6.45|45]] And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.

45: 

[[Mark.6.46|46]] And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.

46: 

[[Mark.6.47|47]] And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.

47: 

[[Mark.6.48|48]] And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.

[[Mark.6.49|49]] But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:

49: 

[[Mark.6.50|50]] For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.

50: 

[[Mark.6.51|51]] And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.

51: 

[[Mark.6.52|52]] For they considered not \[the miracle\] of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.

52:
