[[Mark.7|Mark 7:14 - Mark 7:23]]
*What Defiles a Man*

[[Mark.7.14|14]] And when he had called all the people \[unto him\], he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one \[of you\], and understand:

14: 

[[Mark.7.15|15]] There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.

15: 

[[Mark.7.17|17]] And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.

17: 

[[Mark.7.18|18]] And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, \[it\] cannot defile him;

18: 

[[Mark.7.19|19]] Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?

19: 

[[Mark.7.20|20]] And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.

20: 

[[Mark.7.21|21]] For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,

21: 

[[Mark.7.22|22]] Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:

22: 

[[Mark.7.23|23]] All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.

23:
