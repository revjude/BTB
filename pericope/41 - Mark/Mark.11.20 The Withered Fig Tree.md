[[Mark.11|Mark 11:20 - Mark 11:25]]
*The Withered Fig Tree*

[[Mark.11.20|20]] And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.

20: 

[[Mark.11.21|21]] And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.

21: 

[[Mark.11.22|22]] And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.

22: 

[[Mark.11.23|23]] For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.

23: 

[[Mark.11.24|24]] Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive \[them\], and ye shall have \[them\].

24: 

[[Mark.11.25|25]] And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.

25:
