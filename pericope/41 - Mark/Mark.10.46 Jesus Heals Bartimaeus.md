[[Mark.10|Mark 10:46 - Mark 10:52]]
*Jesus Heals Bartimaeus*

[[Mark.10.46|46]] And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.

46: 

[[Mark.10.47|47]] And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, \[thou\] Son of David, have mercy on me.

47: 

[[Mark.10.48|48]] And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, \[Thou\] Son of David, have mercy on me.

48: 

[[Mark.10.49|49]] And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.

49: 

[[Mark.10.50|50]] And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.

50: 

[[Mark.10.51|51]] And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.

51: 

[[Mark.10.52|52]] And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.

52:
