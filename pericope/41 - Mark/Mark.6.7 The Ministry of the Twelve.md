[[Mark.6|Mark 6:7 - Mark 6:13]]
*The Ministry of the Twelve*

[[Mark.6.7|7]] And he called \[unto him\] the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;

7: 

[[Mark.6.8|8]] And commanded them that they should take nothing for \[their\] journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in \[their\] purse:

8: 

[[Mark.6.9|9]] But \[be\] shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.

9: 

[[Mark.6.10|10]] And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.

10: 

[[Mark.6.11|11]] And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.

11: 

[[Mark.6.12|12]] And they went out, and preached that men should repent.

12: 

[[Mark.6.13|13]] And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed \[them\].

13:
