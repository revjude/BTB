1: 

[[Mark.6.2|2]] And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing \[him\] were astonished, saying, From whence hath this \[man\] these things? and what wisdom \[is\] this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?

2:

5: 

[[Mark.6.6|6]] And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.
