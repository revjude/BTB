[[Mark.10|Mark 10:13 - Mark 10:16]]
*Jesus Blesses the Children*

[[Mark.10.13|13]] And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and \[his\] disciples rebuked those that brought \[them\].

13: 

[[Mark.10.14|14]] But when Jesus saw \[it\], he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.

14: 

[[Mark.10.15|15]] Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.

15: 

[[Mark.10.16|16]] And he took them up in his arms, put \[his\] hands upon them, and blessed them.

16:
