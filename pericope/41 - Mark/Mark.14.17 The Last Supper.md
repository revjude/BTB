[[Mark.14|Mark 14:17 - Mark 14:26]]
*The Last Supper*

[[Mark.14.17|17]] And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.

17: 

[[Mark.14.18|18]] And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.

18: 

[[Mark.14.19|19]] And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, \[Is\] it I? and another \[said, Is\] it I?

19: 

[[Mark.14.20|20]] And he answered and said unto them, \[It is\] one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.

20: 

[[Mark.14.21|21]] The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.

21: 

[[Mark.14.22|22]] And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake \[it\], and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.

22: 

[[Mark.14.23|23]] And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave \[it\] to them: and they all drank of it.

23: 

[[Mark.14.24|24]] And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.

24: 

[[Mark.14.25|25]] Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.

25: 

[[Mark.14.26|26]] And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.

26:
