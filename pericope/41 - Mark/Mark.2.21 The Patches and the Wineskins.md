[[Mark.2|Mark 2:21 - Mark 2:22]]
*The Patches and the Wineskins*

[[Mark.2.21|21]] No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.

21: 

[[Mark.2.22|22]] And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.

22:
