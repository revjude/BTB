[[Mark.9|Mark 9:33 - Mark 9:41]]
*The Greatest in the Kingdom*

[[Mark.9.33|33]] And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?

33: 

[[Mark.9.34|34]] But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who \[should be\] the greatest.

34: 

[[Mark.9.35|35]] And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, \[the same\] shall be last of all, and servant of all.

35: 

[[Mark.9.36|36]] And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,

36: 

[[Mark.9.37|37]] Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.

37: 

[[Mark.9.38|38]] And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.

38: 

[[Mark.9.39|39]] But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.

39: 

[[Mark.9.40|40]] For he that is not against us is on our part.

40: 

[[Mark.9.41|41]] For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.

41:
