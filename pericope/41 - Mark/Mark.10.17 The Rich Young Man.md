[[Mark.10|Mark 10:17 - Mark 10:31]]
*The Rich Young Man*

[[Mark.10.17|17]] And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?

17: 

[[Mark.10.18|18]] And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? \[there is\] none good but one, \[that is\], God.

18: 

[[Mark.10.19|19]] Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.

19: 

[[Mark.10.20|20]] And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.

20: 

[[Mark.10.21|21]] Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.

21: 

[[Mark.10.22|22]] And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.

22: 

[[Mark.10.23|23]] And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!

23: 

[[Mark.10.24|24]] And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!

24: 

[[Mark.10.25|25]] It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

25: 

[[Mark.10.26|26]] And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?

26: 

[[Mark.10.27|27]] And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men \[it is\] impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.

27: 

[[Mark.10.28|28]] Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.

28: 

[[Mark.10.29|29]] And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel’s,

29: 

[[Mark.10.30|30]] But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.

30: 

[[Mark.10.31|31]] But many \[that are\] first shall be last; and the last first.

31:
