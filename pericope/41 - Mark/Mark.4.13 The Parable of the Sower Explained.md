[[Mark.4|Mark 4:13 - Mark 4:20]]
*The Parable of the Sower Explained*

[[Mark.4.13|13]] And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?

13: 

[[Mark.4.14|14]] The sower soweth the word.

14: 

[[Mark.4.15|15]] And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.

15: 

[[Mark.4.16|16]] And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;

16: 

[[Mark.4.17|17]] And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word’s sake, immediately they are offended.

17: 

[[Mark.4.18|18]] And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,

18: 

[[Mark.4.19|19]] And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.

19: 

[[Mark.4.20|20]] And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive \[it\], and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.

20:
