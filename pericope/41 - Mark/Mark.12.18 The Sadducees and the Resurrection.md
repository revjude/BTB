[[Mark.12|Mark 12:18 - Mark 12:27]]
*The Sadducees and the Resurrection*

[[Mark.12.18|18]] Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,

18: 

[[Mark.12.19|19]] Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave \[his\] wife \[behind him\], and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

19: 

[[Mark.12.20|20]] Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.

20: 

[[Mark.12.21|21]] And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.

21: 

[[Mark.12.22|22]] And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.

22: 

[[Mark.12.23|23]] In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.

23: 

[[Mark.12.24|24]] And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?

24: 

[[Mark.12.25|25]] For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.

25: 

[[Mark.12.26|26]] And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I \[am\] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?

26: 

[[Mark.12.27|27]] He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.

27:
