[[Mark.4|Mark 4:35 - Mark 4:41]]
*Jesus Calms the Storm*

[[Mark.4.35|35]] And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.

35: 

[[Mark.4.36|36]] And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.

36: 

[[Mark.4.37|37]] And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.

37: 

[[Mark.4.38|38]] And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?

38: 

[[Mark.4.39|39]] And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.

39: 

[[Mark.4.40|40]] And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?

40: 

[[Mark.4.41|41]] And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?

41:
