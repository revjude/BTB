[[Mark.2|Mark 2:1 - Mark 2:12]]
*Jesus Heals a Paralytic*

[[Mark.2.1|1]] And again he entered into Capernaum, after \[some\] days; and it was noised that he was in the house.

1: 

[[Mark.2.2|2]] And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive \[them\], no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.

2: 

[[Mark.2.3|3]] And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.

3: 

[[Mark.2.4|4]] And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken \[it\] up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.

4: 

[[Mark.2.5|5]] When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.

5: 

[[Mark.2.6|6]] But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,

6: 

[[Mark.2.7|7]] Why doth this \[man\] thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?

7: 

[[Mark.2.8|8]] And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?

8: 

[[Mark.2.9|9]] Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, \[Thy\] sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?

9: 

[[Mark.2.10|10]] But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)

10: 

[[Mark.2.11|11]] I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.

11: 

[[Mark.2.12|12]] And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.

12:
