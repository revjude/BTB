[[Mark.1|Mark 1:1 - Mark 1:11]]
*The Mission of John the Baptist*

[[Mark.1.1|1]] The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;

1: 

[[Mark.1.2|2]] As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

2: 

[[Mark.1.3|3]] The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

3: 

[[Mark.1.4|4]] John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.

4: 

[[Mark.1.5|5]] And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.

5: 

[[Mark.1.6|6]] And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;

6: 

[[Mark.1.7|7]] And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.

7: 

[[Mark.1.8|8]] I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.

8: 

[[Mark.1.9|9]] And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.

9: 

[[Mark.1.10|10]] And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:

10: 

[[Mark.1.11|11]] And there came a voice from heaven, \[saying\], Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

11:
