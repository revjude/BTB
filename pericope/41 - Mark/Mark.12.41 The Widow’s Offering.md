[[Mark.12|Mark 12:41 - Mark 12:44]]
*The Widow’s Offering*

[[Mark.12.41|41]] And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.

41: 

[[Mark.12.42|42]] And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.

42: 

[[Mark.12.43|43]] And he called \[unto him\] his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:

43: 

[[Mark.12.44|44]] For all \[they\] did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, \[even\] all her living.

44:
