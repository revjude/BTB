[[Mark.16|Mark 16:1 - Mark 16:8]]
*The Resurrection*

[[Mark.16.1|1]] And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the \[mother\] of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.

1: 

[[Mark.16.2|2]] And very early in the morning the first \[day\] of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.

2: 

[[Mark.16.3|3]] And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?

3: 

[[Mark.16.4|4]] And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.

4: 

[[Mark.16.5|5]] And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.

5: 

[[Mark.16.6|6]] And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.

6: 

[[Mark.16.7|7]] But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.

7: 

[[Mark.16.8|8]] And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any \[man\]; for they were afraid.

8:
