[[Mark.8|Mark 8:1 - Mark 8:10]]
*The Feeding of the Four Thousand*

[[Mark.8.1|1]] In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples \[unto him\], and saith unto them,

1: 

[[Mark.8.2|2]] I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:

2: 

[[Mark.8.3|3]] And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.

3: 

[[Mark.8.4|4]] And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these \[men\] with bread here in the wilderness?

4: 

[[Mark.8.5|5]] And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.

5: 

[[Mark.8.6|6]] And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before \[them\]; and they did set \[them\] before the people.

6: 

[[Mark.8.7|7]] And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before \[them\].

7: 

[[Mark.8.8|8]] So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken \[meat\] that was left seven baskets.

8: 

[[Mark.8.9|9]] And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.

9: 

[[Mark.8.10|10]] And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.

10:
