[[Mark.7|Mark 7:1 - Mark 7:13]]
*The Tradition of the Elders*

[[Mark.7.1|1]] Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.

1: 

[[Mark.7.2|2]] And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.

2: 

[[Mark.7.3|3]] For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash \[their\] hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.

3: 

[[Mark.7.4|4]] And \[when they come\] from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, \[as\] the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.

4: 

[[Mark.7.5|5]] Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?

5: 

[[Mark.7.6|6]] He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with \[their\] lips, but their heart is far from me.

6: 

[[Mark.7.7|7]] Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching \[for\] doctrines the commandments of men.

7: 

[[Mark.7.8|8]] For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, \[as\] the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.

8: 

[[Mark.7.9|9]] And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.

9: 

[[Mark.7.10|10]] For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:

10: 

[[Mark.7.11|11]] But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, \[It is\] Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; \[he shall be free\].

11: 

[[Mark.7.12|12]] And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;

12: 

[[Mark.7.13|13]] Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.

13:
