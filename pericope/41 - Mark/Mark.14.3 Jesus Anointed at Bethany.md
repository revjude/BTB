[[Mark.14|Mark 14:3 - Mark 14:9]]
*Jesus Anointed at Bethany*

[[Mark.14.3|3]] And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured \[it\] on his head.

3: 

[[Mark.14.4|4]] And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?

4: 

[[Mark.14.5|5]] For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.

5: 

[[Mark.14.6|6]] And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.

6: 

[[Mark.14.7|7]] For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.

7: 

[[Mark.14.8|8]] She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.

8: 

[[Mark.14.9|9]] Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, \[this\] also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.

9:
