[[Mark.2|Mark 2:13 - Mark 2:17]]
*Jesus Calls Levi*

[[Mark.2.13|13]] And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.

13: 

[[Mark.2.14|14]] And as he passed by, he saw Levi the \[son\] of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.

14: 

[[Mark.2.15|15]] And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.

15: 

[[Mark.2.16|16]] And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?

16: 

[[Mark.2.17|17]] When Jesus heard \[it\], he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

17:
