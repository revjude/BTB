[[Mark.11|Mark 11:1 - Mark 11:11]]
*The Triumphal Entry*

[[Mark.11.1|1]] And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,

1: 

[[Mark.11.2|2]] And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring \[him\].

2: 

[[Mark.11.3|3]] And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.

3: 

[[Mark.11.4|4]] And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.

4: 

[[Mark.11.5|5]] And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?

5: 

[[Mark.11.6|6]] And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.

6: 

[[Mark.11.7|7]] And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.

7: 

[[Mark.11.8|8]] And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed \[them\] in the way.

8: 

[[Mark.11.9|9]] And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed \[is\] he that cometh in the name of the Lord:

9: 

[[Mark.11.10|10]] Blessed \[be\] the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.

10: 

[[Mark.11.11|11]] And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.

11:
