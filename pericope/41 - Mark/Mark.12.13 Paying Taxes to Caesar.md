[[Mark.12|Mark 12:13 - Mark 12:17]]
*Paying Taxes to Caesar*

[[Mark.12.13|13]] And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in \[his\] words.

13: 

[[Mark.12.14|14]] And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?

14: 

[[Mark.12.15|15]] Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see \[it\].

15: 

[[Mark.12.16|16]] And they brought \[it\]. And he saith unto them, Whose \[is\] this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar’s.

16: 

[[Mark.12.17|17]] And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they marvelled at him.

17:
