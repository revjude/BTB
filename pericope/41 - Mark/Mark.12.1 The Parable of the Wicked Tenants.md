[[Mark.12|Mark 12:1 - Mark 12:12]]
*The Parable of the Wicked Tenants*

[[Mark.12.1|1]] And he began to speak unto them by parables. A \[certain\] man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about \[it\], and digged \[a place for\] the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.

1: 

[[Mark.12.2|2]] And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.

2: 

[[Mark.12.3|3]] And they caught \[him\], and beat him, and sent \[him\] away empty.

3: 

[[Mark.12.4|4]] And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded \[him\] in the head, and sent \[him\] away shamefully handled.

4: 

[[Mark.12.5|5]] And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.

5: 

[[Mark.12.6|6]] Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.

6: 

[[Mark.12.7|7]] But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.

7: 

[[Mark.12.8|8]] And they took him, and killed \[him\], and cast \[him\] out of the vineyard.

8: 

[[Mark.12.9|9]] What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.

9: 

[[Mark.12.10|10]] And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:

10: 

[[Mark.12.11|11]] This was the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?

11: 

[[Mark.12.12|12]] And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.

12:
