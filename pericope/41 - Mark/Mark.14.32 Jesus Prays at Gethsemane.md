[[Mark.14|Mark 14:32 - Mark 14:42]]
*Jesus Prays at Gethsemane*

[[Mark.14.32|32]] And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.

32: 

[[Mark.14.33|33]] And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;

33: 

[[Mark.14.34|34]] And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.

34: 

[[Mark.14.35|35]] And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.

35: 

[[Mark.14.36|36]] And he said, Abba, Father, all things \[are\] possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.

36: 

[[Mark.14.37|37]] And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?

37: 

[[Mark.14.38|38]] Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly \[is\] ready, but the flesh \[is\] weak.

38: 

[[Mark.14.39|39]] And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.

39: 

[[Mark.14.40|40]] And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.

40: 

[[Mark.14.41|41]] And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take \[your\] rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

41: 

[[Mark.14.42|42]] Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.

42:
