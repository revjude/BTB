[[Mark.10|Mark 10:32 - Mark 10:34]]
*The Third Prediction of the Passion*

[[Mark.10.32|32]] And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,

32: 

[[Mark.10.33|33]] \[Saying\], Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:

33: 

[[Mark.10.34|34]] And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.

34:
