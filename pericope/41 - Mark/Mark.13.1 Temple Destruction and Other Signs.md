[[Mark.13|Mark 13:1 - Mark 13:8]]
*Temple Destruction and Other Signs*

[[Mark.13.1|1]] And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings \[are here\]!

1: 

[[Mark.13.2|2]] And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.

2: 

[[Mark.13.3|3]] And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,

3: 

[[Mark.13.4|4]] Tell us, when shall these things be? and what \[shall be\] the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?

4: 

[[Mark.13.5|5]] And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any \[man\] deceive you:

5: 

[[Mark.13.6|6]] For many shall come in my name, saying, I am \[Christ\]; and shall deceive many.

6: 

[[Mark.13.7|7]] And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for \[such things\] must needs be; but the end \[shall\] not \[be\] yet.

7: 

[[Mark.13.8|8]] For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these \[are\] the beginnings of sorrows.

8:
