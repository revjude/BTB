[[Mark.7|Mark 7:24 - Mark 7:30]]
*The Faith of the Gentile Woman*

[[Mark.7.24|24]] And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know \[it\]: but he could not be hid.

24: 

[[Mark.7.25|25]] For a \[certain\] woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:

25: 

[[Mark.7.26|26]] The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.

26: 

[[Mark.7.27|27]] But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast \[it\] unto the dogs.

27: 

[[Mark.7.28|28]] And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.

28: 

[[Mark.7.29|29]] And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.

29: 

[[Mark.7.30|30]] And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.

30:
