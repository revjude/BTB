[[Mark.4|Mark 4:21 - Mark 4:25]]
*The Lesson of the Lamp*

[[Mark.4.21|21]] And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?

21: 

[[Mark.4.22|22]] For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.

22: 

[[Mark.4.23|23]] If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.

23: 

[[Mark.4.24|24]] And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.

24: 

[[Mark.4.25|25]] For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.

25:
