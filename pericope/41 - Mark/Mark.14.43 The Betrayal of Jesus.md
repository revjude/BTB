[[Mark.14|Mark 14:43 - Mark 14:52]]
*The Betrayal of Jesus*

[[Mark.14.43|43]] And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.

43: 

[[Mark.14.44|44]] And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead \[him\] away safely.

44: 

[[Mark.14.45|45]] And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.

45: 

[[Mark.14.46|46]] And they laid their hands on him, and took him.

46: 

[[Mark.14.47|47]] And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.

47: 

[[Mark.14.48|48]] And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and \[with\] staves to take me?

48: 

[[Mark.14.49|49]] I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.

49: 

[[Mark.14.50|50]] And they all forsook him, and fled.

50: 

[[Mark.14.51|51]] And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about \[his\] naked \[body\]; and the young men laid hold on him:

51: 

[[Mark.14.52|52]] And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.

52:
