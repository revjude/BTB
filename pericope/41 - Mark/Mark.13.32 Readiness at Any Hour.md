[[Mark.13|Mark 13:32 - Mark 13:37]]
*Readiness at Any Hour*

[[Mark.13.32|32]] But of that day and \[that\] hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.

32: 

[[Mark.13.33|33]] Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.

33: 

[[Mark.13.34|34]] \[For the Son of man is\] as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.

34: 

[[Mark.13.35|35]] Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:

35: 

[[Mark.13.36|36]] Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.

36: 

[[Mark.13.37|37]] And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.

37:
