[[Mark.8|Mark 8:11 - Mark 8:13]]
*The Demand for a Sign*

[[Mark.8.11|11]] And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.

11: 

[[Mark.8.12|12]] And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.

12: 

[[Mark.8.13|13]] And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.

13:
