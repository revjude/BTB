[[Mark.7|Mark 7:31 - Mark 7:37]]
*The Deaf and Mute Man*

[[Mark.7.31|31]] And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.

31: 

[[Mark.7.32|32]] And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.

32: 

[[Mark.7.33|33]] And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;

33: 

[[Mark.7.34|34]] And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.

34: 

[[Mark.7.35|35]] And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.

35: 

[[Mark.7.36|36]] And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published \[it\];

36: 

[[Mark.7.37|37]] And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.

37:
