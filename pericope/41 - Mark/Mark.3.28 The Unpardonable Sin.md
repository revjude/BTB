[[Mark.3|Mark 3:28 - Mark 3:30]]
*The Unpardonable Sin*

[[Mark.3.28|28]] Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:

28: 

[[Mark.3.29|29]] But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:

29: 

[[Mark.3.30|30]] Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.

30:
