[[Mark.8|Mark 8:22 - Mark 8:26]]
*The Blind Man at Bethsaida*

[[Mark.8.22|22]] And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.

22: 

[[Mark.8.23|23]] And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.

23: 

[[Mark.8.24|24]] And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.

24: 

[[Mark.8.25|25]] After that he put \[his\] hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.

25: 

[[Mark.8.26|26]] And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell \[it\] to any in the town.

26:
