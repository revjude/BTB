[[Mark.1|Mark 1:40 - Mark 1:45]]
*The Leper’s Prayer*

[[Mark.1.40|40]] And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

40: 

[[Mark.1.41|41]] And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth \[his\] hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.

41: 

[[Mark.1.42|42]] And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.

42: 

[[Mark.1.43|43]] And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;

43: 

[[Mark.1.44|44]] And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.

44: 

[[Mark.1.45|45]] But he went out, and began to publish \[it\] much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.

45:
