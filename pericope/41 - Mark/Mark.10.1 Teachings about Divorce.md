[[Mark.10.2|2]] And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away \[his\] wife? tempting him.

2: 

[[Mark.10.3|3]] And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?

3: 

[[Mark.10.4|4]] And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put \[her\] away.

[[Mark.10.5|5]] And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.

5: 

[[Mark.10.6|6]] But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.

6: 

[[Mark.10.7|7]] For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;

7: 

[[Mark.10.8|8]] And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.

8: 

[[Mark.10.9|9]] What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.

9: 

[[Mark.10.10|10]] And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same \[matter\].

[[Mark.10.11|11]] And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.

11: 

[[Mark.10.12|12]] And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.
