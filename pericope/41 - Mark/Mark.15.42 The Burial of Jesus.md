42: 

[[Mark.15.43|43]] Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counseller, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.

43: 

[[Mark.15.44|44]] And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling \[unto him\] the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.

44: 

[[Mark.15.45|45]] And when he knew \[it\] of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.

45: 

[[Mark.15.46|46]] And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.

46: 

[[Mark.15.47|47]] And Mary Magdalene and Mary \[the mother\] of Joses beheld where he was laid.
