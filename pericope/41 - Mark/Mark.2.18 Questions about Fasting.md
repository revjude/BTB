[[Mark.2|Mark 2:18 - Mark 2:20]]
*Questions about Fasting*

[[Mark.2.18|18]] And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?

18: 

[[Mark.2.19|19]] And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.

19: 

[[Mark.2.20|20]] But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.

20:
