[[Mark.8|Mark 8:34 - Mark 8:38]]
*Take Up Your Cross*

[[Mark.8.34|34]] And when he had called the people \[unto him\] with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

34: 

[[Mark.8.35|35]] For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it.

35: 

[[Mark.8.36|36]] For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?

36: 

[[Mark.8.37|37]] Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

37: 

[[Mark.8.38|38]] Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.

38:
