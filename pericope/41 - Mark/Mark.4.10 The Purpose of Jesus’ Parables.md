[[Mark.4|Mark 4:10 - Mark 4:12]]
*The Purpose of Jesus’ Parables*

[[Mark.4.10|10]] And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.

10: 

[[Mark.4.11|11]] And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all \[these\] things are done in parables:

11: 

[[Mark.4.12|12]] That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and \[their\] sins should be forgiven them.

12:
