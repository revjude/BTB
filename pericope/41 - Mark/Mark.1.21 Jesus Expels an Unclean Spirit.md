[[Mark.1|Mark 1:21 - Mark 1:28]]
*Jesus Expels an Unclean Spirit*

[[Mark.1.21|21]] And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.

21: 

[[Mark.1.22|22]] And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.

22: 

[[Mark.1.23|23]] And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,

23: 

[[Mark.1.24|24]] Saying, Let \[us\] alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.

24: 

[[Mark.1.25|25]] And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.

25: 

[[Mark.1.26|26]] And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.

26: 

[[Mark.1.27|27]] And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine \[is\] this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.

27: 

[[Mark.1.28|28]] And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.

28:
