[[Mark.9|Mark 9:14 - Mark 9:29]]
*The Boy with an Evil Spirit*

[[Mark.9.14|14]] And when he came to \[his\] disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.

14: 

[[Mark.9.15|15]] And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to \[him\] saluted him.

15: 

[[Mark.9.16|16]] And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?

16: 

[[Mark.9.17|17]] And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;

17: 

[[Mark.9.18|18]] And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not.

18: 

[[Mark.9.19|19]] He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.

19: 

[[Mark.9.20|20]] And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.

20: 

[[Mark.9.21|21]] And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child.

21: 

[[Mark.9.22|22]] And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.

22: 

[[Mark.9.23|23]] Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things \[are\] possible to him that believeth.

23: 

[[Mark.9.24|24]] And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.

24: 

[[Mark.9.25|25]] When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, \[Thou\] dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.

25: 

[[Mark.9.26|26]] And \[the spirit\] cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.

26: 

[[Mark.9.27|27]] But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.

27: 

[[Mark.9.28|28]] And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?

28: 

[[Mark.9.29|29]] And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.
