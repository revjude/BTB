[[Mark.13|Mark 13:24 - Mark 13:27]]
*The Return of the Son of Man*

[[Mark.13.24|24]] But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,

24: 

[[Mark.13.25|25]] And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.

25: 

[[Mark.13.26|26]] And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.

26: 

[[Mark.13.27|27]] And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.

27:
