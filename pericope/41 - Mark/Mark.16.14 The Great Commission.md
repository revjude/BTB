[[Mark.16|Mark 16:14 - Mark 16:18]]
*The Great Commission*

[[Mark.16.14|14]] Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.

14: 

[[Mark.16.15|15]] And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.

15: 

[[Mark.16.16|16]] He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.

16: 

[[Mark.16.17|17]] And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;

17: 

[[Mark.16.18|18]] They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.

18:
