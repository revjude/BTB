[[Mark.14|Mark 14:53 - Mark 14:65]]
*Jesus before the Sanhedrin*

[[Mark.14.53|53]] And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.

53: 

[[Mark.14.54|54]] And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.

54: 

[[Mark.14.55|55]] And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.

55: 

[[Mark.14.56|56]] For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.

56: 

[[Mark.14.57|57]] And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,

57: 

[[Mark.14.58|58]] We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.

58: 

[[Mark.14.59|59]] But neither so did their witness agree together.

59: 

[[Mark.14.60|60]] And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what \[is it which\] these witness against thee?

60: 

[[Mark.14.61|61]] But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?

61: 

[[Mark.14.62|62]] And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.

62: 

[[Mark.14.63|63]] Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?

63: 

[[Mark.14.64|64]] Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.

64: 

[[Mark.14.65|65]] And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.

65:
