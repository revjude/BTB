[[Mark.12|Mark 12:28 - Mark 12:34]]
*The Greatest Commandment*

[[Mark.12.28|28]] And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?

28: 

[[Mark.12.29|29]] And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments \[is\], Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:

29: 

[[Mark.12.30|30]] And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this \[is\] the first commandment.

30: 

[[Mark.12.31|31]] And the second \[is\] like, \[namely\] this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.

31: 

[[Mark.12.32|32]] And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:

32: 

[[Mark.12.33|33]] And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love \[his\] neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.

33: 

[[Mark.12.34|34]] And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him \[any question\].

34:
