*The Parable of the Sower*

2: 

[[Mark.4.3|3]] Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:

3: 

[[Mark.4.4|4]] And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.

4: 

[[Mark.4.5|5]] And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:

5: 

[[Mark.4.6|6]] But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.

[[Mark.4.7|7]] And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.

7: 

[[Mark.4.8|8]] And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.

8: 

[[Mark.4.9|9]] And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

9:
