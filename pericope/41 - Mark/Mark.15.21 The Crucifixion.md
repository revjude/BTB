[[Mark.15|Mark 15:21 - Mark 15:32]]
*The Crucifixion*

[[Mark.15.21|21]] And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.

21: 

[[Mark.15.22|22]] And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.

22: 

[[Mark.15.23|23]] And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received \[it\] not.

23: 

[[Mark.15.24|24]] And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.

24: 

[[Mark.15.25|25]] And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.

25: 

[[Mark.15.26|26]] And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

26: 

[[Mark.15.27|27]] And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.

27: 

[[Mark.15.29|29]] And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest \[it\] in three days,

29: 

[[Mark.15.30|30]] Save thyself, and come down from the cross.

30: 

[[Mark.15.31|31]] Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.

31: 

[[Mark.15.32|32]] Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.

32:
