[[Deut.6|Deuteronomy 6:20 - Deuteronomy 6:25]]
*Teach Your Children*

[[Deut.6.20|20]] \[And\] when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What \[mean\] the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you?

20: 

[[Deut.6.21|21]] Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh’s bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:

21: 

[[Deut.6.22|22]] And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:

22: 

[[Deut.6.23|23]] And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.

23: 

[[Deut.6.24|24]] And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as \[it is\] at this day.

24: 

[[Deut.6.25|25]] And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.

25:
