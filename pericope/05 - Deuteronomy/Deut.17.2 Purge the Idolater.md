[[Deut.17|Deuteronomy 17:2 - Deuteronomy 17:7]]
*Purge the Idolater*

[[Deut.17.2|2]] If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing his covenant,

2: 

[[Deut.17.3|3]] And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;

3: 

[[Deut.17.4|4]] And it be told thee, and thou hast heard \[of it\], and inquired diligently, and, behold, \[it be\] true, \[and\] the thing certain, \[that\] such abomination is wrought in Israel:

4: 

[[Deut.17.5|5]] Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, \[even\] that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die.

5: 

[[Deut.17.6|6]] At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; \[but\] at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.

6: 

[[Deut.17.7|7]] The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt put the evil away from among you.

7:
