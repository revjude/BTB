[[Deut.16|Deuteronomy 16:18 - Deuteronomy 16:20]]
*Judges and Justice*

[[Deut.16.18|18]] Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment.

18: 

[[Deut.16.19|19]] Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.

19: 

[[Deut.16.20|20]] That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

20:
