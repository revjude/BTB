[[Deut.23|Deuteronomy 23:15 - Deuteronomy 23:25]]
*Miscellaneous Laws*

[[Deut.23.15|15]] Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee:

15: 

[[Deut.23.16|16]] He shall dwell with thee, \[even\] among you, in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best: thou shalt not oppress him.

16: 

[[Deut.23.17|17]] There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel.

17: 

[[Deut.23.18|18]] Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow: for even both these \[are\] abomination unto the LORD thy God.

18: 

[[Deut.23.19|19]] Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury:

19: 

[[Deut.23.20|20]] Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it.

20: 

[[Deut.23.21|21]] When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.

21: 

[[Deut.23.22|22]] But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.

22: 

[[Deut.23.23|23]] That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; \[even\] a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the LORD thy God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth.

23: 

[[Deut.23.24|24]] When thou comest into thy neighbour’s vineyard, then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put \[any\] in thy vessel.

24: 

[[Deut.23.25|25]] When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour, then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour’s standing corn.

25:
