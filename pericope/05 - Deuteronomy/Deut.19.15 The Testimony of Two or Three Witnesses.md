[[Deut.19|Deuteronomy 19:15 - Deuteronomy 19:21]]
*The Testimony of Two or Three Witnesses*

[[Deut.19.15|15]] One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.

15: 

[[Deut.19.16|16]] If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him \[that which is\] wrong;

16: 

[[Deut.19.17|17]] Then both the men, between whom the controversy \[is\], shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those days;

17: 

[[Deut.19.18|18]] And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, \[if\] the witness \[be\] a false witness, \[and\] hath testified falsely against his brother;

18: 

[[Deut.19.19|19]] Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.

19: 

[[Deut.19.20|20]] And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.

20: 

[[Deut.19.21|21]] And thine eye shall not pity; \[but\] life \[shall go\] for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.

21:
