[[Deut.15|Deuteronomy 15:7 - Deuteronomy 15:11]]
*Generosity in Lending and Giving*

[[Deut.15.7|7]] If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother:

7: 

[[Deut.15.8|8]] But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, \[in that\] which he wanteth.

8: 

[[Deut.15.9|9]] Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee.

9: 

[[Deut.15.10|10]] Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.

10: 

[[Deut.15.11|11]] For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.

11:
