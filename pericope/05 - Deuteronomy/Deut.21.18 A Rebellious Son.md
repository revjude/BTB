[[Deut.21|Deuteronomy 21:18 - Deuteronomy 21:21]]
*A Rebellious Son*

[[Deut.21.18|18]] If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and \[that\], when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:

18: 

[[Deut.21.19|19]] Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;

19: 

[[Deut.21.20|20]] And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son \[is\] stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; \[he is\] a glutton, and a drunkard.

20: 

[[Deut.21.21|21]] And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.

21:
