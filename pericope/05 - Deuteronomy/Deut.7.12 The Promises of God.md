[[Deut.7|Deuteronomy 7:12 - Deuteronomy 7:26]]
*The Promises of God*

[[Deut.7.12|12]] Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:

12: 

[[Deut.7.13|13]] And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.

13: 

[[Deut.7.14|14]] Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.

14: 

[[Deut.7.15|15]] And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon all \[them\] that hate thee.

15: 

[[Deut.7.16|16]] And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that \[will be\] a snare unto thee.

16: 

[[Deut.7.17|17]] If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations \[are\] more than I; how can I dispossess them?

17: 

[[Deut.7.18|18]] Thou shalt not be afraid of them: \[but\] shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;

18: 

[[Deut.7.19|19]] The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.

19: 

[[Deut.7.20|20]] Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.

20: 

[[Deut.7.21|21]] Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God \[is\] among you, a mighty God and terrible.

21: 

[[Deut.7.22|22]] And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.

22: 

[[Deut.7.23|23]] But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.

23: 

[[Deut.7.24|24]] And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.

24: 

[[Deut.7.25|25]] The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold \[that is\] on them, nor take \[it\] unto thee, lest thou be snared therein: for it \[is\] an abomination to the LORD thy God.

25: 

[[Deut.7.26|26]] Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: \[but\] thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it \[is\] a cursed thing.

26:
