[[Deut.27|Deuteronomy 27:11 - Deuteronomy 27:26]]
*Curses Pronounced from Ebal*

[[Deut.27.11|11]] And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,

11: 

[[Deut.27.12|12]] These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when ye are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:

12: 

[[Deut.27.13|13]] And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.

13: 

[[Deut.27.14|14]] And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice,

14: 

[[Deut.27.15|15]] Cursed \[be\] the man that maketh \[any\] graven or molten image, an abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and putteth \[it\] in \[a\] secret \[place\]. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen.

15: 

[[Deut.27.16|16]] Cursed \[be\] he that setteth light by his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.

16: 

[[Deut.27.17|17]] Cursed \[be\] he that removeth his neighbour’s landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen.

17: 

[[Deut.27.18|18]] Cursed \[be\] he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way. And all the people shall say, Amen.

18: 

[[Deut.27.19|19]] Cursed \[be\] he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.

19: 

[[Deut.27.20|20]] Cursed \[be\] he that lieth with his father’s wife; because he uncovereth his father’s skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen.

20: 

[[Deut.27.21|21]] Cursed \[be\] he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the people shall say, Amen.

21: 

[[Deut.27.22|22]] Cursed \[be\] he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.

22: 

[[Deut.27.23|23]] Cursed \[be\] he that lieth with his mother in law. And all the people shall say, Amen.

23: 

[[Deut.27.24|24]] Cursed \[be\] he that smiteth his neighbour secretly. And all the people shall say, Amen.

24: 

[[Deut.27.25|25]] Cursed \[be\] he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person. And all the people shall say, Amen.

25: 

[[Deut.27.26|26]] Cursed \[be\] he that confirmeth not \[all\] the words of this law to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen.
