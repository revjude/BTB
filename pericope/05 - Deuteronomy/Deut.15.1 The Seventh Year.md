[[Deut.15|Deuteronomy 15:1 - Deuteronomy 15:6]]
*The Seventh Year*

[[Deut.15.1|1]] At the end of \[every\] seven years thou shalt make a release.

1: 

[[Deut.15.2|2]] And this \[is\] the manner of the release: Every creditor that lendeth \[ought\] unto his neighbour shall release \[it\]; he shall not exact \[it\] of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD’S release.

2: 

[[Deut.15.3|3]] Of a foreigner thou mayest exact \[it again\]: but \[that\] which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release;

3: 

[[Deut.15.4|4]] Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee \[for\] an inheritance to possess it:

4: 

[[Deut.15.5|5]] Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day.

5: 

[[Deut.15.6|6]] For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.

6:
