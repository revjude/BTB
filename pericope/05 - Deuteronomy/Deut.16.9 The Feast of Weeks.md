[[Deut.16|Deuteronomy 16:9 - Deuteronomy 16:12]]
*The Feast of Weeks*

[[Deut.16.9|9]] Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the seven weeks from \[such time as\] thou beginnest \[to put\] the sickle to the corn.

9: 

[[Deut.16.10|10]] And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt give \[unto the LORD thy God\], according as the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:

10: 

[[Deut.16.11|11]] And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that \[is\] within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that \[are\] among you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there.

11: 

[[Deut.16.12|12]] And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes.

12:
