[[Deut.3|Deuteronomy 3:12 - Deuteronomy 3:22]]
*Land Division East of the Jordan*

[[Deut.3.12|12]] And this land, \[which\] we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which \[is\] by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.

12: 

[[Deut.3.13|13]] And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, \[being\] the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.

13: 

[[Deut.3.14|14]] Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.

14: 

[[Deut.3.15|15]] And I gave Gilead unto Machir.

15: 

[[Deut.3.16|16]] And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, \[which is\] the border of the children of Ammon;

16: 

[[Deut.3.17|17]] The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast \[thereof\], from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, \[even\] the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.

17: 

[[Deut.3.18|18]] And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all \[that are\] meet for the war.

18: 

[[Deut.3.19|19]] But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (\[for\] I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;

19: 

[[Deut.3.20|20]] Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and \[until\] they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and \[then\] shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.

20: 

[[Deut.3.21|21]] And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.

21: 

[[Deut.3.22|22]] Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.

22:
