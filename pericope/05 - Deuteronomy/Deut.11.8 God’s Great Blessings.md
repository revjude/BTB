[[Deut.11|Deuteronomy 11:8 - Deuteronomy 11:17]]
*God’s Great Blessings*

[[Deut.11.8|8]] Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it;

8: 

[[Deut.11.9|9]] And that ye may prolong \[your\] days in the land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.

9: 

[[Deut.11.10|10]] For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, \[is\] not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst \[it\] with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:

10: 

[[Deut.11.11|11]] But the land, whither ye go to possess it, \[is\] a land of hills and valleys, \[and\] drinketh water of the rain of heaven:

11: 

[[Deut.11.12|12]] A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God \[are\] always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.

12: 

[[Deut.11.13|13]] And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,

13: 

[[Deut.11.14|14]] That I will give \[you\] the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.

14: 

[[Deut.11.15|15]] And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.

15: 

[[Deut.11.16|16]] Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;

16: 

[[Deut.11.17|17]] And \[then\] the LORD’S wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and \[lest\] ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.

17:
