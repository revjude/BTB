[[Deut.22|Deuteronomy 22:13 - Deuteronomy 22:30]]
*Marriage Violations*

[[Deut.22.13|13]] If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,

13: 

[[Deut.22.14|14]] And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid:

14: 

[[Deut.22.15|15]] Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth \[the tokens of\] the damsel’s virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate:

15: 

[[Deut.22.16|16]] And the damsel’s father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;

16: 

[[Deut.22.17|17]] And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech \[against her\], saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these \[are the tokens of\] my daughter’s virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.

17: 

[[Deut.22.18|18]] And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;

18: 

[[Deut.22.19|19]] And they shall amerce him in an hundred \[shekels\] of silver, and give \[them\] unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.

19: 

[[Deut.22.20|20]] But if this thing be true, \[and the tokens of\] virginity be not found for the damsel:

20: 

[[Deut.22.21|21]] Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father’s house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you.

21: 

[[Deut.22.22|22]] If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, \[both\] the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.

22: 

[[Deut.22.23|23]] If a damsel \[that is\] a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;

23: 

[[Deut.22.24|24]] Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, \[being\] in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour’s wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you.

24: 

[[Deut.22.25|25]] But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die:

25: 

[[Deut.22.26|26]] But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; \[there is\] in the damsel no sin \[worthy\] of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so \[is\] this matter:

26: 

[[Deut.22.27|27]] For he found her in the field, \[and\] the betrothed damsel cried, and \[there was\] none to save her.

27: 

[[Deut.22.28|28]] If a man find a damsel \[that is\] a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;

28: 

[[Deut.22.29|29]] Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel’s father fifty \[shekels\] of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.

29: 

[[Deut.22.30|30]] A man shall not take his father’s wife, nor discover his father’s skirt.

30:
