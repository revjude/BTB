[[Deut.5|Deuteronomy 5:5 - Deuteronomy 5:21]]
*The Ten Commandments*

[[Deut.5.5|5]] (I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,

5: 

[[Deut.5.6|6]] I \[am\] the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

6: 

[[Deut.5.7|7]] Thou shalt have none other gods before me.

7: 

[[Deut.5.8|8]] Thou shalt not make thee \[any\] graven image, \[or\] any likeness \[of any thing\] that \[is\] in heaven above, or that \[is\] in the earth beneath, or that \[is\] in the waters beneath the earth:

8: 

[[Deut.5.9|9]] Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God \[am\] a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth \[generation\] of them that hate me,

9: 

[[Deut.5.10|10]] And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.

10: 

[[Deut.5.11|11]] Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold \[him\] guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

11: 

[[Deut.5.12|12]] Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee.

12: 

[[Deut.5.13|13]] Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:

13: 

[[Deut.5.14|14]] But the seventh day \[is\] the sabbath of the LORD thy God: \[in it\] thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that \[is\] within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.

14: 

[[Deut.5.15|15]] And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and \[that\] the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.

15: 

[[Deut.5.16|16]] Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

16: 

[[Deut.5.17|17]] Thou shalt not kill.

17: 

[[Deut.5.18|18]] Neither shalt thou commit adultery.

18: 

[[Deut.5.19|19]] Neither shalt thou steal.

19: 

[[Deut.5.20|20]] Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.

20: 

[[Deut.5.21|21]] Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour’s wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour’s house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any \[thing\] that \[is\] thy neighbour’s.

21:
