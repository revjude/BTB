[[Deut.25|Deuteronomy 25:5 - Deuteronomy 25:12]]
*Widowhood and Marriage*

[[Deut.25.5|5]] If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband’s brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband’s brother unto her.

5: 

[[Deut.25.6|6]] And it shall be, \[that\] the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother \[which is\] dead, that his name be not put out of Israel.

6: 

[[Deut.25.7|7]] And if the man like not to take his brother’s wife, then let his brother’s wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband’s brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband’s brother.

7: 

[[Deut.25.8|8]] Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and \[if\] he stand \[to it\], and say, I like not to take her;

8: 

[[Deut.25.9|9]] Then shall his brother’s wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother’s house.

9: 

[[Deut.25.10|10]] And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed.

10: 

[[Deut.25.11|11]] When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets:

11: 

[[Deut.25.12|12]] Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity \[her\].

12:
