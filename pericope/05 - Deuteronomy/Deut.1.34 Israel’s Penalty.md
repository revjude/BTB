[[Deut.1|Deuteronomy 1:34 - Deuteronomy 1:40]]
*Israel’s Penalty*

[[Deut.1.34|34]] And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,

34: 

[[Deut.1.35|35]] Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,

35: 

[[Deut.1.36|36]] Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.

36: 

[[Deut.1.37|37]] Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.

37: 

[[Deut.1.38|38]] \[But\] Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.

38: 

[[Deut.1.39|39]] Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.

39: 

[[Deut.1.40|40]] But \[as for\] you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.

40:
