[[Deut.10|Deuteronomy 10:1 - Deuteronomy 10:11]]
*New Stone Tablets*

[[Deut.10.1|1]] At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.

1: 

[[Deut.10.2|2]] And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.

2: 

[[Deut.10.3|3]] And I made an ark \[of\] shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.

3: 

[[Deut.10.4|4]] And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me.

4: 

[[Deut.10.5|5]] And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.

5: 

[[Deut.10.6|6]] And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his stead.

6: 

[[Deut.10.7|7]] From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.

7: 

[[Deut.10.8|8]] At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.

8: 

[[Deut.10.9|9]] Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD \[is\] his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him.

9: 

[[Deut.10.10|10]] And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, \[and\] the LORD would not destroy thee.

10: 

[[Deut.10.11|11]] And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take \[thy\] journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.

11:
