[[Deut.11|Deuteronomy 11:1 - Deuteronomy 11:7]]
*Obedience and Discipline*

[[Deut.11.1|1]] Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.

1: 

[[Deut.11.2|2]] And know ye this day: for \[I speak\] not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,

2: 

[[Deut.11.3|3]] And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;

3: 

[[Deut.11.4|4]] And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and \[how\] the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day;

4: 

[[Deut.11.5|5]] And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place;

5: 

[[Deut.11.6|6]] And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that \[was\] in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:

6: 

[[Deut.11.7|7]] But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.

7:
