[[Deut.3|Deuteronomy 3:1 - Deuteronomy 3:11]]
*The Defeat of Og*

[[Deut.3.1|1]] Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.

1: 

[[Deut.3.2|2]] And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

2: 

[[Deut.3.3|3]] So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.

3: 

[[Deut.3.4|4]] And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

4: 

[[Deut.3.5|5]] All these cities \[were\] fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.

5: 

[[Deut.3.6|6]] And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.

6: 

[[Deut.3.7|7]] But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.

7: 

[[Deut.3.8|8]] And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that \[was\] on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;

8: 

[[Deut.3.9|9]] (\[Which\] Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)

9: 

[[Deut.3.10|10]] All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

10: 

[[Deut.3.11|11]] For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead \[was\] a bedstead of iron; \[is\] it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits \[was\] the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.

11:
