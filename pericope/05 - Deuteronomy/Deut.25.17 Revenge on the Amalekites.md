[[Deut.25|Deuteronomy 25:17 - Deuteronomy 25:19]]
*Revenge on the Amalekites*

[[Deut.25.17|17]] Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt;

17: 

[[Deut.25.18|18]] How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, \[even\] all \[that were\] feeble behind thee, when thou \[wast\] faint and weary; and he feared not God.

18: 

[[Deut.25.19|19]] Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee \[for\] an inheritance to possess it, \[that\] thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget \[it\].

19:
