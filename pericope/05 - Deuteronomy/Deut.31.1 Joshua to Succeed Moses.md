[[Deut.31|Deuteronomy 31:1 - Deuteronomy 31:8]]
*Joshua to Succeed Moses*

[[Deut.31.1|1]] And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.

1: 

[[Deut.31.2|2]] And he said unto them, I \[am\] an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.

2: 

[[Deut.31.3|3]] The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, \[and\] he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: \[and\] Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said.

3: 

[[Deut.31.4|4]] And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.

4: 

[[Deut.31.5|5]] And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you.

5: 

[[Deut.31.6|6]] Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he \[it is\] that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

6: 

[[Deut.31.7|7]] And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.

7: 

[[Deut.31.8|8]] And the LORD, he \[it is\] that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.

8:
