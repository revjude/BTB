[[Deut.12|Deuteronomy 12:29 - Deuteronomy 12:32]]
*A Warning against Idolatry*

[[Deut.12.29|29]] When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land;

29: 

[[Deut.12.30|30]] Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.

30: 

[[Deut.12.31|31]] Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.

31: 

[[Deut.12.32|32]] What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.

32:
