[[Deut.13|Deuteronomy 13:12 - Deuteronomy 13:18]]
*Idolatrous Cities to Be Destroyed*

[[Deut.13.12|12]] If thou shalt hear \[say\] in one of thy cities, which the LORD thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying,

12: 

[[Deut.13.13|13]] \[Certain\] men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;

13: 

[[Deut.13.14|14]] Then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, \[if it be\] truth, \[and\] the thing certain, \[that\] such abomination is wrought among you;

14: 

[[Deut.13.15|15]] Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that \[is\] therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.

15: 

[[Deut.13.16|16]] And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again.

16: 

[[Deut.13.17|17]] And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;

17: 

[[Deut.13.18|18]] When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do \[that which is\] right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.

18:
