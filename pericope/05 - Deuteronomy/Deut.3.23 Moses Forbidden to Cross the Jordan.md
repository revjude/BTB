[[Deut.3|Deuteronomy 3:23 - Deuteronomy 3:29]]
*Moses Forbidden to Cross the Jordan*

[[Deut.3.23|23]] And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,

23: 

[[Deut.3.24|24]] O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God \[is there\] in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?

24: 

[[Deut.3.25|25]] I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that \[is\] beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.

25: 

[[Deut.3.26|26]] But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.

26: 

[[Deut.3.27|27]] Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold \[it\] with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.

27: 

[[Deut.3.28|28]] But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.

28: 

[[Deut.3.29|29]] So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.

29:
