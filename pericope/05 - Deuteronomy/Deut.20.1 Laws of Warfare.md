[[Deut.20|Deuteronomy 20:1 - Deuteronomy 20:20]]
*Laws of Warfare*

[[Deut.20.1|1]] When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, \[and\] a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the LORD thy God \[is\] with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

1: 

[[Deut.20.2|2]] And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,

2: 

[[Deut.20.3|3]] And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;

3: 

[[Deut.20.4|4]] For the LORD your God \[is\] he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.

4: 

[[Deut.20.5|5]] And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man \[is there\] that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.

5: 

[[Deut.20.6|6]] And what man \[is he\] that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not \[yet\] eaten of it? let him \[also\] go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.

6: 

[[Deut.20.7|7]] And what man \[is there\] that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.

7: 

[[Deut.20.8|8]] And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man \[is there that is\] fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren’s heart faint as well as his heart.

8: 

[[Deut.20.9|9]] And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.

9: 

[[Deut.20.10|10]] When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it.

10: 

[[Deut.20.11|11]] And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, \[that\] all the people \[that is\] found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.

11: 

[[Deut.20.12|12]] And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:

12: 

[[Deut.20.13|13]] And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:

13: 

[[Deut.20.14|14]] But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, \[even\] all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.

14: 

[[Deut.20.15|15]] Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities \[which are\] very far off from thee, which \[are\] not of the cities of these nations.

15: 

[[Deut.20.16|16]] But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth give thee \[for\] an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth:

16: 

[[Deut.20.17|17]] But thou shalt utterly destroy them; \[namely\], the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:

17: 

[[Deut.20.18|18]] That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the LORD your God.

18: 

[[Deut.20.19|19]] When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field \[is\] man’s \[life\]) to employ \[them\] in the siege:

19: 

[[Deut.20.20|20]] Only the trees which thou knowest that they \[be\] not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued.

20:
