[[Deut.1|Deuteronomy 1:41 - Deuteronomy 1:46]]
*The Defeat at Hormah*

[[Deut.1.41|41]] Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.

41: 

[[Deut.1.42|42]] And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I \[am\] not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.

42: 

[[Deut.1.43|43]] So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.

43: 

[[Deut.1.44|44]] And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, \[even\] unto Hormah.

44: 

[[Deut.1.45|45]] And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.

45: 

[[Deut.1.46|46]] So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode \[there\].

46:
