[[Deut.7|Deuteronomy 7:1 - Deuteronomy 7:11]]
*Drive Out the Nations*

[[Deut.7.1|1]] When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;

1: 

[[Deut.7.2|2]] And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, \[and\] utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:

2: 

[[Deut.7.3|3]] Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.

3: 

[[Deut.7.4|4]] For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.

4: 

[[Deut.7.5|5]] But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.

5: 

[[Deut.7.6|6]] For thou \[art\] an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that \[are\] upon the face of the earth.

6: 

[[Deut.7.7|7]] The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye \[were\] the fewest of all people:

7: 

[[Deut.7.8|8]] But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

8: 

[[Deut.7.9|9]] Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he \[is\] God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;

9: 

[[Deut.7.10|10]] And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.

10: 

[[Deut.7.11|11]] Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.

11:
