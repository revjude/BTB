[[Deut.21|Deuteronomy 21:15 - Deuteronomy 21:17]]
*Inheritance Rights of the Firstborn*

[[Deut.21.15|15]] If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, \[both\] the beloved and the hated; and \[if\] the firstborn son be hers that was hated:

15: 

[[Deut.21.16|16]] Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit \[that\] which he hath, \[that\] he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, \[which is indeed\] the firstborn:

16: 

[[Deut.21.17|17]] But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated \[for\] the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he \[is\] the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn \[is\] his.

17:
