[[Deut.21|Deuteronomy 21:1 - Deuteronomy 21:9]]
*Atonement for an Unsolved Murder*

[[Deut.21.1|1]] If \[one\] be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, \[and\] it be not known who hath slain him:

1: 

[[Deut.21.2|2]] Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which \[are\] round about him that is slain:

2: 

[[Deut.21.3|3]] And it shall be, \[that\] the city \[which is\] next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not been wrought with, \[and\] which hath not drawn in the yoke;

3: 

[[Deut.21.4|4]] And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer’s neck there in the valley:

4: 

[[Deut.21.5|5]] And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be \[tried\]:

5: 

[[Deut.21.6|6]] And all the elders of that city, \[that are\] next unto the slain \[man\], shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley:

6: 

[[Deut.21.7|7]] And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen \[it\].

7: 

[[Deut.21.8|8]] Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel’s charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.

8: 

[[Deut.21.9|9]] So shalt thou put away the \[guilt of\] innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do \[that which is\] right in the sight of the LORD.

9:
