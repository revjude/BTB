[[Deut.17|Deuteronomy 17:8 - Deuteronomy 17:13]]
*Courts of Law*

[[Deut.17.8|8]] If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, \[being\] matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and get thee up into the place which the LORD thy God shall choose;

8: 

[[Deut.17.9|9]] And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days, and inquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment:

9: 

[[Deut.17.10|10]] And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall shew thee; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee:

10: 

[[Deut.17.11|11]] According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee, \[to\] the right hand, nor \[to\] the left.

11: 

[[Deut.17.12|12]] And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.

12: 

[[Deut.17.13|13]] And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.

13:
