[[Deut.16|Deuteronomy 16:1 - Deuteronomy 16:8]]
*Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread*

[[Deut.16.1|1]] Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night.

1: 

[[Deut.16.2|2]] Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there.

2: 

[[Deut.16.3|3]] Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, \[even\] the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.

3: 

[[Deut.16.4|4]] And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days; neither shall there \[any thing\] of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.

4: 

[[Deut.16.5|5]] Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee:

5: 

[[Deut.16.6|6]] But at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt.

6: 

[[Deut.16.7|7]] And thou shalt roast and eat \[it\] in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents.

7: 

[[Deut.16.8|8]] Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day \[shall be\] a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work \[therein\].

8:
