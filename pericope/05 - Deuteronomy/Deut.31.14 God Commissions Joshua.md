[[Deut.31|Deuteronomy 31:14 - Deuteronomy 31:23]]
*God Commissions Joshua*

[[Deut.31.14|14]] And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.

14: 

[[Deut.31.15|15]] And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.

15: 

[[Deut.31.16|16]] And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go \[to be\] among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.

16: 

[[Deut.31.17|17]] Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God \[is\] not among us?

17: 

[[Deut.31.18|18]] And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.

18: 

[[Deut.31.19|19]] Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.

19: 

[[Deut.31.20|20]] For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.

20: 

[[Deut.31.21|21]] And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.

21: 

[[Deut.31.22|22]] Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.

22: 

[[Deut.31.23|23]] And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.

23:
