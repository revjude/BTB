[[Deut.14|Deuteronomy 14:1 - Deuteronomy 14:21]]
*Clean and Unclean Animals*

[[Deut.14.1|1]] Ye \[are\] the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.

1: 

[[Deut.14.2|2]] For thou \[art\] an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the nations that \[are\] upon the earth.

2: 

[[Deut.14.3|3]] Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.

3: 

[[Deut.14.4|4]] These \[are\] the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,

4: 

[[Deut.14.5|5]] The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.

5: 

[[Deut.14.6|6]] And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into two claws, \[and\] cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall eat.

6: 

[[Deut.14.7|7]] Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; \[as\] the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; \[therefore\] they \[are\] unclean unto you.

7: 

[[Deut.14.8|8]] And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it \[is\] unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase.

8: 

[[Deut.14.9|9]] These ye shall eat of all that \[are\] in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat:

9: 

[[Deut.14.10|10]] And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it \[is\] unclean unto you.

10: 

[[Deut.14.11|11]] \[Of\] all clean birds ye shall eat.

11: 

[[Deut.14.12|12]] But these \[are they\] of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,

12: 

[[Deut.14.13|13]] And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,

13: 

[[Deut.14.14|14]] And every raven after his kind,

14: 

[[Deut.14.15|15]] And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,

15: 

[[Deut.14.16|16]] The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,

16: 

[[Deut.14.17|17]] And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant,

17: 

[[Deut.14.18|18]] And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.

18: 

[[Deut.14.19|19]] And every creeping thing that flieth \[is\] unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten.

19: 

[[Deut.14.20|20]] \[But of\] all clean fowls ye may eat.

20: 

[[Deut.14.21|21]] Ye shall not eat \[of\] any thing that dieth of itself: thou shalt give it unto the stranger that \[is\] in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou \[art\] an holy people unto the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother’s milk.

21:
