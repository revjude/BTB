[[Deut.23|Deuteronomy 23:1 - Deuteronomy 23:8]]
*Exclusion from the Congregation*

[[Deut.23.1|1]] He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.

1: 

[[Deut.23.2|2]] A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD.

2: 

[[Deut.23.3|3]] An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever:

3: 

[[Deut.23.4|4]] Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee.

4: 

[[Deut.23.5|5]] Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because the LORD thy God loved thee.

5: 

[[Deut.23.6|6]] Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever.

6: 

[[Deut.23.7|7]] Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he \[is\] thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land.

7: 

[[Deut.23.8|8]] The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the LORD in their third generation.

8:
