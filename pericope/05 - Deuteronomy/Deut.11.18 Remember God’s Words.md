[[Deut.11|Deuteronomy 11:18 - Deuteronomy 11:25]]
*Remember God’s Words*

[[Deut.11.18|18]] Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.

18: 

[[Deut.11.19|19]] And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

19: 

[[Deut.11.20|20]] And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates:

20: 

[[Deut.11.21|21]] That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.

21: 

[[Deut.11.22|22]] For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;

22: 

[[Deut.11.23|23]] Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.

23: 

[[Deut.11.24|24]] Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.

24: 

[[Deut.11.25|25]] There shall no man be able to stand before you: \[for\] the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.

25:
