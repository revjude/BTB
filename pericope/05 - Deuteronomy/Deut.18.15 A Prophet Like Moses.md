[[Deut.18|Deuteronomy 18:15 - Deuteronomy 18:22]]
*A Prophet Like Moses*

[[Deut.18.15|15]] The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;

15: 

[[Deut.18.16|16]] According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.

16: 

[[Deut.18.17|17]] And the LORD said unto me, They have well \[spoken that\] which they have spoken.

17: 

[[Deut.18.18|18]] I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.

18: 

[[Deut.18.19|19]] And it shall come to pass, \[that\] whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require \[it\] of him.

19: 

[[Deut.18.20|20]] But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.

20: 

[[Deut.18.21|21]] And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD hath not spoken?

21: 

[[Deut.18.22|22]] When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that \[is\] the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, \[but\] the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.

22:
