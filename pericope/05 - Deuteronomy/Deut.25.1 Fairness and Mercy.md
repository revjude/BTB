[[Deut.25|Deuteronomy 25:1 - Deuteronomy 25:4]]
*Fairness and Mercy*

[[Deut.25.1|1]] If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, that \[the judges\] may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked.

1: 

[[Deut.25.2|2]] And it shall be, if the wicked man \[be\] worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number.

2: 

[[Deut.25.3|3]] Forty stripes he may give him, \[and\] not exceed: lest, \[if\] he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should seem vile unto thee.

3: 

[[Deut.25.4|4]] Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out \[the corn\].

4:
