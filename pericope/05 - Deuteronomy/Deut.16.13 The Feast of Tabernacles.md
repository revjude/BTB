[[Deut.16|Deuteronomy 16:13 - Deuteronomy 16:17]]
*The Feast of Tabernacles*

[[Deut.16.13|13]] Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine:

13: 

[[Deut.16.14|14]] And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that \[are\] within thy gates.

14: 

[[Deut.16.15|15]] Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.

15: 

[[Deut.16.16|16]] Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty:

16: 

[[Deut.16.17|17]] Every man \[shall give\] as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee.

17:
