[[Deut.30|Deuteronomy 30:1 - Deuteronomy 30:10]]
*The Promise of Restoration*

[[Deut.30.1|1]] And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call \[them\] to mind among all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee,

1: 

[[Deut.30.2|2]] And shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul;

2: 

[[Deut.30.3|3]] That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.

3: 

[[Deut.30.4|4]] If \[any\] of thine be driven out unto the outmost \[parts\] of heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:

4: 

[[Deut.30.5|5]] And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.

5: 

[[Deut.30.6|6]] And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.

6: 

[[Deut.30.7|7]] And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.

7: 

[[Deut.30.8|8]] And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day.

8: 

[[Deut.30.9|9]] And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers:

9: 

[[Deut.30.10|10]] If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, \[and\] if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.

10:
