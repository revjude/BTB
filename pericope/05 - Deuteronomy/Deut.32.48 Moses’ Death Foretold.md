[[Deut.32|Deuteronomy 32:48 - Deuteronomy 32:52]]
*Moses’ Death Foretold*

[[Deut.32.48|48]] And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,

48: 

[[Deut.32.49|49]] Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, \[unto\] mount Nebo, which \[is\] in the land of Moab, that \[is\] over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:

49: 

[[Deut.32.50|50]] And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:

50: 

[[Deut.32.51|51]] Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.

51: 

[[Deut.32.52|52]] Yet thou shalt see the land before \[thee\]; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.

52:
