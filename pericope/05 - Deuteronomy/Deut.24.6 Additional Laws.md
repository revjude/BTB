[[Deut.24|Deuteronomy 24:6 - Deuteronomy 24:22]]
*Additional Laws*

[[Deut.24.6|6]] No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he taketh \[a man’s\] life to pledge.

6: 

[[Deut.24.7|7]] If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you.

7: 

[[Deut.24.8|8]] Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, \[so\] ye shall observe to do.

8: 

[[Deut.24.9|9]] Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that ye were come forth out of Egypt.

9: 

[[Deut.24.10|10]] When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge.

10: 

[[Deut.24.11|11]] Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.

11: 

[[Deut.24.12|12]] And if the man \[be\] poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:

12: 

[[Deut.24.13|13]] In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God.

13: 

[[Deut.24.14|14]] Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant \[that is\] poor and needy, \[whether he be\] of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that \[are\] in thy land within thy gates:

14: 

[[Deut.24.15|15]] At his day thou shalt give \[him\] his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he \[is\] poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto thee.

15: 

[[Deut.24.16|16]] The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.

16: 

[[Deut.24.17|17]] Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, \[nor\] of the fatherless; nor take a widow’s raiment to pledge:

17: 

[[Deut.24.18|18]] But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.

18: 

[[Deut.24.19|19]] When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands.

19: 

[[Deut.24.20|20]] When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.

20: 

[[Deut.24.21|21]] When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean \[it\] afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.

21: 

[[Deut.24.22|22]] And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.

22:
