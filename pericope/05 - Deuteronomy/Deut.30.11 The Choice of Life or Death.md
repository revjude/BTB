[[Deut.30|Deuteronomy 30:11 - Deuteronomy 30:20]]
*The Choice of Life or Death*

[[Deut.30.11|11]] For this commandment which I command thee this day, it \[is\] not hidden from thee, neither \[is\] it far off.

11: 

[[Deut.30.12|12]] It \[is\] not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?

12: 

[[Deut.30.13|13]] Neither \[is\] it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?

13: 

[[Deut.30.14|14]] But the word \[is\] very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.

14: 

[[Deut.30.15|15]] See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;

15: 

[[Deut.30.16|16]] In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.

16: 

[[Deut.30.17|17]] But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;

17: 

[[Deut.30.18|18]] I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, \[and that\] ye shall not prolong \[your\] days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.

18: 

[[Deut.30.19|19]] I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, \[that\] I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:

19: 

[[Deut.30.20|20]] That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, \[and\] that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he \[is\] thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

20:
