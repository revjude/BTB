[[Deut.10|Deuteronomy 10:12 - Deuteronomy 10:22]]
*A Call to Obedience*

[[Deut.10.12|12]] And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,

12: 

[[Deut.10.13|13]] To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?

13: 

[[Deut.10.14|14]] Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens \[is\] the LORD’S thy God, the earth \[also\], with all that therein \[is\].

14: 

[[Deut.10.15|15]] Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, \[even\] you above all people, as \[it is\] this day.

15: 

[[Deut.10.16|16]] Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.

16: 

[[Deut.10.17|17]] For the LORD your God \[is\] God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward:

17: 

[[Deut.10.18|18]] He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.

18: 

[[Deut.10.19|19]] Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

19: 

[[Deut.10.20|20]] Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.

20: 

[[Deut.10.21|21]] He \[is\] thy praise, and he \[is\] thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.

21: 

[[Deut.10.22|22]] Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.

22:
