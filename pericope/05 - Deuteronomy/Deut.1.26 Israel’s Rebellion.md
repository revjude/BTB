[[Deut.1|Deuteronomy 1:26 - Deuteronomy 1:33]]
*Israel’s Rebellion*

[[Deut.1.26|26]] Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:

26: 

[[Deut.1.27|27]] And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.

27: 

[[Deut.1.28|28]] Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people \[is\] greater and taller than we; the cities \[are\] great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.

28: 

[[Deut.1.29|29]] Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.

29: 

[[Deut.1.30|30]] The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;

30: 

[[Deut.1.31|31]] And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.

31: 

[[Deut.1.32|32]] Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,

32: 

[[Deut.1.33|33]] Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents \[in\], in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.

33:
