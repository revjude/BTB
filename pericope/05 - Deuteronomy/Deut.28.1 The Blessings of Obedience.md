[[Deut.28|Deuteronomy 28:1 - Deuteronomy 28:14]]
*The Blessings of Obedience*

[[Deut.28.1|1]] And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe \[and\] to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth:

1: 

[[Deut.28.2|2]] And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God.

2: 

[[Deut.28.3|3]] Blessed \[shalt\] thou \[be\] in the city, and blessed \[shalt\] thou \[be\] in the field.

3: 

[[Deut.28.4|4]] Blessed \[shall be\] the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.

4: 

[[Deut.28.5|5]] Blessed \[shall be\] thy basket and thy store.

5: 

[[Deut.28.6|6]] Blessed \[shalt\] thou \[be\] when thou comest in, and blessed \[shalt\] thou \[be\] when thou goest out.

6: 

[[Deut.28.7|7]] The LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face: they shall come out against thee one way, and flee before thee seven ways.

7: 

[[Deut.28.8|8]] The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses, and in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

8: 

[[Deut.28.9|9]] The LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself, as he hath sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, and walk in his ways.

9: 

[[Deut.28.10|10]] And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee.

10: 

[[Deut.28.11|11]] And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give thee.

11: 

[[Deut.28.12|12]] The LORD shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all the work of thine hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not borrow.

12: 

[[Deut.28.13|13]] And the LORD shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe and to do \[them\]:

13: 

[[Deut.28.14|14]] And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day, \[to\] the right hand, or \[to\] the left, to go after other gods to serve them.

14:
