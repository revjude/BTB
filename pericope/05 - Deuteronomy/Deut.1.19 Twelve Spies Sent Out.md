[[Deut.1|Deuteronomy 1:19 - Deuteronomy 1:25]]
*Twelve Spies Sent Out*

[[Deut.1.19|19]] And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.

19: 

[[Deut.1.20|20]] And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.

20: 

[[Deut.1.21|21]] Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up \[and\] possess \[it\], as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.

21: 

[[Deut.1.22|22]] And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.

22: 

[[Deut.1.23|23]] And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:

23: 

[[Deut.1.24|24]] And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.

24: 

[[Deut.1.25|25]] And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought \[it\] down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, \[It is\] a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.

25:
