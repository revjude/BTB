[[Deut.2|Deuteronomy 2:24 - Deuteronomy 2:37]]
*The Defeat of Sihon*

[[Deut.2.24|24]] Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess \[it\], and contend with him in battle.

24: 

[[Deut.2.25|25]] This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations \[that are\] under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.

25: 

[[Deut.2.26|26]] And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,

26: 

[[Deut.2.27|27]] Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.

27: 

[[Deut.2.28|28]] Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;

28: 

[[Deut.2.29|29]] (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.

29: 

[[Deut.2.30|30]] But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as \[appeareth\] this day.

30: 

[[Deut.2.31|31]] And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.

31: 

[[Deut.2.32|32]] Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.

32: 

[[Deut.2.33|33]] And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.

33: 

[[Deut.2.34|34]] And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:

34: 

[[Deut.2.35|35]] Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.

35: 

[[Deut.2.36|36]] From Aroer, which \[is\] by the brink of the river of Arnon, and \[from\] the city that \[is\] by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:

36: 

[[Deut.2.37|37]] Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, \[nor\] unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.

37:
