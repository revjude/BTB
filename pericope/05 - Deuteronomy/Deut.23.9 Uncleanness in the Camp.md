[[Deut.23|Deuteronomy 23:9 - Deuteronomy 23:14]]
*Uncleanness in the Camp*

[[Deut.23.9|9]] When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing.

9: 

[[Deut.23.10|10]] If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:

10: 

[[Deut.23.11|11]] But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash \[himself\] with water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp \[again\].

11: 

[[Deut.23.12|12]] Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad:

12: 

[[Deut.23.13|13]] And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee:

13: 

[[Deut.23.14|14]] For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee.

14:
