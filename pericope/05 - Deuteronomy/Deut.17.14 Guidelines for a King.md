[[Deut.17|Deuteronomy 17:14 - Deuteronomy 17:20]]
*Guidelines for a King*

[[Deut.17.14|14]] When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that \[are\] about me;

14: 

[[Deut.17.15|15]] Thou shalt in any wise set \[him\] king over thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose: \[one\] from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which \[is\] not thy brother.

15: 

[[Deut.17.16|16]] But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.

16: 

[[Deut.17.17|17]] Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.

17: 

[[Deut.17.18|18]] And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of \[that which is\] before the priests the Levites:

18: 

[[Deut.17.19|19]] And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them:

19: 

[[Deut.17.20|20]] That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, \[to\] the right hand, or \[to\] the left: to the end that he may prolong \[his\] days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.

20:
