[[Deut.21|Deuteronomy 21:22 - Deuteronomy 21:23]]
*Cursed Is Anyone Hung on a Tree*

[[Deut.21.22|22]] And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:

22: 

[[Deut.21.23|23]] His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged \[is\] accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee \[for\] an inheritance.

23:
