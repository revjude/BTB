[[Deut.31|Deuteronomy 31:24 - Deuteronomy 31:29]]
*The Law Placed in the Ark*

[[Deut.31.24|24]] And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,

24: 

[[Deut.31.25|25]] That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,

25: 

[[Deut.31.26|26]] Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.

26: 

[[Deut.31.27|27]] For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?

27: 

[[Deut.31.28|28]] Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.

28: 

[[Deut.31.29|29]] For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt \[yourselves\], and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.

29:
