[[Deut.24|Deuteronomy 24:1 - Deuteronomy 24:5]]
*Marriage and Divorce Laws*

[[Deut.24.1|1]] When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give \[it\] in her hand, and send her out of his house.

1: 

[[Deut.24.2|2]] And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man’s \[wife\].

2: 

[[Deut.24.3|3]] And \[if\] the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth \[it\] in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her \[to be\] his wife;

3: 

[[Deut.24.4|4]] Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that \[is\] abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee \[for\] an inheritance.

4: 

[[Deut.24.5|5]] When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: \[but\] he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.

5:
