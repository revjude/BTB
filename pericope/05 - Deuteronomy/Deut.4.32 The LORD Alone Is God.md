[[Deut.4|Deuteronomy 4:32 - Deuteronomy 4:40]]
*The LORD Alone Is God*

[[Deut.4.32|32]] For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and \[ask\] from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been \[any such thing\] as this great thing \[is\], or hath been heard like it?

32: 

[[Deut.4.33|33]] Did \[ever\] people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?

33: 

[[Deut.4.34|34]] Or hath God assayed to go \[and\] take him a nation from the midst of \[another\] nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?

34: 

[[Deut.4.35|35]] Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he \[is\] God; \[there is\] none else beside him.

35: 

[[Deut.4.36|36]] Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.

36: 

[[Deut.4.37|37]] And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;

37: 

[[Deut.4.38|38]] To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou \[art\], to bring thee in, to give thee their land \[for\] an inheritance, as \[it is\] this day.

38: 

[[Deut.4.39|39]] Know therefore this day, and consider \[it\] in thine heart, that the LORD he \[is\] God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: \[there is\] none else.

39: 

[[Deut.4.40|40]] Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong \[thy\] days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.

40:
