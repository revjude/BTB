[[Deut.1|Deuteronomy 1:9 - Deuteronomy 1:18]]
*Moses Appoints Leaders*

[[Deut.1.9|9]] And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:

9: 

[[Deut.1.10|10]] The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye \[are\] this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.

10: 

[[Deut.1.11|11]] (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye \[are\], and bless you, as he hath promised you!)

11: 

[[Deut.1.12|12]] How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?

12: 

[[Deut.1.13|13]] Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.

13: 

[[Deut.1.14|14]] And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken \[is\] good \[for us\] to do.

14: 

[[Deut.1.15|15]] So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.

15: 

[[Deut.1.16|16]] And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear \[the causes\] between your brethren, and judge righteously between \[every\] man and his brother, and the stranger \[that is\] with him.

16: 

[[Deut.1.17|17]] Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; \[but\] ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment \[is\] God’s: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring \[it\] unto me, and I will hear it.

17: 

[[Deut.1.18|18]] And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.

18:
