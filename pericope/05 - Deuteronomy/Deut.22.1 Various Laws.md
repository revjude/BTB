[[Deut.22|Deuteronomy 22:1 - Deuteronomy 22:12]]
*Various Laws*

[[Deut.22.1|1]] Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother.

1: 

[[Deut.22.2|2]] And if thy brother \[be\] not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again.

2: 

[[Deut.22.3|3]] In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother’s, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself.

3: 

[[Deut.22.4|4]] Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift \[them\] up again.

4: 

[[Deut.22.5|5]] The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment: for all that do so \[are\] abomination unto the LORD thy God.

5: 

[[Deut.22.6|6]] If a bird’s nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree, or on the ground, \[whether they be\] young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young:

6: 

[[Deut.22.7|7]] \[But\] thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and \[that\] thou mayest prolong \[thy\] days.

7: 

[[Deut.22.8|8]] When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any man fall from thence.

8: 

[[Deut.22.9|9]] Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be defiled.

9: 

[[Deut.22.10|10]] Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.

10: 

[[Deut.22.11|11]] Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, \[as\] of woollen and linen together.

11: 

[[Deut.22.12|12]] Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest \[thyself\].
