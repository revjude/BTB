[[Deut.15|Deuteronomy 15:12 - Deuteronomy 15:18]]
*Hebrew Servants*

[[Deut.15.12|12]] \[And\] if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee.

12: 

[[Deut.15.13|13]] And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty:

13: 

[[Deut.15.14|14]] Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: \[of that\] wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.

14: 

[[Deut.15.15|15]] And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to day.

15: 

[[Deut.15.16|16]] And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee;

16: 

[[Deut.15.17|17]] Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust \[it\] through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.

17: 

[[Deut.15.18|18]] It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant \[to thee\], in serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest.

18:
