*Sorcery Forbidden*

[[Deut.18.9|9]] When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.

9: 

[[Deut.18.10|10]] There shall not be found among you \[any one\] that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, \[or\] that useth divination, \[or\] an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch,

10: 

[[Deut.18.11|11]] Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.

11: 

[[Deut.18.12|12]] For all that do these things \[are\] an abomination unto the LORD: and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee.

12: 

[[Deut.18.13|13]] Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.

13: 

[[Deut.18.14|14]] For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so \[to do\].

14:
