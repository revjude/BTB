[[Deut.4|Deuteronomy 4:1 - Deuteronomy 4:14]]
*An Exhortation to Obedience*

[[Deut.4.1|1]] Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do \[them\], that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.

1: 

[[Deut.4.2|2]] Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish \[ought\] from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.

2: 

[[Deut.4.3|3]] Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.

3: 

[[Deut.4.4|4]] But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God \[are\] alive every one of you this day.

4: 

[[Deut.4.5|5]] Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.

5: 

[[Deut.4.6|6]] Keep therefore and do \[them\]; for this \[is\] your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation \[is\] a wise and understanding people.

6: 

[[Deut.4.7|7]] For what nation \[is there so\] great, who \[hath\] God \[so\] nigh unto them, as the LORD our God \[is\] in all \[things that\] we call upon him \[for\]?

7: 

[[Deut.4.8|8]] And what nation \[is there so\] great, that hath statutes and judgments \[so\] righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?

8: 

[[Deut.4.9|9]] Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons’ sons;

9: 

[[Deut.4.10|10]] \[Specially\] the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and \[that\] they may teach their children.

10: 

[[Deut.4.11|11]] And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.

11: 

[[Deut.4.12|12]] And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only \[ye heard\] a voice.

12: 

[[Deut.4.13|13]] And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, \[even\] ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.

13: 

[[Deut.4.14|14]] And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.

14:
