*The Reading of the Law*

[[Deut.31.9|9]] And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel.

9: 

[[Deut.31.10|10]] And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of \[every\] seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,

10: 

[[Deut.31.11|11]] When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.

11: 

[[Deut.31.12|12]] Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that \[is\] within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law:

12: 

[[Deut.31.13|13]] And \[that\] their children, which have not known \[any thing\], may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

13:
