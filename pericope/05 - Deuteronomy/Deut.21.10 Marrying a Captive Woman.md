[[Deut.21|Deuteronomy 21:10 - Deuteronomy 21:14]]
*Marrying a Captive Woman*

[[Deut.21.10|10]] When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive,

10: 

[[Deut.21.11|11]] And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;

11: 

[[Deut.21.12|12]] Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;

12: 

[[Deut.21.13|13]] And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.

13: 

[[Deut.21.14|14]] And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.

14:
