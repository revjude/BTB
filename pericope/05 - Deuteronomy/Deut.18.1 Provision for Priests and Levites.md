[[Deut.18|Deuteronomy 18:1 - Deuteronomy 18:8]]
*Provision for Priests and Levites*

[[Deut.18.1|1]] The priests the Levites, \[and\] all the tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance.

1: 

[[Deut.18.2|2]] Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the LORD \[is\] their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.

2: 

[[Deut.18.3|3]] And this shall be the priest’s due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether \[it be\] ox or sheep; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.

3: 

[[Deut.18.4|4]] The firstfruit \[also\] of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.

4: 

[[Deut.18.5|5]] For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever.

5: 

[[Deut.18.6|6]] And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the LORD shall choose;

6: 

[[Deut.18.7|7]] Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites \[do\], which stand there before the LORD.

7: 

[[Deut.18.8|8]] They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.

8:
