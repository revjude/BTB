[[Deut.9|Deuteronomy 9:1 - Deuteronomy 9:6]]
*Assurance of Victory*

[[Deut.9.1|1]] Hear, O Israel: Thou \[art\] to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,

1: 

[[Deut.9.2|2]] A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and \[of whom\] thou hast heard \[say\], Who can stand before the children of Anak!

2: 

[[Deut.9.3|3]] Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God \[is\] he which goeth over before thee; \[as\] a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.

3: 

[[Deut.9.4|4]] Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.

4: 

[[Deut.9.5|5]] Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

5: 

[[Deut.9.6|6]] Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou \[art\] a stiffnecked people.

6:
