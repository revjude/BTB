[[Deut.11|Deuteronomy 11:26 - Deuteronomy 11:32]]
*A Blessing and a Curse*

[[Deut.11.26|26]] Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;

26: 

[[Deut.11.27|27]] A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day:

27: 

[[Deut.11.28|28]] And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.

28: 

[[Deut.11.29|29]] And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.

29: 

[[Deut.11.30|30]] \[Are\] they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?

30: 

[[Deut.11.31|31]] For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.

31: 

[[Deut.11.32|32]] And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.

32:
