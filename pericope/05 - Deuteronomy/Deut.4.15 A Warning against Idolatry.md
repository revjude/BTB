[[Deut.4|Deuteronomy 4:15 - Deuteronomy 4:31]]
*A Warning against Idolatry*

[[Deut.4.15|15]] Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day \[that\] the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:

15: 

[[Deut.4.16|16]] Lest ye corrupt \[yourselves\], and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,

16: 

[[Deut.4.17|17]] The likeness of any beast that \[is\] on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,

17: 

[[Deut.4.18|18]] The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that \[is\] in the waters beneath the earth:

18: 

[[Deut.4.19|19]] And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, \[even\] all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.

19: 

[[Deut.4.20|20]] But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, \[even\] out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as \[ye are\] this day.

20: 

[[Deut.4.21|21]] Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee \[for\] an inheritance:

21: 

[[Deut.4.22|22]] But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.

22: 

[[Deut.4.23|23]] Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, \[or\] the likeness of any \[thing\], which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.

23: 

[[Deut.4.24|24]] For the LORD thy God \[is\] a consuming fire, \[even\] a jealous God.

24: 

[[Deut.4.25|25]] When thou shalt beget children, and children’s children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt \[yourselves\], and make a graven image, \[or\] the likeness of any \[thing\], and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:

25: 

[[Deut.4.26|26]] I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong \[your\] days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.

26: 

[[Deut.4.27|27]] And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.

27: 

[[Deut.4.28|28]] And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.

28: 

[[Deut.4.29|29]] But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find \[him\], if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.

29: 

[[Deut.4.30|30]] When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, \[even\] in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;

30: 

[[Deut.4.31|31]] (For the LORD thy God \[is\] a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.

31:
