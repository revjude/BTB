[[Lam.5|Lamentations 5:1 - Lamentations 5:22]]
*A Prayer for Restoration*

[[Lam.5.1|1]] Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach.

1: 

[[Lam.5.2|2]] Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.

2: 

[[Lam.5.3|3]] We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers \[are\] as widows.

3: 

[[Lam.5.4|4]] We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.

4: 

[[Lam.5.5|5]] Our necks \[are\] under persecution: we labour, \[and\] have no rest.

5: 

[[Lam.5.6|6]] We have given the hand \[to\] the Egyptians, \[and to\] the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.

6: 

[[Lam.5.7|7]] Our fathers have sinned, \[and are\] not; and we have borne their iniquities.

7: 

[[Lam.5.8|8]] Servants have ruled over us: \[there is\] none that doth deliver \[us\] out of their hand.

8: 

[[Lam.5.9|9]] We gat our bread with \[the peril of\] our lives because of the sword of the wilderness.

9: 

[[Lam.5.10|10]] Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.

10: 

[[Lam.5.11|11]] They ravished the women in Zion, \[and\] the maids in the cities of Judah.

11: 

[[Lam.5.12|12]] Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured.

12: 

[[Lam.5.13|13]] They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.

13: 

[[Lam.5.14|14]] The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick.

14: 

[[Lam.5.15|15]] The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.

15: 

[[Lam.5.16|16]] The crown is fallen \[from\] our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned!

16: 

[[Lam.5.17|17]] For this our heart is faint; for these \[things\] our eyes are dim.

17: 

[[Lam.5.18|18]] Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it.

18: 

[[Lam.5.19|19]] Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation.

19: 

[[Lam.5.20|20]] Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, \[and\] forsake us so long time?

20: 

[[Lam.5.21|21]] Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.

21: 

[[Lam.5.22|22]] But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.

22:
