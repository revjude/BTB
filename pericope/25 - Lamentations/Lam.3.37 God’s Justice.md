[[Lam.3|Lamentations 3:37 - Lamentations 3:66]]
*God’s Justice*

[[Lam.3.37|37]] Who \[is\] he \[that\] saith, and it cometh to pass, \[when\] the Lord commandeth \[it\] not?

37: 

[[Lam.3.38|38]] Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?

38: 

[[Lam.3.39|39]] Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?

39: 

[[Lam.3.40|40]] Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.

40: 

[[Lam.3.41|41]] Let us lift up our heart with \[our\] hands unto God in the heavens.

41: 

[[Lam.3.42|42]] We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.

42: 

[[Lam.3.43|43]] Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.

43: 

[[Lam.3.44|44]] Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that \[our\] prayer should not pass through.

44: 

[[Lam.3.45|45]] Thou hast made us \[as\] the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.

45: 

[[Lam.3.46|46]] All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.

46: 

[[Lam.3.47|47]] Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.

47: 

[[Lam.3.48|48]] Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.

48: 

[[Lam.3.49|49]] Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,

49: 

[[Lam.3.50|50]] Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.

50: 

[[Lam.3.51|51]] Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.

51: 

[[Lam.3.52|52]] Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.

52: 

[[Lam.3.53|53]] They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.

53: 

[[Lam.3.54|54]] Waters flowed over mine head; \[then\] I said, I am cut off.

54: 

[[Lam.3.55|55]] I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.

55: 

[[Lam.3.56|56]] Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.

56: 

[[Lam.3.57|57]] Thou drewest near in the day \[that\] I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.

57: 

[[Lam.3.58|58]] O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.

58: 

[[Lam.3.59|59]] O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.

59: 

[[Lam.3.60|60]] Thou hast seen all their vengeance \[and\] all their imaginations against me.

60: 

[[Lam.3.61|61]] Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, \[and\] all their imaginations against me;

61: 

[[Lam.3.62|62]] The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.

62: 

[[Lam.3.63|63]] Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I \[am\] their musick.

63: 

[[Lam.3.64|64]] Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.

64: 

[[Lam.3.65|65]] Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.

65: 

[[Lam.3.66|66]] Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.

66:
