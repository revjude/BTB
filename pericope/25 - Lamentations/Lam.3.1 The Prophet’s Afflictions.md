[[Lam.3|Lamentations 3:1 - Lamentations 3:18]]
*The Prophet’s Afflictions*

[[Lam.3.1|1]] I \[am\] the man \[that\] hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.

1: 

[[Lam.3.2|2]] He hath led me, and brought \[me into\] darkness, but not \[into\] light.

2: 

[[Lam.3.3|3]] Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand \[against me\] all the day.

3: 

[[Lam.3.4|4]] My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.

4: 

[[Lam.3.5|5]] He hath builded against me, and compassed \[me\] with gall and travail.

5: 

[[Lam.3.6|6]] He hath set me in dark places, as \[they that be\] dead of old.

6: 

[[Lam.3.7|7]] He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.

7: 

[[Lam.3.8|8]] Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.

8: 

[[Lam.3.9|9]] He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.

9: 

[[Lam.3.10|10]] He \[was\] unto me \[as\] a bear lying in wait, \[and as\] a lion in secret places.

10: 

[[Lam.3.11|11]] He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.

11: 

[[Lam.3.12|12]] He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.

12: 

[[Lam.3.13|13]] He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.

13: 

[[Lam.3.14|14]] I was a derision to all my people; \[and\] their song all the day.

14: 

[[Lam.3.15|15]] He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.

15: 

[[Lam.3.16|16]] He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.

16: 

[[Lam.3.17|17]] And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.

17: 

[[Lam.3.18|18]] And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:

18:
