[[Lam.3|Lamentations 3:19 - Lamentations 3:36]]
*The Prophet’s Hope*

[[Lam.3.19|19]] Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.

19: 

[[Lam.3.20|20]] My soul hath \[them\] still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.

20: 

[[Lam.3.21|21]] This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.

21: 

[[Lam.3.22|22]] \[It is of\] the LORD’S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.

22: 

[[Lam.3.23|23]] \[They are\] new every morning: great \[is\] thy faithfulness.

23: 

[[Lam.3.24|24]] The LORD \[is\] my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.

24: 

[[Lam.3.25|25]] The LORD \[is\] good unto them that wait for him, to the soul \[that\] seeketh him.

25: 

[[Lam.3.26|26]] \[It is\] good that \[a man\] should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.

26: 

[[Lam.3.27|27]] \[It is\] good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.

27: 

[[Lam.3.28|28]] He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne \[it\] upon him.

28: 

[[Lam.3.29|29]] He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.

29: 

[[Lam.3.30|30]] He giveth \[his\] cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.

30: 

[[Lam.3.31|31]] For the Lord will not cast off for ever:

31: 

[[Lam.3.32|32]] But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.

32: 

[[Lam.3.33|33]] For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.

33: 

[[Lam.3.34|34]] To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,

34: 

[[Lam.3.35|35]] To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,

35: 

[[Lam.3.36|36]] To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.

36:
