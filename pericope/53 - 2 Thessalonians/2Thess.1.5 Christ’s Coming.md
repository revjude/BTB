[[2Thess.1|2 Thessalonians 1:5 - 2 Thessalonians 1:12]]
*Christ’s Coming*

[[2Thess.1.5|5]] \[Which is\] a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:

5: 

[[2Thess.1.6|6]] Seeing \[it is\] a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;

6: 

[[2Thess.1.7|7]] And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,

7: 

[[2Thess.1.8|8]] In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:

8: 

[[2Thess.1.9|9]] Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;

9: 

[[2Thess.1.10|10]] When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.

10: 

[[2Thess.1.11|11]] Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of \[this\] calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of \[his\] goodness, and the work of faith with power:

11: 

[[2Thess.1.12|12]] That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

12:
