[[2Thess.2|2 Thessalonians 2:13 - 2 Thessalonians 2:17]]
*Stand Firm*

[[2Thess.2.13|13]] But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:

13: 

[[2Thess.2.14|14]] Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

14: 

[[2Thess.2.15|15]] Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.

15: 

[[2Thess.2.16|16]] Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given \[us\] everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,

16: 

[[2Thess.2.17|17]] Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.

17:
