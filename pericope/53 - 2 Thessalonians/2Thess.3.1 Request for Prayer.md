[[2Thess.3|2 Thessalonians 3:1 - 2 Thessalonians 3:5]]
*Request for Prayer*

[[2Thess.3.1|1]] Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have \[free\] course, and be glorified, even as \[it is\] with you:

1: 

[[2Thess.3.2|2]] And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all \[men\] have not faith.

2: 

[[2Thess.3.3|3]] But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep \[you\] from evil.

3: 

[[2Thess.3.4|4]] And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.

4: 

[[2Thess.3.5|5]] And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.

5:
