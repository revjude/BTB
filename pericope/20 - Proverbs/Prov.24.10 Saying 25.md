[[Prov.24|Proverbs 24:10 - Proverbs 24:12]]
*Saying 25*

[[Prov.24.10|10]] \[If\] thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength \[is\] small.

10: 

[[Prov.24.11|11]] If thou forbear to deliver \[them that are\] drawn unto death, and \[those that are\] ready to be slain;

11: 

[[Prov.24.12|12]] If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider \[it\]? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth \[not\] he know \[it\]? and shall \[not\] he render to \[every\] man according to his works?

12:
