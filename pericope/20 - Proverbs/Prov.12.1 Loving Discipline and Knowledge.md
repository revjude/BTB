[[Prov.12|Proverbs 12:1 - Proverbs 12:28]]
*Loving Discipline and Knowledge*

[[Prov.12.1|1]] Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof \[is\] brutish.

1: 

[[Prov.12.2|2]] A good \[man\] obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn.

2: 

[[Prov.12.3|3]] A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.

3: 

[[Prov.12.4|4]] A virtuous woman \[is\] a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed \[is\] as rottenness in his bones.

4: 

[[Prov.12.5|5]] The thoughts of the righteous \[are\] right: \[but\] the counsels of the wicked \[are\] deceit.

5: 

[[Prov.12.6|6]] The words of the wicked \[are\] to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.

6: 

[[Prov.12.7|7]] The wicked are overthrown, and \[are\] not: but the house of the righteous shall stand.

7: 

[[Prov.12.8|8]] A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.

8: 

[[Prov.12.9|9]] \[He that is\] despised, and hath a servant, \[is\] better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.

9: 

[[Prov.12.10|10]] A righteous \[man\] regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked \[are\] cruel.

10: 

[[Prov.12.11|11]] He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain \[persons is\] void of understanding.

11: 

[[Prov.12.12|12]] The wicked desireth the net of evil \[men\]: but the root of the righteous yieldeth \[fruit\].

12: 

[[Prov.12.13|13]] The wicked is snared by the transgression of \[his\] lips: but the just shall come out of trouble.

13: 

[[Prov.12.14|14]] A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of \[his\] mouth: and the recompence of a man’s hands shall be rendered unto him.

14: 

[[Prov.12.15|15]] The way of a fool \[is\] right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel \[is\] wise.

15: 

[[Prov.12.16|16]] A fool’s wrath is presently known: but a prudent \[man\] covereth shame.

16: 

[[Prov.12.17|17]] \[He that\] speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit.

17: 

[[Prov.12.18|18]] There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise \[is\] health.

18: 

[[Prov.12.19|19]] The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue \[is\] but for a moment.

19: 

[[Prov.12.20|20]] Deceit \[is\] in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellers of peace \[is\] joy.

20: 

[[Prov.12.21|21]] There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.

21: 

[[Prov.12.22|22]] Lying lips \[are\] abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly \[are\] his delight.

22: 

[[Prov.12.23|23]] A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.

23: 

[[Prov.12.24|24]] The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute.

24: 

[[Prov.12.25|25]] Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad.

25: 

[[Prov.12.26|26]] The righteous \[is\] more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them.

26: 

[[Prov.12.27|27]] The slothful \[man\] roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man \[is\] precious.

27: 

[[Prov.12.28|28]] In the way of righteousness \[is\] life; and \[in\] the pathway \[thereof there is\] no death.

28:
