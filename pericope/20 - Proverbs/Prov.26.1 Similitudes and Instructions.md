[[Prov.26|Proverbs 26:1 - Proverbs 26:28]]
*Similitudes and Instructions*

[[Prov.26.1|1]] As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool.

1: 

[[Prov.26.2|2]] As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.

2: 

[[Prov.26.3|3]] A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool’s back.

3: 

[[Prov.26.4|4]] Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.

4: 

[[Prov.26.5|5]] Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.

5: 

[[Prov.26.6|6]] He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, \[and\] drinketh damage.

6: 

[[Prov.26.7|7]] The legs of the lame are not equal: so \[is\] a parable in the mouth of fools.

7: 

[[Prov.26.8|8]] As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so \[is\] he that giveth honour to a fool.

8: 

[[Prov.26.9|9]] \[As\] a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so \[is\] a parable in the mouth of fools.

9: 

[[Prov.26.10|10]] The great \[God\] that formed all \[things\] both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.

10: 

[[Prov.26.11|11]] As a dog returneth to his vomit, \[so\] a fool returneth to his folly.

11: 

[[Prov.26.12|12]] Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? \[there is\] more hope of a fool than of him.

12: 

[[Prov.26.13|13]] The slothful \[man\] saith, \[There is\] a lion in the way; a lion \[is\] in the streets.

13: 

[[Prov.26.14|14]] \[As\] the door turneth upon his hinges, so \[doth\] the slothful upon his bed.

14: 

[[Prov.26.15|15]] The slothful hideth his hand in \[his\] bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth.

15: 

[[Prov.26.16|16]] The sluggard \[is\] wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.

16: 

[[Prov.26.17|17]] He that passeth by, \[and\] meddleth with strife \[belonging\] not to him, \[is like\] one that taketh a dog by the ears.

17: 

[[Prov.26.18|18]] As a mad \[man\] who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,

18: 

[[Prov.26.19|19]] So \[is\] the man \[that\] deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?

19: 

[[Prov.26.20|20]] Where no wood is, \[there\] the fire goeth out: so where \[there is\] no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.

20: 

[[Prov.26.21|21]] \[As\] coals \[are\] to burning coals, and wood to fire; so \[is\] a contentious man to kindle strife.

21: 

[[Prov.26.22|22]] The words of a talebearer \[are\] as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.

22: 

[[Prov.26.23|23]] Burning lips and a wicked heart \[are like\] a potsherd covered with silver dross.

23: 

[[Prov.26.24|24]] He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him;

24: 

[[Prov.26.25|25]] When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for \[there are\] seven abominations in his heart.

25: 

[[Prov.26.26|26]] \[Whose\] hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the \[whole\] congregation.

26: 

[[Prov.26.27|27]] Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him.

27: 

[[Prov.26.28|28]] A lying tongue hateth \[those that are\] afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.

28:
