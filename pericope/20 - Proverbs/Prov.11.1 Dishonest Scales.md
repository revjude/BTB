[[Prov.11|Proverbs 11:1 - Proverbs 11:31]]
*Dishonest Scales*

[[Prov.11.1|1]] A false balance \[is\] abomination to the LORD: but a just weight \[is\] his delight.

1: 

[[Prov.11.2|2]] \[When\] pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly \[is\] wisdom.

2: 

[[Prov.11.3|3]] The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.

3: 

[[Prov.11.4|4]] Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death.

4: 

[[Prov.11.5|5]] The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.

5: 

[[Prov.11.6|6]] The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in \[their own\] naughtiness.

6: 

[[Prov.11.7|7]] When a wicked man dieth, \[his\] expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust \[men\] perisheth.

7: 

[[Prov.11.8|8]] The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.

8: 

[[Prov.11.9|9]] An hypocrite with \[his\] mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.

9: 

[[Prov.11.10|10]] When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, \[there is\] shouting.

10: 

[[Prov.11.11|11]] By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.

11: 

[[Prov.11.12|12]] He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.

12: 

[[Prov.11.13|13]] A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.

13: 

[[Prov.11.14|14]] Where no counsel \[is\], the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellers \[there is\] safety.

14: 

[[Prov.11.15|15]] He that is surety for a stranger shall smart \[for it\]: and he that hateth suretiship is sure.

15: 

[[Prov.11.16|16]] A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong \[men\] retain riches.

16: 

[[Prov.11.17|17]] The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but \[he that is\] cruel troubleth his own flesh.

17: 

[[Prov.11.18|18]] The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness \[shall be\] a sure reward.

18: 

[[Prov.11.19|19]] As righteousness \[tendeth\] to life: so he that pursueth evil \[pursueth it\] to his own death.

19: 

[[Prov.11.20|20]] They that are of a froward heart \[are\] abomination to the LORD: but \[such as are\] upright in \[their\] way \[are\] his delight.

20: 

[[Prov.11.21|21]] \[Though\] hand \[join\] in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.

21: 

[[Prov.11.22|22]] \[As\] a jewel of gold in a swine’s snout, \[so is\] a fair woman which is without discretion.

22: 

[[Prov.11.23|23]] The desire of the righteous \[is\] only good: \[but\] the expectation of the wicked \[is\] wrath.

23: 

[[Prov.11.24|24]] There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and \[there is\] that withholdeth more than is meet, but \[it tendeth\] to poverty.

24: 

[[Prov.11.25|25]] The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.

25: 

[[Prov.11.26|26]] He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing \[shall be\] upon the head of him that selleth \[it\].

26: 

[[Prov.11.27|27]] He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.

27: 

[[Prov.11.28|28]] He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.

28: 

[[Prov.11.29|29]] He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool \[shall be\] servant to the wise of heart.

29: 

[[Prov.11.30|30]] The fruit of the righteous \[is\] a tree of life; and he that winneth souls \[is\] wise.

30: 

[[Prov.11.31|31]] Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.

31:
