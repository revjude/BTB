[[Prov.1|Proverbs 1:8 - Proverbs 1:19]]
*The Enticement of Sin*

[[Prov.1.8|8]] My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:

8: 

[[Prov.1.9|9]] For they \[shall be\] an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.

9: 

[[Prov.1.10|10]] My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.

10: 

[[Prov.1.11|11]] If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:

11: 

[[Prov.1.12|12]] Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:

12: 

[[Prov.1.13|13]] We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:

13: 

[[Prov.1.14|14]] Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:

14: 

[[Prov.1.15|15]] My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:

15: 

[[Prov.1.16|16]] For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.

16: 

[[Prov.1.17|17]] Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.

17: 

[[Prov.1.18|18]] And they lay wait for their \[own\] blood; they lurk privily for their \[own\] lives.

18: 

[[Prov.1.19|19]] So \[are\] the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; \[which\] taketh away the life of the owners thereof.

19:
