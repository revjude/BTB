[[Prov.1|Proverbs 1:20 - Proverbs 1:33]]
*Wisdom Calls Aloud*

[[Prov.1.20|20]] Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:

20: 

[[Prov.1.21|21]] She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, \[saying\],

21: 

[[Prov.1.22|22]] How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?

22: 

[[Prov.1.23|23]] Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.

23: 

[[Prov.1.24|24]] Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;

24: 

[[Prov.1.25|25]] But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:

25: 

[[Prov.1.26|26]] I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;

26: 

[[Prov.1.27|27]] When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.

27: 

[[Prov.1.28|28]] Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:

28: 

[[Prov.1.29|29]] For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:

29: 

[[Prov.1.30|30]] They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.

30: 

[[Prov.1.31|31]] Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.

31: 

[[Prov.1.32|32]] For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.

32: 

[[Prov.1.33|33]] But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.

33:
