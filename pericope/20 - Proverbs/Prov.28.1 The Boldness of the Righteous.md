[[Prov.28|Proverbs 28:1 - Proverbs 28:28]]
*The Boldness of the Righteous*

[[Prov.28.1|1]] The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.

1: 

[[Prov.28.2|2]] For the transgression of a land many \[are\] the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding \[and\] knowledge the state \[thereof\] shall be prolonged.

2: 

[[Prov.28.3|3]] A poor man that oppresseth the poor \[is like\] a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.

3: 

[[Prov.28.4|4]] They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.

4: 

[[Prov.28.5|5]] Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all \[things\].

5: 

[[Prov.28.6|6]] Better \[is\] the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than \[he that is\] perverse \[in his\] ways, though he \[be\] rich.

6: 

[[Prov.28.7|7]] Whoso keepeth the law \[is\] a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous \[men\] shameth his father.

7: 

[[Prov.28.8|8]] He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.

8: 

[[Prov.28.9|9]] He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer \[shall be\] abomination.

9: 

[[Prov.28.10|10]] Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good \[things\] in possession.

10: 

[[Prov.28.11|11]] The rich man \[is\] wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.

11: 

[[Prov.28.12|12]] When righteous \[men\] do rejoice, \[there is\] great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.

12: 

[[Prov.28.13|13]] He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh \[them\] shall have mercy.

13: 

[[Prov.28.14|14]] Happy \[is\] the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.

14: 

[[Prov.28.15|15]] \[As\] a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; \[so is\] a wicked ruler over the poor people.

15: 

[[Prov.28.16|16]] The prince that wanteth understanding \[is\] also a great oppressor: \[but\] he that hateth covetousness shall prolong \[his\] days.

16: 

[[Prov.28.17|17]] A man that doeth violence to the blood of \[any\] person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.

17: 

[[Prov.28.18|18]] Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but \[he that is\] perverse \[in his\] ways shall fall at once.

18: 

[[Prov.28.19|19]] He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain \[persons\] shall have poverty enough.

19: 

[[Prov.28.20|20]] A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.

20: 

[[Prov.28.21|21]] To have respect of persons \[is\] not good: for for a piece of bread \[that\] man will transgress.

21: 

[[Prov.28.22|22]] He that hasteth to be rich \[hath\] an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.

22: 

[[Prov.28.23|23]] He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.

23: 

[[Prov.28.24|24]] Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, \[It is\] no transgression; the same \[is\] the companion of a destroyer.

24: 

[[Prov.28.25|25]] He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.

25: 

[[Prov.28.26|26]] He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.

26: 

[[Prov.28.27|27]] He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.

27: 

[[Prov.28.28|28]] When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.

28:
