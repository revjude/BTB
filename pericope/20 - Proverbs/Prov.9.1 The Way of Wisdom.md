[[Prov.9|Proverbs 9:1 - Proverbs 9:12]]
*The Way of Wisdom*

[[Prov.9.1|1]] Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:

1: 

[[Prov.9.2|2]] She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.

2: 

[[Prov.9.3|3]] She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,

3: 

[[Prov.9.4|4]] Whoso \[is\] simple, let him turn in hither: \[as for\] him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,

4: 

[[Prov.9.5|5]] Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine \[which\] I have mingled.

5: 

[[Prov.9.6|6]] Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.

6: 

[[Prov.9.7|7]] He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked \[man getteth\] himself a blot.

7: 

[[Prov.9.8|8]] Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.

8: 

[[Prov.9.9|9]] Give \[instruction\] to a wise \[man\], and he will be yet wiser: teach a just \[man\], and he will increase in learning.

9: 

[[Prov.9.10|10]] The fear of the LORD \[is\] the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy \[is\] understanding.

10: 

[[Prov.9.11|11]] For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.

11: 

[[Prov.9.12|12]] If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but \[if\] thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear \[it\].

12:
