[[Prov.14|Proverbs 14:1 - Proverbs 14:35]]
*The Wise Woman*

[[Prov.14.1|1]] Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.

1: 

[[Prov.14.2|2]] He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but \[he that is\] perverse in his ways despiseth him.

2: 

[[Prov.14.3|3]] In the mouth of the foolish \[is\] a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them.

3: 

[[Prov.14.4|4]] Where no oxen \[are\], the crib \[is\] clean: but much increase \[is\] by the strength of the ox.

4: 

[[Prov.14.5|5]] A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies.

5: 

[[Prov.14.6|6]] A scorner seeketh wisdom, and \[findeth it\] not: but knowledge \[is\] easy unto him that understandeth.

6: 

[[Prov.14.7|7]] Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not \[in him\] the lips of knowledge.

7: 

[[Prov.14.8|8]] The wisdom of the prudent \[is\] to understand his way: but the folly of fools \[is\] deceit.

8: 

[[Prov.14.9|9]] Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous \[there is\] favour.

9: 

[[Prov.14.10|10]] The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.

10: 

[[Prov.14.11|11]] The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.

11: 

[[Prov.14.12|12]] There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof \[are\] the ways of death.

12: 

[[Prov.14.13|13]] Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth \[is\] heaviness.

13: 

[[Prov.14.14|14]] The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man \[shall be satisfied\] from himself.

14: 

[[Prov.14.15|15]] The simple believeth every word: but the prudent \[man\] looketh well to his going.

15: 

[[Prov.14.16|16]] A wise \[man\] feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident.

16: 

[[Prov.14.17|17]] \[He that is\] soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated.

17: 

[[Prov.14.18|18]] The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

18: 

[[Prov.14.19|19]] The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.

19: 

[[Prov.14.20|20]] The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich \[hath\] many friends.

20: 

[[Prov.14.21|21]] He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy \[is\] he.

21: 

[[Prov.14.22|22]] Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth \[shall be\] to them that devise good.

22: 

[[Prov.14.23|23]] In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips \[tendeth\] only to penury.

23: 

[[Prov.14.24|24]] The crown of the wise \[is\] their riches: \[but\] the foolishness of fools \[is\] folly.

24: 

[[Prov.14.25|25]] A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful \[witness\] speaketh lies.

25: 

[[Prov.14.26|26]] In the fear of the LORD \[is\] strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge.

26: 

[[Prov.14.27|27]] The fear of the LORD \[is\] a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.

27: 

[[Prov.14.28|28]] In the multitude of people \[is\] the king’s honour: but in the want of people \[is\] the destruction of the prince.

28: 

[[Prov.14.29|29]] \[He that is\] slow to wrath \[is\] of great understanding: but \[he that is\] hasty of spirit exalteth folly.

29: 

[[Prov.14.30|30]] A sound heart \[is\] the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones.

30: 

[[Prov.14.31|31]] He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.

31: 

[[Prov.14.32|32]] The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death.

32: 

[[Prov.14.33|33]] Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but \[that which is\] in the midst of fools is made known.

33: 

[[Prov.14.34|34]] Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin \[is\] a reproach to any people.

34: 

[[Prov.14.35|35]] The king’s favour \[is\] toward a wise servant: but his wrath is \[against\] him that causeth shame.

35:
