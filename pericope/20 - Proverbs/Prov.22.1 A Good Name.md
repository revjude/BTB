[[Prov.22|Proverbs 22:1 - Proverbs 22:16]]
*A Good Name*

[[Prov.22.1|1]] A \[good\] name \[is\] rather to be chosen than great riches, \[and\] loving favour rather than silver and gold.

1: 

[[Prov.22.2|2]] The rich and poor meet together: the LORD \[is\] the maker of them all.

2: 

[[Prov.22.3|3]] A prudent \[man\] foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.

3: 

[[Prov.22.4|4]] By humility \[and\] the fear of the LORD \[are\] riches, and honour, and life.

4: 

[[Prov.22.5|5]] Thorns \[and\] snares \[are\] in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.

5: 

[[Prov.22.6|6]] Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.

6: 

[[Prov.22.7|7]] The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower \[is\] servant to the lender.

7: 

[[Prov.22.8|8]] He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail.

8: 

[[Prov.22.9|9]] He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor.

9: 

[[Prov.22.10|10]] Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease.

10: 

[[Prov.22.11|11]] He that loveth pureness of heart, \[for\] the grace of his lips the king \[shall be\] his friend.

11: 

[[Prov.22.12|12]] The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor.

12: 

[[Prov.22.13|13]] The slothful \[man\] saith, \[There is\] a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets.

13: 

[[Prov.22.14|14]] The mouth of strange women \[is\] a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.

14: 

[[Prov.22.15|15]] Foolishness \[is\] bound in the heart of a child; \[but\] the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.

15: 

[[Prov.22.16|16]] He that oppresseth the poor to increase his \[riches, and\] he that giveth to the rich, \[shall\] surely \[come\] to want.

16:
