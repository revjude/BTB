[[Prov.24|Proverbs 24:23 - Proverbs 24:34]]
*Further Sayings of the Wise*

[[Prov.24.23|23]] These \[things\] also \[belong\] to the wise. \[It is\] not good to have respect of persons in judgment.

23: 

[[Prov.24.24|24]] He that saith unto the wicked, Thou \[art\] righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:

24: 

[[Prov.24.25|25]] But to them that rebuke \[him\] shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.

25: 

[[Prov.24.26|26]] \[Every man\] shall kiss \[his\] lips that giveth a right answer.

26: 

[[Prov.24.27|27]] Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.

27: 

[[Prov.24.28|28]] Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive \[not\] with thy lips.

28: 

[[Prov.24.29|29]] Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.

29: 

[[Prov.24.30|30]] I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;

30: 

[[Prov.24.31|31]] And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, \[and\] nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.

31: 

[[Prov.24.32|32]] Then I saw, \[and\] considered \[it\] well: I looked upon \[it, and\] received instruction.

32: 

[[Prov.24.33|33]] \[Yet\] a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:

33: 

[[Prov.24.34|34]] So shall thy poverty come \[as\] one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.

34:
