[[Prov.7|Proverbs 7:1 - Proverbs 7:27]]
*Warnings about the Adulteress*

[[Prov.7.1|1]] My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.

1: 

[[Prov.7.2|2]] Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.

2: 

[[Prov.7.3|3]] Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.

3: 

[[Prov.7.4|4]] Say unto wisdom, Thou \[art\] my sister; and call understanding \[thy\] kinswoman:

4: 

[[Prov.7.5|5]] That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger \[which\] flattereth with her words.

5: 

[[Prov.7.6|6]] For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,

6: 

[[Prov.7.7|7]] And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,

7: 

[[Prov.7.8|8]] Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,

8: 

[[Prov.7.9|9]] In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:

9: 

[[Prov.7.10|10]] And, behold, there met him a woman \[with\] the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.

10: 

[[Prov.7.11|11]] (She \[is\] loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:

11: 

[[Prov.7.12|12]] Now \[is she\] without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)

12: 

[[Prov.7.13|13]] So she caught him, and kissed him, \[and\] with an impudent face said unto him,

13: 

[[Prov.7.14|14]] \[I have\] peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.

14: 

[[Prov.7.15|15]] Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.

15: 

[[Prov.7.16|16]] I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved \[works\], with fine linen of Egypt.

16: 

[[Prov.7.17|17]] I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

17: 

[[Prov.7.18|18]] Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.

18: 

[[Prov.7.19|19]] For the goodman \[is\] not at home, he is gone a long journey:

19: 

[[Prov.7.20|20]] He hath taken a bag of money with him, \[and\] will come home at the day appointed.

20: 

[[Prov.7.21|21]] With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.

21: 

[[Prov.7.22|22]] He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;

22: 

[[Prov.7.23|23]] Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it \[is\] for his life.

23: 

[[Prov.7.24|24]] Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.

24: 

[[Prov.7.25|25]] Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.

25: 

[[Prov.7.26|26]] For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong \[men\] have been slain by her.

26: 

[[Prov.7.27|27]] Her house \[is\] the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.

27:
