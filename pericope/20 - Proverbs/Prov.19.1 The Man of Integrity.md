[[Prov.19|Proverbs 19:1 - Proverbs 19:29]]
*The Man of Integrity*

[[Prov.19.1|1]] Better \[is\] the poor that walketh in his integrity, than \[he that is\] perverse in his lips, and is a fool.

1: 

[[Prov.19.2|2]] Also, \[that\] the soul \[be\] without knowledge, \[it is\] not good; and he that hasteth with \[his\] feet sinneth.

2: 

[[Prov.19.3|3]] The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.

3: 

[[Prov.19.4|4]] Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.

4: 

[[Prov.19.5|5]] A false witness shall not be unpunished, and \[he that\] speaketh lies shall not escape.

5: 

[[Prov.19.6|6]] Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man \[is\] a friend to him that giveth gifts.

6: 

[[Prov.19.7|7]] All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth \[them with\] words, \[yet\] they \[are\] wanting \[to him\].

7: 

[[Prov.19.8|8]] He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.

8: 

[[Prov.19.9|9]] A false witness shall not be unpunished, and \[he that\] speaketh lies shall perish.

9: 

[[Prov.19.10|10]] Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.

10: 

[[Prov.19.11|11]] The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and \[it is\] his glory to pass over a transgression.

11: 

[[Prov.19.12|12]] The king’s wrath \[is\] as the roaring of a lion; but his favour \[is\] as dew upon the grass.

12: 

[[Prov.19.13|13]] A foolish son \[is\] the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife \[are\] a continual dropping.

13: 

[[Prov.19.14|14]] House and riches \[are\] the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife \[is\] from the LORD.

14: 

[[Prov.19.15|15]] Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.

15: 

[[Prov.19.16|16]] He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; \[but\] he that despiseth his ways shall die.

16: 

[[Prov.19.17|17]] He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.

17: 

[[Prov.19.18|18]] Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.

18: 

[[Prov.19.19|19]] A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver \[him\], yet thou must do it again.

19: 

[[Prov.19.20|20]] Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.

20: 

[[Prov.19.21|21]] \[There are\] many devices in a man’s heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.

21: 

[[Prov.19.22|22]] The desire of a man \[is\] his kindness: and a poor man \[is\] better than a liar.

22: 

[[Prov.19.23|23]] The fear of the LORD \[tendeth\] to life: and \[he that hath it\] shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.

23: 

[[Prov.19.24|24]] A slothful \[man\] hideth his hand in \[his\] bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.

24: 

[[Prov.19.25|25]] Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, \[and\] he will understand knowledge.

25: 

[[Prov.19.26|26]] He that wasteth \[his\] father, \[and\] chaseth away \[his\] mother, \[is\] a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.

26: 

[[Prov.19.27|27]] Cease, my son, to hear the instruction \[that causeth\] to err from the words of knowledge.

27: 

[[Prov.19.28|28]] An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.

28: 

[[Prov.19.29|29]] Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.

29:
