[[Prov.5|Proverbs 5:1 - Proverbs 5:23]]
*Avoiding Immorality*

[[Prov.5.1|1]] My son, attend unto my wisdom, \[and\] bow thine ear to my understanding:

1: 

[[Prov.5.2|2]] That thou mayest regard discretion, and \[that\] thy lips may keep knowledge.

2: 

[[Prov.5.3|3]] For the lips of a strange woman drop \[as\] an honeycomb, and her mouth \[is\] smoother than oil:

3: 

[[Prov.5.4|4]] But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.

4: 

[[Prov.5.5|5]] Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.

5: 

[[Prov.5.6|6]] Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, \[that\] thou canst not know \[them\].

6: 

[[Prov.5.7|7]] Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.

7: 

[[Prov.5.8|8]] Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:

8: 

[[Prov.5.9|9]] Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:

9: 

[[Prov.5.10|10]] Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours \[be\] in the house of a stranger;

10: 

[[Prov.5.11|11]] And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,

11: 

[[Prov.5.12|12]] And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;

12: 

[[Prov.5.13|13]] And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!

13: 

[[Prov.5.14|14]] I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.

14: 

[[Prov.5.15|15]] Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.

15: 

[[Prov.5.16|16]] Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, \[and\] rivers of waters in the streets.

16: 

[[Prov.5.17|17]] Let them be only thine own, and not strangers’ with thee.

17: 

[[Prov.5.18|18]] Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.

18: 

[[Prov.5.19|19]] \[Let her be as\] the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.

19: 

[[Prov.5.20|20]] And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?

20: 

[[Prov.5.21|21]] For the ways of man \[are\] before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.

21: 

[[Prov.5.22|22]] His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.

22: 

[[Prov.5.23|23]] He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.

23:
