[[Prov.31|Proverbs 31:10 - Proverbs 31:31]]
*The Virtues of a Noble Woman*

[[Prov.31.10|10]] Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price \[is\] far above rubies.

10: 

[[Prov.31.11|11]] The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.

11: 

[[Prov.31.12|12]] She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.

12: 

[[Prov.31.13|13]] She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.

13: 

[[Prov.31.14|14]] She is like the merchants’ ships; she bringeth her food from afar.

14: 

[[Prov.31.15|15]] She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.

15: 

[[Prov.31.16|16]] She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.

16: 

[[Prov.31.17|17]] She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.

17: 

[[Prov.31.18|18]] She perceiveth that her merchandise \[is\] good: her candle goeth not out by night.

18: 

[[Prov.31.19|19]] She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.

19: 

[[Prov.31.20|20]] She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.

20: 

[[Prov.31.21|21]] She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household \[are\] clothed with scarlet.

21: 

[[Prov.31.22|22]] She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing \[is\] silk and purple.

22: 

[[Prov.31.23|23]] Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.

23: 

[[Prov.31.24|24]] She maketh fine linen, and selleth \[it\]; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.

24: 

[[Prov.31.25|25]] Strength and honour \[are\] her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.

25: 

[[Prov.31.26|26]] She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue \[is\] the law of kindness.

26: 

[[Prov.31.27|27]] She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.

27: 

[[Prov.31.28|28]] Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband \[also\], and he praiseth her.

28: 

[[Prov.31.29|29]] Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.

29: 

[[Prov.31.30|30]] Favour \[is\] deceitful, and beauty \[is\] vain: \[but\] a woman \[that\] feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.

30: 

[[Prov.31.31|31]] Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.

31:
