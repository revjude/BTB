[[Prov.16|Proverbs 16:1 - Proverbs 16:33]]
*The Reply of the Tongue Is from the LORD*

[[Prov.16.1|1]] The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, \[is\] from the LORD.

1: 

[[Prov.16.2|2]] All the ways of a man \[are\] clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits.

2: 

[[Prov.16.3|3]] Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.

3: 

[[Prov.16.4|4]] The LORD hath made all \[things\] for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.

4: 

[[Prov.16.5|5]] Every one \[that is\] proud in heart \[is\] an abomination to the LORD: \[though\] hand \[join\] in hand, he shall not be unpunished.

5: 

[[Prov.16.6|6]] By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD \[men\] depart from evil.

6: 

[[Prov.16.7|7]] When a man’s ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.

7: 

[[Prov.16.8|8]] Better \[is\] a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.

8: 

[[Prov.16.9|9]] A man’s heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.

9: 

[[Prov.16.10|10]] A divine sentence \[is\] in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.

10: 

[[Prov.16.11|11]] A just weight and balance \[are\] the LORD’S: all the weights of the bag \[are\] his work.

11: 

[[Prov.16.12|12]] \[It is\] an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.

12: 

[[Prov.16.13|13]] Righteous lips \[are\] the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.

13: 

[[Prov.16.14|14]] The wrath of a king \[is as\] messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.

14: 

[[Prov.16.15|15]] In the light of the king’s countenance \[is\] life; and his favour \[is\] as a cloud of the latter rain.

15: 

[[Prov.16.16|16]] How much better \[is it\] to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!

16: 

[[Prov.16.17|17]] The highway of the upright \[is\] to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.

17: 

[[Prov.16.18|18]] Pride \[goeth\] before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.

18: 

[[Prov.16.19|19]] Better \[it is to be\] of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.

19: 

[[Prov.16.20|20]] He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy \[is\] he.

20: 

[[Prov.16.21|21]] The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.

21: 

[[Prov.16.22|22]] Understanding \[is\] a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools \[is\] folly.

22: 

[[Prov.16.23|23]] The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.

23: 

[[Prov.16.24|24]] Pleasant words \[are as\] an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.

24: 

[[Prov.16.25|25]] There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof \[are\] the ways of death.

25: 

[[Prov.16.26|26]] He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.

26: 

[[Prov.16.27|27]] An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips \[there is\] as a burning fire.

27: 

[[Prov.16.28|28]] A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.

28: 

[[Prov.16.29|29]] A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way \[that is\] not good.

29: 

[[Prov.16.30|30]] He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.

30: 

[[Prov.16.31|31]] The hoary head \[is\] a crown of glory, \[if\] it be found in the way of righteousness.

31: 

[[Prov.16.32|32]] \[He that is\] slow to anger \[is\] better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.

32: 

[[Prov.16.33|33]] The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof \[is\] of the LORD.

33:
