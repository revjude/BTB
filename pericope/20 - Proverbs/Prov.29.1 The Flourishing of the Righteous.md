[[Prov.29|Proverbs 29:1 - Proverbs 29:27]]
*The Flourishing of the Righteous*

[[Prov.29.1|1]] He, that being often reproved hardeneth \[his\] neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.

1: 

[[Prov.29.2|2]] When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.

2: 

[[Prov.29.3|3]] Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth \[his\] substance.

3: 

[[Prov.29.4|4]] The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.

4: 

[[Prov.29.5|5]] A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.

5: 

[[Prov.29.6|6]] In the transgression of an evil man \[there is\] a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice.

6: 

[[Prov.29.7|7]] The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: \[but\] the wicked regardeth not to know \[it\].

7: 

[[Prov.29.8|8]] Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise \[men\] turn away wrath.

8: 

[[Prov.29.9|9]] \[If\] a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, \[there is\] no rest.

9: 

[[Prov.29.10|10]] The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.

10: 

[[Prov.29.11|11]] A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise \[man\] keepeth it in till afterwards.

11: 

[[Prov.29.12|12]] If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants \[are\] wicked.

12: 

[[Prov.29.13|13]] The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes.

13: 

[[Prov.29.14|14]] The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.

14: 

[[Prov.29.15|15]] The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left \[to himself\] bringeth his mother to shame.

15: 

[[Prov.29.16|16]] When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall.

16: 

[[Prov.29.17|17]] Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.

17: 

[[Prov.29.18|18]] Where \[there is\] no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy \[is\] he.

18: 

[[Prov.29.19|19]] A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer.

19: 

[[Prov.29.20|20]] Seest thou a man \[that is\] hasty in his words? \[there is\] more hope of a fool than of him.

20: 

[[Prov.29.21|21]] He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become \[his\] son at the length.

21: 

[[Prov.29.22|22]] An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.

22: 

[[Prov.29.23|23]] A man’s pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.

23: 

[[Prov.29.24|24]] Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth \[it\] not.

24: 

[[Prov.29.25|25]] The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe.

25: 

[[Prov.29.26|26]] Many seek the ruler’s favour; but \[every\] man’s judgment \[cometh\] from the LORD.

26: 

[[Prov.29.27|27]] An unjust man \[is\] an abomination to the just: and \[he that is\] upright in the way \[is\] abomination to the wicked.

27:
