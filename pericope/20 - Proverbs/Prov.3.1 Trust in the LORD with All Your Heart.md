[[Prov.3|Proverbs 3:1 - Proverbs 3:12]]
*Trust in the LORD with All Your Heart*

[[Prov.3.1|1]] My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:

1: 

[[Prov.3.2|2]] For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.

2: 

[[Prov.3.3|3]] Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:

3: 

[[Prov.3.4|4]] So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.

4: 

[[Prov.3.5|5]] Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.

5: 

[[Prov.3.6|6]] In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.

6: 

[[Prov.3.7|7]] Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.

7: 

[[Prov.3.8|8]] It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.

8: 

[[Prov.3.9|9]] Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:

9: 

[[Prov.3.10|10]] So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.

10: 

[[Prov.3.11|11]] My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:

11: 

[[Prov.3.12|12]] For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son \[in whom\] he delighteth.

12:
