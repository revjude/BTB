[[Prov.2|Proverbs 2:1 - Proverbs 2:22]]
*The Benefits of Wisdom*

[[Prov.2.1|1]] My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;

1: 

[[Prov.2.2|2]] So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, \[and\] apply thine heart to understanding;

2: 

[[Prov.2.3|3]] Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, \[and\] liftest up thy voice for understanding;

3: 

[[Prov.2.4|4]] If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as \[for\] hid treasures;

4: 

[[Prov.2.5|5]] Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.

5: 

[[Prov.2.6|6]] For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth \[cometh\] knowledge and understanding.

6: 

[[Prov.2.7|7]] He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: \[he is\] a buckler to them that walk uprightly.

7: 

[[Prov.2.8|8]] He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.

8: 

[[Prov.2.9|9]] Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; \[yea\], every good path.

9: 

[[Prov.2.10|10]] When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;

10: 

[[Prov.2.11|11]] Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:

11: 

[[Prov.2.12|12]] To deliver thee from the way of the evil \[man\], from the man that speaketh froward things;

12: 

[[Prov.2.13|13]] Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;

13: 

[[Prov.2.14|14]] Who rejoice to do evil, \[and\] delight in the frowardness of the wicked;

14: 

[[Prov.2.15|15]] Whose ways \[are\] crooked, and \[they\] froward in their paths:

15: 

[[Prov.2.16|16]] To deliver thee from the strange woman, \[even\] from the stranger \[which\] flattereth with her words;

16: 

[[Prov.2.17|17]] Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.

17: 

[[Prov.2.18|18]] For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.

18: 

[[Prov.2.19|19]] None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.

19: 

[[Prov.2.20|20]] That thou mayest walk in the way of good \[men\], and keep the paths of the righteous.

20: 

[[Prov.2.21|21]] For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.

21: 

[[Prov.2.22|22]] But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.

22:
