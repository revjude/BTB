[[Prov.6|Proverbs 6:20 - Proverbs 6:35]]
*Warnings against Adultery*

[[Prov.6.20|20]] My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:

20: 

[[Prov.6.21|21]] Bind them continually upon thine heart, \[and\] tie them about thy neck.

21: 

[[Prov.6.22|22]] When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and \[when\] thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.

22: 

[[Prov.6.23|23]] For the commandment \[is\] a lamp; and the law \[is\] light; and reproofs of instruction \[are\] the way of life:

23: 

[[Prov.6.24|24]] To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.

24: 

[[Prov.6.25|25]] Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.

25: 

[[Prov.6.26|26]] For by means of a whorish woman \[a man is brought\] to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.

26: 

[[Prov.6.27|27]] Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?

27: 

[[Prov.6.28|28]] Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?

28: 

[[Prov.6.29|29]] So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.

29: 

[[Prov.6.30|30]] \[Men\] do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;

30: 

[[Prov.6.31|31]] But \[if\] he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.

31: 

[[Prov.6.32|32]] \[But\] whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he \[that\] doeth it destroyeth his own soul.

32: 

[[Prov.6.33|33]] A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.

33: 

[[Prov.6.34|34]] For jealousy \[is\] the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.

34: 

[[Prov.6.35|35]] He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.

35:
