[[Prov.9|Proverbs 9:13 - Proverbs 9:18]]
*The Way of Folly*

[[Prov.9.13|13]] A foolish woman \[is\] clamorous: \[she is\] simple, and knoweth nothing.

13: 

[[Prov.9.14|14]] For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,

14: 

[[Prov.9.15|15]] To call passengers who go right on their ways:

15: 

[[Prov.9.16|16]] Whoso \[is\] simple, let him turn in hither: and \[as for\] him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,

16: 

[[Prov.9.17|17]] Stolen waters are sweet, and bread \[eaten\] in secret is pleasant.

17: 

[[Prov.9.18|18]] But he knoweth not that the dead \[are\] there; \[and that\] her guests \[are\] in the depths of hell.

18:
