[[Prov.30|Proverbs 30:1 - Proverbs 30:33]]
*The Words of Agur*

[[Prov.30.1|1]] The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, \[even\] the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,

1: 

[[Prov.30.2|2]] Surely I \[am\] more brutish than \[any\] man, and have not the understanding of a man.

2: 

[[Prov.30.3|3]] I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.

3: 

[[Prov.30.4|4]] Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what \[is\] his name, and what \[is\] his son’s name, if thou canst tell?

4: 

[[Prov.30.5|5]] Every word of God \[is\] pure: he \[is\] a shield unto them that put their trust in him.

5: 

[[Prov.30.6|6]] Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.

6: 

[[Prov.30.7|7]] Two \[things\] have I required of thee; deny me \[them\] not before I die:

7: 

[[Prov.30.8|8]] Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:

8: 

[[Prov.30.9|9]] Lest I be full, and deny \[thee\], and say, Who \[is\] the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God \[in vain\].

9: 

[[Prov.30.10|10]] Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.

10: 

[[Prov.30.11|11]] \[There is\] a generation \[that\] curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.

11: 

[[Prov.30.12|12]] \[There is\] a generation \[that are\] pure in their own eyes, and \[yet\] is not washed from their filthiness.

12: 

[[Prov.30.13|13]] \[There is\] a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.

13: 

[[Prov.30.14|14]] \[There is\] a generation, whose teeth \[are as\] swords, and their jaw teeth \[as\] knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from \[among\] men.

14: 

[[Prov.30.15|15]] The horseleach hath two daughters, \[crying\], Give, give. There are three \[things that\] are never satisfied, \[yea\], four \[things\] say not, \[It is\] enough:

15: 

[[Prov.30.16|16]] The grave; and the barren womb; the earth \[that\] is not filled with water; and the fire \[that\] saith not, \[It is\] enough.

16: 

[[Prov.30.17|17]] The eye \[that\] mocketh at \[his\] father, and despiseth to obey \[his\] mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.

17: 

[[Prov.30.18|18]] There be three \[things which\] are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:

18: 

[[Prov.30.19|19]] The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.

19: 

[[Prov.30.20|20]] Such \[is\] the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.

20: 

[[Prov.30.21|21]] For three \[things\] the earth is disquieted, and for four \[which\] it cannot bear:

21: 

[[Prov.30.22|22]] For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;

22: 

[[Prov.30.23|23]] For an odious \[woman\] when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.

23: 

[[Prov.30.24|24]] There be four \[things which are\] little upon the earth, but they \[are\] exceeding wise:

24: 

[[Prov.30.25|25]] The ants \[are\] a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;

25: 

[[Prov.30.26|26]] The conies \[are but\] a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;

26: 

[[Prov.30.27|27]] The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;

27: 

[[Prov.30.28|28]] The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings’ palaces.

28: 

[[Prov.30.29|29]] There be three \[things\] which go well, yea, four are comely in going:

29: 

[[Prov.30.30|30]] A lion \[which is\] strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;

30: 

[[Prov.30.31|31]] A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom \[there is\] no rising up.

31: 

[[Prov.30.32|32]] If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, \[lay\] thine hand upon thy mouth.

32: 

[[Prov.30.33|33]] Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.

33:
