[[Prov.23|Proverbs 23:26 - Proverbs 23:28]]
*Saying 18*

[[Prov.23.26|26]] My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.

26: 

[[Prov.23.27|27]] For a whore \[is\] a deep ditch; and a strange woman \[is\] a narrow pit.

27: 

[[Prov.23.28|28]] She also lieth in wait as \[for\] a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.

28:
