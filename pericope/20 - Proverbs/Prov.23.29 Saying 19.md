[[Prov.23|Proverbs 23:29 - Proverbs 23:35]]
*Saying 19*

[[Prov.23.29|29]] Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?

29: 

[[Prov.23.30|30]] They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.

30: 

[[Prov.23.31|31]] Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, \[when\] it moveth itself aright.

31: 

[[Prov.23.32|32]] At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.

32: 

[[Prov.23.33|33]] Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.

33: 

[[Prov.23.34|34]] Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.

34: 

[[Prov.23.35|35]] They have stricken me, \[shalt thou say, and\] I was not sick; they have beaten me, \[and\] I felt \[it\] not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.

35:
