[[Prov.10|Proverbs 10:1 - Proverbs 10:32]]
*Solomon’s Proverbs：The Wise Son*

[[Prov.10.1|1]] The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son \[is\] the heaviness of his mother.

1: 

[[Prov.10.2|2]] Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.

2: 

[[Prov.10.3|3]] The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.

3: 

[[Prov.10.4|4]] He becometh poor that dealeth \[with\] a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.

4: 

[[Prov.10.5|5]] He that gathereth in summer \[is\] a wise son: \[but\] he that sleepeth in harvest \[is\] a son that causeth shame.

5: 

[[Prov.10.6|6]] Blessings \[are\] upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.

6: 

[[Prov.10.7|7]] The memory of the just \[is\] blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.

7: 

[[Prov.10.8|8]] The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.

8: 

[[Prov.10.9|9]] He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.

9: 

[[Prov.10.10|10]] He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.

10: 

[[Prov.10.11|11]] The mouth of a righteous \[man is\] a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.

11: 

[[Prov.10.12|12]] Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.

12: 

[[Prov.10.13|13]] In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod \[is\] for the back of him that is void of understanding.

13: 

[[Prov.10.14|14]] Wise \[men\] lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish \[is\] near destruction.

14: 

[[Prov.10.15|15]] The rich man’s wealth \[is\] his strong city: the destruction of the poor \[is\] their poverty.

15: 

[[Prov.10.16|16]] The labour of the righteous \[tendeth\] to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin.

16: 

[[Prov.10.17|17]] He \[is in\] the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.

17: 

[[Prov.10.18|18]] He that hideth hatred \[with\] lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, \[is\] a fool.

18: 

[[Prov.10.19|19]] In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips \[is\] wise.

19: 

[[Prov.10.20|20]] The tongue of the just \[is as\] choice silver: the heart of the wicked \[is\] little worth.

20: 

[[Prov.10.21|21]] The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom.

21: 

[[Prov.10.22|22]] The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.

22: 

[[Prov.10.23|23]] \[It is\] as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom.

23: 

[[Prov.10.24|24]] The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.

24: 

[[Prov.10.25|25]] As the whirlwind passeth, so \[is\] the wicked no \[more\]: but the righteous \[is\] an everlasting foundation.

25: 

[[Prov.10.26|26]] As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so \[is\] the sluggard to them that send him.

26: 

[[Prov.10.27|27]] The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.

27: 

[[Prov.10.28|28]] The hope of the righteous \[shall be\] gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.

28: 

[[Prov.10.29|29]] The way of the LORD \[is\] strength to the upright: but destruction \[shall be\] to the workers of iniquity.

29: 

[[Prov.10.30|30]] The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.

30: 

[[Prov.10.31|31]] The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out.

31: 

[[Prov.10.32|32]] The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked \[speaketh\] frowardness.

32:
