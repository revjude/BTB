[[Prov.21|Proverbs 21:1 - Proverbs 21:31]]
*The King’s Heart*

[[Prov.21.1|1]] The king’s heart \[is\] in the hand of the LORD, \[as\] the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.

1: 

[[Prov.21.2|2]] Every way of a man \[is\] right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.

2: 

[[Prov.21.3|3]] To do justice and judgment \[is\] more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.

3: 

[[Prov.21.4|4]] An high look, and a proud heart, \[and\] the plowing of the wicked, \[is\] sin.

4: 

[[Prov.21.5|5]] The thoughts of the diligent \[tend\] only to plenteousness; but of every one \[that is\] hasty only to want.

5: 

[[Prov.21.6|6]] The getting of treasures by a lying tongue \[is\] a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.

6: 

[[Prov.21.7|7]] The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.

7: 

[[Prov.21.8|8]] The way of man \[is\] froward and strange: but \[as for\] the pure, his work \[is\] right.

8: 

[[Prov.21.9|9]] \[It is\] better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.

9: 

[[Prov.21.10|10]] The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.

10: 

[[Prov.21.11|11]] When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.

11: 

[[Prov.21.12|12]] The righteous \[man\] wisely considereth the house of the wicked: \[but God\] overthroweth the wicked for \[their\] wickedness.

12: 

[[Prov.21.13|13]] Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.

13: 

[[Prov.21.14|14]] A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.

14: 

[[Prov.21.15|15]] \[It is\] joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction \[shall be\] to the workers of iniquity.

15: 

[[Prov.21.16|16]] The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.

16: 

[[Prov.21.17|17]] He that loveth pleasure \[shall be\] a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.

17: 

[[Prov.21.18|18]] The wicked \[shall be\] a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.

18: 

[[Prov.21.19|19]] \[It is\] better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.

19: 

[[Prov.21.20|20]] \[There is\] treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.

20: 

[[Prov.21.21|21]] He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.

21: 

[[Prov.21.22|22]] A wise \[man\] scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.

22: 

[[Prov.21.23|23]] Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.

23: 

[[Prov.21.24|24]] Proud \[and\] haughty scorner \[is\] his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.

24: 

[[Prov.21.25|25]] The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.

25: 

[[Prov.21.26|26]] He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.

26: 

[[Prov.21.27|27]] The sacrifice of the wicked \[is\] abomination: how much more, \[when\] he bringeth it with a wicked mind?

27: 

[[Prov.21.28|28]] A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.

28: 

[[Prov.21.29|29]] A wicked man hardeneth his face: but \[as for\] the upright, he directeth his way.

29: 

[[Prov.21.30|30]] \[There is\] no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD.

30: 

[[Prov.21.31|31]] The horse \[is\] prepared against the day of battle: but safety \[is\] of the LORD.

31:
