[[Prov.4|Proverbs 4:1 - Proverbs 4:27]]
*A Father’s Instruction*

[[Prov.4.1|1]] Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.

1: 

[[Prov.4.2|2]] For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.

2: 

[[Prov.4.3|3]] For I was my father’s son, tender and only \[beloved\] in the sight of my mother.

3: 

[[Prov.4.4|4]] He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.

4: 

[[Prov.4.5|5]] Get wisdom, get understanding: forget \[it\] not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.

5: 

[[Prov.4.6|6]] Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.

6: 

[[Prov.4.7|7]] Wisdom \[is\] the principal thing; \[therefore\] get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.

7: 

[[Prov.4.8|8]] Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.

8: 

[[Prov.4.9|9]] She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.

9: 

[[Prov.4.10|10]] Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.

10: 

[[Prov.4.11|11]] I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.

11: 

[[Prov.4.12|12]] When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.

12: 

[[Prov.4.13|13]] Take fast hold of instruction; let \[her\] not go: keep her; for she \[is\] thy life.

13: 

[[Prov.4.14|14]] Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil \[men\].

14: 

[[Prov.4.15|15]] Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.

15: 

[[Prov.4.16|16]] For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause \[some\] to fall.

16: 

[[Prov.4.17|17]] For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.

17: 

[[Prov.4.18|18]] But the path of the just \[is\] as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.

18: 

[[Prov.4.19|19]] The way of the wicked \[is\] as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.

19: 

[[Prov.4.20|20]] My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.

20: 

[[Prov.4.21|21]] Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.

21: 

[[Prov.4.22|22]] For they \[are\] life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.

22: 

[[Prov.4.23|23]] Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it \[are\] the issues of life.

23: 

[[Prov.4.24|24]] Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.

24: 

[[Prov.4.25|25]] Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.

25: 

[[Prov.4.26|26]] Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.

26: 

[[Prov.4.27|27]] Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.

27:
