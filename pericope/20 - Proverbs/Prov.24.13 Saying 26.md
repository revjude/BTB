[[Prov.24.13|13]] My son, eat thou honey, because \[it is\] good; and the honeycomb, \[which is\] sweet to thy taste:

13: 

[[Prov.24.14|14]] So \[shall\] the knowledge of wisdom \[be\] unto thy soul: when thou hast found \[it\], then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.

14:
