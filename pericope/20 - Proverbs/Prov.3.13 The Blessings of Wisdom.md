[[Prov.3|Proverbs 3:13 - Proverbs 3:35]]
*The Blessings of Wisdom*

[[Prov.3.13|13]] Happy \[is\] the man \[that\] findeth wisdom, and the man \[that\] getteth understanding.

13: 

[[Prov.3.14|14]] For the merchandise of it \[is\] better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.

14: 

[[Prov.3.15|15]] She \[is\] more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.

15: 

[[Prov.3.16|16]] Length of days \[is\] in her right hand; \[and\] in her left hand riches and honour.

16: 

[[Prov.3.17|17]] Her ways \[are\] ways of pleasantness, and all her paths \[are\] peace.

17: 

[[Prov.3.18|18]] She \[is\] a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy \[is every one\] that retaineth her.

18: 

[[Prov.3.19|19]] The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.

19: 

[[Prov.3.20|20]] By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.

20: 

[[Prov.3.21|21]] My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:

21: 

[[Prov.3.22|22]] So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.

22: 

[[Prov.3.23|23]] Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.

23: 

[[Prov.3.24|24]] When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.

24: 

[[Prov.3.25|25]] Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.

25: 

[[Prov.3.26|26]] For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.

26: 

[[Prov.3.27|27]] Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do \[it\].

27: 

[[Prov.3.28|28]] Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.

28: 

[[Prov.3.29|29]] Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.

29: 

[[Prov.3.30|30]] Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.

30: 

[[Prov.3.31|31]] Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.

31: 

[[Prov.3.32|32]] For the froward \[is\] abomination to the LORD: but his secret \[is\] with the righteous.

32: 

[[Prov.3.33|33]] The curse of the LORD \[is\] in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.

33: 

[[Prov.3.34|34]] Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.

34: 

[[Prov.3.35|35]] The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.

35:
