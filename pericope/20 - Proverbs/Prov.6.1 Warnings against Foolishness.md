[[Prov.6|Proverbs 6:1 - Proverbs 6:19]]
*Warnings against Foolishness*

[[Prov.6.1|1]] My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, \[if\] thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,

1: 

[[Prov.6.2|2]] Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.

2: 

[[Prov.6.3|3]] Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.

3: 

[[Prov.6.4|4]] Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.

4: 

[[Prov.6.5|5]] Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand \[of the hunter\], and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.

5: 

[[Prov.6.6|6]] Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:

6: 

[[Prov.6.7|7]] Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,

7: 

[[Prov.6.8|8]] Provideth her meat in the summer, \[and\] gathereth her food in the harvest.

8: 

[[Prov.6.9|9]] How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?

9: 

[[Prov.6.10|10]] \[Yet\] a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:

10: 

[[Prov.6.11|11]] So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.

11: 

[[Prov.6.12|12]] A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.

12: 

[[Prov.6.13|13]] He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;

13: 

[[Prov.6.14|14]] Frowardness \[is\] in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.

14: 

[[Prov.6.15|15]] Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.

15: 

[[Prov.6.16|16]] These six \[things\] doth the LORD hate: yea, seven \[are\] an abomination unto him:

16: 

[[Prov.6.17|17]] A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,

17: 

[[Prov.6.18|18]] An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,

18: 

[[Prov.6.19|19]] A false witness \[that\] speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.

19:
