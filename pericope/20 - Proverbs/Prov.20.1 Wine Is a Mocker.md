[[Prov.20|Proverbs 20:1 - Proverbs 20:30]]
*Wine Is a Mocker*

[[Prov.20.1|1]] Wine \[is\] a mocker, strong drink \[is\] raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.

1: 

[[Prov.20.2|2]] The fear of a king \[is\] as the roaring of a lion: \[whoso\] provoketh him to anger sinneth \[against\] his own soul.

2: 

[[Prov.20.3|3]] \[It is\] an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.

3: 

[[Prov.20.4|4]] The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; \[therefore\] shall he beg in harvest, and \[have\] nothing.

4: 

[[Prov.20.5|5]] Counsel in the heart of man \[is like\] deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.

5: 

[[Prov.20.6|6]] Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?

6: 

[[Prov.20.7|7]] The just \[man\] walketh in his integrity: his children \[are\] blessed after him.

7: 

[[Prov.20.8|8]] A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.

8: 

[[Prov.20.9|9]] Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?

9: 

[[Prov.20.10|10]] Divers weights, \[and\] divers measures, both of them \[are\] alike abomination to the LORD.

10: 

[[Prov.20.11|11]] Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work \[be\] pure, and whether \[it be\] right.

11: 

[[Prov.20.12|12]] The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.

12: 

[[Prov.20.13|13]] Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, \[and\] thou shalt be satisfied with bread.

13: 

[[Prov.20.14|14]] \[It is\] naught, \[it is\] naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.

14: 

[[Prov.20.15|15]] There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge \[are\] a precious jewel.

15: 

[[Prov.20.16|16]] Take his garment that is surety \[for\] a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.

16: 

[[Prov.20.17|17]] Bread of deceit \[is\] sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.

17: 

[[Prov.20.18|18]] \[Every\] purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.

18: 

[[Prov.20.19|19]] He that goeth about \[as\] a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.

19: 

[[Prov.20.20|20]] Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.

20: 

[[Prov.20.21|21]] An inheritance \[may be\] gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.

21: 

[[Prov.20.22|22]] Say not thou, I will recompense evil; \[but\] wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.

22: 

[[Prov.20.23|23]] Divers weights \[are\] an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance \[is\] not good.

23: 

[[Prov.20.24|24]] Man’s goings \[are\] of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?

24: 

[[Prov.20.25|25]] \[It is\] a snare to the man \[who\] devoureth \[that which is\] holy, and after vows to make inquiry.

25: 

[[Prov.20.26|26]] A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.

26: 

[[Prov.20.27|27]] The spirit of man \[is\] the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.

27: 

[[Prov.20.28|28]] Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.

28: 

[[Prov.20.29|29]] The glory of young men \[is\] their strength: and the beauty of old men \[is\] the gray head.

29: 

[[Prov.20.30|30]] The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so \[do\] stripes the inward parts of the belly.

30:
