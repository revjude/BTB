[[Jer.52|Jeremiah 52:1 - Jeremiah 52:11]]
*The Fall of Jerusalem Recounted*

[[Jer.52.1|1]] Zedekiah \[was\] one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name \[was\] Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

1: 

[[Jer.52.2|2]] And he did \[that which was\] evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.

2: 

[[Jer.52.3|3]] For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

3: 

[[Jer.52.4|4]] And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth \[day\] of the month, \[that\] Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about.

4: 

[[Jer.52.5|5]] So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.

5: 

[[Jer.52.6|6]] And in the fourth month, in the ninth \[day\] of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.

6: 

[[Jer.52.7|7]] Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which \[was\] by the king’s garden; (now the Chaldeans \[were\] by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.

7: 

[[Jer.52.8|8]] But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.

8: 

[[Jer.52.9|9]] Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.

9: 

[[Jer.52.10|10]] And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.

10: 

[[Jer.52.11|11]] Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.

11:
