[[Jer.16|Jeremiah 16:1 - Jeremiah 16:13]]
*Disaster Predicted*

[[Jer.16.1|1]] The word of the LORD came also unto me, saying,

1: 

[[Jer.16.2|2]] Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place.

2: 

[[Jer.16.3|3]] For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land;

3: 

[[Jer.16.4|4]] They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; \[but\] they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.

4: 

[[Jer.16.5|5]] For thus saith the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith the LORD, \[even\] lovingkindness and mercies.

5: 

[[Jer.16.6|6]] Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall \[men\] lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:

6: 

[[Jer.16.7|7]] Neither shall \[men\] tear \[themselves\] for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall \[men\] give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.

7: 

[[Jer.16.8|8]] Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.

8: 

[[Jer.16.9|9]] For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.

9: 

[[Jer.16.10|10]] And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? or what \[is\] our iniquity? or what \[is\] our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?

10: 

[[Jer.16.11|11]] Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;

11: 

[[Jer.16.12|12]] And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me:

12: 

[[Jer.16.13|13]] Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not, \[neither\] ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; where I will not shew you favour.

13:
