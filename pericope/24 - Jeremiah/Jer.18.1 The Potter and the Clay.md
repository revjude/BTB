[[Jer.18|Jeremiah 18:1 - Jeremiah 18:17]]
*The Potter and the Clay*

[[Jer.18.1|1]] The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

1: 

[[Jer.18.2|2]] Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words.

2: 

[[Jer.18.3|3]] Then I went down to the potter’s house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels.

3: 

[[Jer.18.4|4]] And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make \[it\].

4: 

[[Jer.18.5|5]] Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

5: 

[[Jer.18.6|6]] O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold, as the clay \[is\] in the potter’s hand, so \[are\] ye in mine hand, O house of Israel.

6: 

[[Jer.18.7|7]] \[At what\] instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy \[it\];

7: 

[[Jer.18.8|8]] If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.

8: 

[[Jer.18.9|9]] And \[at what\] instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant \[it\];

9: 

[[Jer.18.10|10]] If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.

10: 

[[Jer.18.11|11]] Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.

11: 

[[Jer.18.12|12]] And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.

12: 

[[Jer.18.13|13]] Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen, who hath heard such things: the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing.

13: 

[[Jer.18.14|14]] Will \[a man\] leave the snow of Lebanon \[which cometh\] from the rock of the field? \[or\] shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?

14: 

[[Jer.18.15|15]] Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways \[from\] the ancient paths, to walk in paths, \[in\] a way not cast up;

15: 

[[Jer.18.16|16]] To make their land desolate, \[and\] a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head.

16: 

[[Jer.18.17|17]] I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.

17:
