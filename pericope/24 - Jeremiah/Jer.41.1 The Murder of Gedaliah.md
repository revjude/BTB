[[Jer.41|Jeremiah 41:1 - Jeremiah 41:10]]
*The Murder of Gedaliah*

[[Jer.41.1|1]] Now it came to pass in the seventh month, \[that\] Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.

1: 

[[Jer.41.2|2]] Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.

2: 

[[Jer.41.3|3]] Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, \[even\] with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, \[and\] the men of war.

3: 

[[Jer.41.4|4]] And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew \[it\],

4: 

[[Jer.41.5|5]] That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, \[even\] fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring \[them\] to the house of the LORD.

5: 

[[Jer.41.6|6]] And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.

6: 

[[Jer.41.7|7]] And it was \[so\], when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, \[and cast them\] into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that \[were\] with him.

7: 

[[Jer.41.8|8]] But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.

8: 

[[Jer.41.9|9]] Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, \[was\] it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: \[and\] Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with \[them that were\] slain.

9: 

[[Jer.41.10|10]] Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that \[were\] in Mizpah, \[even\] the king’s daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.

10:
