[[Jer.16|Jeremiah 16:14 - Jeremiah 16:21]]
*God Will Restore Israel*

[[Jer.16.14|14]] Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be said, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;

14: 

[[Jer.16.15|15]] But, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers.

15: 

[[Jer.16.16|16]] Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.

16: 

[[Jer.16.17|17]] For mine eyes \[are\] upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes.

17: 

[[Jer.16.18|18]] And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things.

18: 

[[Jer.16.19|19]] O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and \[things\] wherein \[there is\] no profit.

19: 

[[Jer.16.20|20]] Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they \[are\] no gods?

20: 

[[Jer.16.21|21]] Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my name \[is\] The LORD.

21:
