[[Jer.35|Jeremiah 35:1 - Jeremiah 35:11]]
*The Obedience of the Rechabites*

[[Jer.35.1|1]] The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,

1: 

[[Jer.35.2|2]] Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.

2: 

[[Jer.35.3|3]] Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;

3: 

[[Jer.35.4|4]] And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which \[was\] by the chamber of the princes, which \[was\] above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:

4: 

[[Jer.35.5|5]] And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.

5: 

[[Jer.35.6|6]] But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, \[neither\] ye, nor your sons for ever:

6: 

[[Jer.35.7|7]] Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have \[any\]: but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye \[be\] strangers.

7: 

[[Jer.35.8|8]] Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;

8: 

[[Jer.35.9|9]] Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:

9: 

[[Jer.35.10|10]] But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.

10: 

[[Jer.35.11|11]] But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.

11:
