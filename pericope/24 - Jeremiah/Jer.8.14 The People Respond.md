[[Jer.8|Jeremiah 8:14 - Jeremiah 8:17]]
*The People Respond*

[[Jer.8.14|14]] Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.

14: 

[[Jer.8.15|15]] We looked for peace, but no good \[came; and\] for a time of health, and behold trouble!

15: 

[[Jer.8.16|16]] The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein.

16: 

[[Jer.8.17|17]] For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which \[will\] not \[be\] charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the LORD.

17:
