[[Jer.40|Jeremiah 40:7 - Jeremiah 40:12]]
*Gedaliah Governs in Judah*

[[Jer.40.7|7]] Now when all the captains of the forces which \[were\] in the fields, \[even\] they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;

7: 

[[Jer.40.8|8]] Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.

8: 

[[Jer.40.9|9]] And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.

9: 

[[Jer.40.10|10]] As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put \[them\] in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.

10: 

[[Jer.40.11|11]] Likewise when all the Jews that \[were\] in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that \[were\] in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;

11: 

[[Jer.40.12|12]] Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.

12:
