[[Jer.37|Jeremiah 37:1 - Jeremiah 37:10]]
*Jeremiah Warns Zedekiah*

[[Jer.37.1|1]] And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.

1: 

[[Jer.37.2|2]] But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah.

2: 

[[Jer.37.3|3]] And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us.

3: 

[[Jer.37.4|4]] Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison.

4: 

[[Jer.37.5|5]] Then Pharaoh’s army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.

5: 

[[Jer.37.6|6]] Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying,

6: 

[[Jer.37.7|7]] Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to inquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.

7: 

[[Jer.37.8|8]] And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.

8: 

[[Jer.37.9|9]] Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.

9: 

[[Jer.37.10|10]] For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained \[but\] wounded men among them, \[yet\] should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.

10:
