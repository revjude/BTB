[[Jer.8|Jeremiah 8:1 - Jeremiah 8:13]]
*Judah’s Sin and Punishment*

[[Jer.8.1|1]] At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves:

1: 

[[Jer.8.2|2]] And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.

2: 

[[Jer.8.3|3]] And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the LORD of hosts.

3: 

[[Jer.8.4|4]] Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return?

4: 

[[Jer.8.5|5]] Why \[then\] is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.

5: 

[[Jer.8.6|6]] I hearkened and heard, \[but\] they spake not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle.

6: 

[[Jer.8.7|7]] Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.

7: 

[[Jer.8.8|8]] How do ye say, We \[are\] wise, and the law of the LORD \[is\] with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he \[it\]; the pen of the scribes \[is\] in vain.

8: 

[[Jer.8.9|9]] The wise \[men\] are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom \[is\] in them?

9: 

[[Jer.8.10|10]] Therefore will I give their wives unto others, \[and\] their fields to them that shall inherit \[them\]: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.

10: 

[[Jer.8.11|11]] For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when \[there is\] no peace.

11: 

[[Jer.8.12|12]] Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.

12: 

[[Jer.8.13|13]] I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: \[there shall be\] no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and \[the things that\] I have given them shall pass away from them.

13:
