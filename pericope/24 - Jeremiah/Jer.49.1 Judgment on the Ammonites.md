[[Jer.49|Jeremiah 49:1 - Jeremiah 49:6]]
*Judgment on the Ammonites*

[[Jer.49.1|1]] Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why \[then\] doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?

1: 

[[Jer.49.2|2]] Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.

2: 

[[Jer.49.3|3]] Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, \[and\] his priests and his princes together.

3: 

[[Jer.49.4|4]] Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, \[saying\], Who shall come unto me?

4: 

[[Jer.49.5|5]] Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.

5: 

[[Jer.49.6|6]] And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD.

6:
