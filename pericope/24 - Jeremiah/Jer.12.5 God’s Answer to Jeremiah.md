[[Jer.12|Jeremiah 12:5 - Jeremiah 12:13]]
*God’s Answer to Jeremiah*

[[Jer.12.5|5]] If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and \[if\] in the land of peace, \[wherein\] thou trustedst, \[they wearied thee\], then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?

5: 

[[Jer.12.6|6]] For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.

6: 

[[Jer.12.7|7]] I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.

7: 

[[Jer.12.8|8]] Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it.

8: 

[[Jer.12.9|9]] Mine heritage \[is\] unto me \[as\] a speckled bird, the birds round about \[are\] against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.

9: 

[[Jer.12.10|10]] Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.

10: 

[[Jer.12.11|11]] They have made it desolate, \[and being\] desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth \[it\] to heart.

11: 

[[Jer.12.12|12]] The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the \[one\] end of the land even to the \[other\] end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.

12: 

[[Jer.12.13|13]] They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, \[but\] shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.

13:
