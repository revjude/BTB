[[Jer.13|Jeremiah 13:1 - Jeremiah 13:11]]
*The Linen Loincloth*

[[Jer.13.1|1]] Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.

1: 

[[Jer.13.2|2]] So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put \[it\] on my loins.

2: 

[[Jer.13.3|3]] And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,

3: 

[[Jer.13.4|4]] Take the girdle that thou hast got, which \[is\] upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.

4: 

[[Jer.13.5|5]] So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.

5: 

[[Jer.13.6|6]] And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.

6: 

[[Jer.13.7|7]] Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.

7: 

[[Jer.13.8|8]] Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

8: 

[[Jer.13.9|9]] Thus saith the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.

9: 

[[Jer.13.10|10]] This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing.

10: 

[[Jer.13.11|11]] For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the LORD; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.

11:
