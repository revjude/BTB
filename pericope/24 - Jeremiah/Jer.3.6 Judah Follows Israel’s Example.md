[[Jer.3|Jeremiah 3:6 - Jeremiah 3:10]]
*Judah Follows Israel’s Example*

[[Jer.3.6|6]] The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen \[that\] which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot.

6: 

[[Jer.3.7|7]] And I said after she had done all these \[things\], Turn thou unto me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw \[it\].

7: 

[[Jer.3.8|8]] And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.

8: 

[[Jer.3.9|9]] And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.

9: 

[[Jer.3.10|10]] And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD.

10:
