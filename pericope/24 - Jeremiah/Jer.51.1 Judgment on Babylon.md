[[Jer.51|Jeremiah 51:1 - Jeremiah 51:14]]
*Judgment on Babylon*

[[Jer.51.1|1]] Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind;

1: 

[[Jer.51.2|2]] And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.

2: 

[[Jer.51.3|3]] Against \[him that\] bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against \[him that\] lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host.

3: 

[[Jer.51.4|4]] Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and \[they that are\] thrust through in her streets.

4: 

[[Jer.51.5|5]] For Israel \[hath\] not \[been\] forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.

5: 

[[Jer.51.6|6]] Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this \[is\] the time of the LORD’S vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.

6: 

[[Jer.51.7|7]] Babylon \[hath been\] a golden cup in the LORD’S hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.

7: 

[[Jer.51.8|8]] Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.

8: 

[[Jer.51.9|9]] We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up \[even\] to the skies.

9: 

[[Jer.51.10|10]] The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.

10: 

[[Jer.51.11|11]] Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device \[is\] against Babylon, to destroy it; because it \[is\] the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple.

11: 

[[Jer.51.12|12]] Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon.

12: 

[[Jer.51.13|13]] O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, \[and\] the measure of thy covetousness.

13: 

[[Jer.51.14|14]] The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, \[saying\], Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a shout against thee.

14:
