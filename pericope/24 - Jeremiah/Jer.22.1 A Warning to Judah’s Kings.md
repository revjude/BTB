[[Jer.22|Jeremiah 22:1 - Jeremiah 22:5]]
*A Warning to Judah’s Kings*

[[Jer.22.1|1]] Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,

1: 

[[Jer.22.2|2]] And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates:

2: 

[[Jer.22.3|3]] Thus saith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place.

3: 

[[Jer.22.4|4]] For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.

4: 

[[Jer.22.5|5]] But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation.

5:
