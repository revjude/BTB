[[Jer.9|Jeremiah 9:1 - Jeremiah 9:26]]
*A Lament over Zion*

[[Jer.9.1|1]] Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!

1: 

[[Jer.9.2|2]] Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they \[be\] all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.

2: 

[[Jer.9.3|3]] And they bend their tongues \[like\] their bow \[for\] lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD.

3: 

[[Jer.9.4|4]] Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders.

4: 

[[Jer.9.5|5]] And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, \[and\] weary themselves to commit iniquity.

5: 

[[Jer.9.6|6]] Thine habitation \[is\] in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD.

6: 

[[Jer.9.7|7]] Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?

7: 

[[Jer.9.8|8]] Their tongue \[is as\] an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: \[one\] speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait.

8: 

[[Jer.9.9|9]] Shall I not visit them for these \[things\]? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?

9: 

[[Jer.9.10|10]] For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through \[them\]; neither can \[men\] hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.

10: 

[[Jer.9.11|11]] And I will make Jerusalem heaps, \[and\] a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.

11: 

[[Jer.9.12|12]] Who \[is\] the wise man, that may understand this? and \[who is he\] to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth \[and\] is burned up like a wilderness, that none passeth through?

12: 

[[Jer.9.13|13]] And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein;

13: 

[[Jer.9.14|14]] But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them:

14: 

[[Jer.9.15|15]] Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, \[even\] this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.

15: 

[[Jer.9.16|16]] I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.

16: 

[[Jer.9.17|17]] Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning \[women\], that they may come:

17: 

[[Jer.9.18|18]] And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.

18: 

[[Jer.9.19|19]] For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast \[us\] out.

19: 

[[Jer.9.20|20]] Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation.

20: 

[[Jer.9.21|21]] For death is come up into our windows, \[and\] is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, \[and\] the young men from the streets.

21: 

[[Jer.9.22|22]] Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather \[them\].

22: 

[[Jer.9.23|23]] Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise \[man\] glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty \[man\] glory in his might, let not the rich \[man\] glory in his riches:

23: 

[[Jer.9.24|24]] But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I \[am\] the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these \[things\] I delight, saith the LORD.

24: 

[[Jer.9.25|25]] Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all \[them which are\] circumcised with the uncircumcised;

25: 

[[Jer.9.26|26]] Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all \[that are\] in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all \[these\] nations \[are\] uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel \[are\] uncircumcised in the heart.

26:
