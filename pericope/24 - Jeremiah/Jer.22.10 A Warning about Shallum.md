[[Jer.22|Jeremiah 22:10 - Jeremiah 22:12]]
*A Warning about Shallum*

[[Jer.22.10|10]] Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: \[but\] weep sore for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.

10: 

[[Jer.22.11|11]] For thus saith the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which went forth out of this place; He shall not return thither any more:

11: 

[[Jer.22.12|12]] But he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more.

12:
