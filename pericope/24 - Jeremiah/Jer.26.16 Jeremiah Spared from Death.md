[[Jer.26|Jeremiah 26:16 - Jeremiah 26:19]]
*Jeremiah Spared from Death*

[[Jer.26.16|16]] Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man \[is\] not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.

16: 

[[Jer.26.17|17]] Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,

17: 

[[Jer.26.18|18]] Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed \[like\] a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.

18: 

[[Jer.26.19|19]] Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.

19:
