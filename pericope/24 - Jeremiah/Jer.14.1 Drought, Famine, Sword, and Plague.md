[[Jer.14|Jeremiah 14:1 - Jeremiah 14:18]]
*Drought, Famine, Sword, and Plague*

[[Jer.14.1|1]] The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth.

1: 

[[Jer.14.2|2]] Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.

2: 

[[Jer.14.3|3]] And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, \[and\] found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.

3: 

[[Jer.14.4|4]] Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.

4: 

[[Jer.14.5|5]] Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook \[it\], because there was no grass.

5: 

[[Jer.14.6|6]] And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because \[there was\] no grass.

6: 

[[Jer.14.7|7]] O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou \[it\] for thy name’s sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.

7: 

[[Jer.14.8|8]] O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man \[that\] turneth aside to tarry for a night?

8: 

[[Jer.14.9|9]] Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man \[that\] cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, \[art\] in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.

9: 

[[Jer.14.10|10]] Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.

10: 

[[Jer.14.11|11]] Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for \[their\] good.

11: 

[[Jer.14.12|12]] When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.

12: 

[[Jer.14.13|13]] Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.

13: 

[[Jer.14.14|14]] Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.

14: 

[[Jer.14.15|15]] Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.

15: 

[[Jer.14.16|16]] And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.

16: 

[[Jer.14.17|17]] Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.

17: 

[[Jer.14.18|18]] If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.

18:
