[[Jer.2|Jeremiah 2:23 - Jeremiah 2:37]]
*Israel’s Unfaithfulness*

[[Jer.2.23|23]] How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: \[thou art\] a swift dromedary traversing her ways;

23: 

[[Jer.2.24|24]] A wild ass used to the wilderness, \[that\] snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.

24: 

[[Jer.2.25|25]] Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.

25: 

[[Jer.2.26|26]] As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,

26: 

[[Jer.2.27|27]] Saying to a stock, Thou \[art\] my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned \[their\] back unto me, and not \[their\] face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.

27: 

[[Jer.2.28|28]] But where \[are\] thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for \[according to\] the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.

28: 

[[Jer.2.29|29]] Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the LORD.

29: 

[[Jer.2.30|30]] In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.

30: 

[[Jer.2.31|31]] O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?

31: 

[[Jer.2.32|32]] Can a maid forget her ornaments, \[or\] a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.

32: 

[[Jer.2.33|33]] Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways.

33: 

[[Jer.2.34|34]] Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.

34: 

[[Jer.2.35|35]] Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.

35: 

[[Jer.2.36|36]] Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.

36: 

[[Jer.2.37|37]] Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.

37:
