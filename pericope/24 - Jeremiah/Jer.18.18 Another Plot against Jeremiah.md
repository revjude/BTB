[[Jer.18|Jeremiah 18:18 - Jeremiah 18:23]]
*Another Plot against Jeremiah*

[[Jer.18.18|18]] Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.

18: 

[[Jer.18.19|19]] Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.

19: 

[[Jer.18.20|20]] Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, \[and\] to turn away thy wrath from them.

20: 

[[Jer.18.21|21]] Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their \[blood\] by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and \[be\] widows; and let their men be put to death; \[let\] their young men \[be\] slain by the sword in battle.

21: 

[[Jer.18.22|22]] Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.

22: 

[[Jer.18.23|23]] Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay \[me\]: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal \[thus\] with them in the time of thine anger.

23:
