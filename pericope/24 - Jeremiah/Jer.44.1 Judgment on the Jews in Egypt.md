[[Jer.44|Jeremiah 44:1 - Jeremiah 44:14]]
*Judgment on the Jews in Egypt*

[[Jer.44.1|1]] The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,

1: 

[[Jer.44.2|2]] Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they \[are\] a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,

2: 

[[Jer.44.3|3]] Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, \[and\] to serve other gods, whom they knew not, \[neither\] they, ye, nor your fathers.

3: 

[[Jer.44.4|4]] Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending \[them\], saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.

4: 

[[Jer.44.5|5]] But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.

5: 

[[Jer.44.6|6]] Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted \[and\] desolate, as at this day.

6: 

[[Jer.44.7|7]] Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye \[this\] great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;

7: 

[[Jer.44.8|8]] In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?

8: 

[[Jer.44.9|9]] Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?

9: 

[[Jer.44.10|10]] They are not humbled \[even\] unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.

10: 

[[Jer.44.11|11]] Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.

11: 

[[Jer.44.12|12]] And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, \[and\] fall in the land of Egypt; they shall \[even\] be consumed by the sword \[and\] by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, \[and\] an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.

12: 

[[Jer.44.13|13]] For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:

13: 

[[Jer.44.14|14]] So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.

14:
