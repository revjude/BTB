[[Jer.37|Jeremiah 37:11 - Jeremiah 37:21]]
*Jeremiah Imprisoned*

[[Jer.37.11|11]] And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army,

11: 

[[Jer.37.12|12]] Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people.

12: 

[[Jer.37.13|13]] And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward \[was\] there, whose name \[was\] Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.

13: 

[[Jer.37.14|14]] Then said Jeremiah, \[It is\] false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.

14: 

[[Jer.37.15|15]] Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.

15: 

[[Jer.37.16|16]] When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;

16: 

[[Jer.37.17|17]] Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there \[any\] word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.

17: 

[[Jer.37.18|18]] Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?

18: 

[[Jer.37.19|19]] Where \[are\] now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?

19: 

[[Jer.37.20|20]] Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.

20: 

[[Jer.37.21|21]] Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.

21:
