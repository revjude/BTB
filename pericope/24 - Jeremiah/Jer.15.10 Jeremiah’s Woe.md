[[Jer.15|Jeremiah 15:10 - Jeremiah 15:18]]
*Jeremiah’s Woe*

[[Jer.15.10|10]] Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; \[yet\] every one of them doth curse me.

10: 

[[Jer.15.11|11]] The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee \[well\] in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.

11: 

[[Jer.15.12|12]] Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?

12: 

[[Jer.15.13|13]] Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and \[that\] for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.

13: 

[[Jer.15.14|14]] And I will make \[thee\] to pass with thine enemies into a land \[which\] thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, \[which\] shall burn upon you.

14: 

[[Jer.15.15|15]] O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.

15: 

[[Jer.15.16|16]] Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.

16: 

[[Jer.15.17|17]] I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.

17: 

[[Jer.15.18|18]] Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, \[which\] refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, \[and as\] waters \[that\] fail?

18:
