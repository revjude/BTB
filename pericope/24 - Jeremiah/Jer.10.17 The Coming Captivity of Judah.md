[[Jer.10|Jeremiah 10:17 - Jeremiah 10:25]]
*The Coming Captivity of Judah*

[[Jer.10.17|17]] Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.

17: 

[[Jer.10.18|18]] For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find \[it so\].

18: 

[[Jer.10.19|19]] Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this \[is\] a grief, and I must bear it.

19: 

[[Jer.10.20|20]] My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they \[are\] not: \[there is\] none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.

20: 

[[Jer.10.21|21]] For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.

21: 

[[Jer.10.22|22]] Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, \[and\] a den of dragons.

22: 

[[Jer.10.23|23]] O LORD, I know that the way of man \[is\] not in himself: \[it is\] not in man that walketh to direct his steps.

23: 

[[Jer.10.24|24]] O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.

24: 

[[Jer.10.25|25]] Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.

25:
