[[Jer.12|Jeremiah 12:1 - Jeremiah 12:4]]
*The Prosperity of the Wicked*

[[Jer.12.1|1]] Righteous \[art\] thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of \[thy\] judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? \[wherefore\] are all they happy that deal very treacherously?

1: 

[[Jer.12.2|2]] Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou \[art\] near in their mouth, and far from their reins.

2: 

[[Jer.12.3|3]] But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.

3: 

[[Jer.12.4|4]] How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.

4:
