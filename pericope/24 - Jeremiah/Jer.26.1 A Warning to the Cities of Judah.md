[[Jer.26|Jeremiah 26:1 - Jeremiah 26:6]]
*A Warning to the Cities of Judah*

[[Jer.26.1|1]] In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying,

1: 

[[Jer.26.2|2]] Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD’S house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD’S house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word:

2: 

[[Jer.26.3|3]] If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.

3: 

[[Jer.26.4|4]] And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,

4: 

[[Jer.26.5|5]] To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending \[them\], but ye have not hearkened;

5: 

[[Jer.26.6|6]] Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.

6:
