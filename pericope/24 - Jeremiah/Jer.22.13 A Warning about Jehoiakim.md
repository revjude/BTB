[[Jer.22|Jeremiah 22:13 - Jeremiah 22:23]]
*A Warning about Jehoiakim*

[[Jer.22.13|13]] Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; \[that\] useth his neighbour’s service without wages, and giveth him not for his work;

13: 

[[Jer.22.14|14]] That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and \[it is\] cieled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.

14: 

[[Jer.22.15|15]] Shalt thou reign, because thou closest \[thyself\] in cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, \[and\] then \[it was\] well with him?

15: 

[[Jer.22.16|16]] He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then \[it was\] well \[with him: was\] not this to know me? saith the LORD.

16: 

[[Jer.22.17|17]] But thine eyes and thine heart \[are\] not but for thy covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do \[it\].

17: 

[[Jer.22.18|18]] Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, \[saying\], Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, \[saying\], Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!

18: 

[[Jer.22.19|19]] He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.

19: 

[[Jer.22.20|20]] Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed.

20: 

[[Jer.22.21|21]] I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; \[but\] thou saidst, I will not hear. This \[hath been\] thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice.

21: 

[[Jer.22.22|22]] The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.

22: 

[[Jer.22.23|23]] O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!

23:
