[[Jer.12|Jeremiah 12:14 - Jeremiah 12:17]]
*A Message for Israel’s Neighbors*

[[Jer.12.14|14]] Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.

14: 

[[Jer.12.15|15]] And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.

15: 

[[Jer.12.16|16]] And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people.

16: 

[[Jer.12.17|17]] But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the LORD.

17:
