[[Jer.50|Jeremiah 50:4 - Jeremiah 50:10]]
*Hope for Israel and Judah*

[[Jer.50.4|4]] In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.

4: 

[[Jer.50.5|5]] They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, \[saying\], Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant \[that\] shall not be forgotten.

5: 

[[Jer.50.6|6]] My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away \[on\] the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.

6: 

[[Jer.50.7|7]] All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.

7: 

[[Jer.50.8|8]] Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.

8: 

[[Jer.50.9|9]] For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows \[shall be\] as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.

9: 

[[Jer.50.10|10]] And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD.

10:
