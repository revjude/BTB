[[Jer.34|Jeremiah 34:1 - Jeremiah 34:7]]
*A Prophecy against Zedekiah*

[[Jer.34.1|1]] The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,

1: 

[[Jer.34.2|2]] Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:

2: 

[[Jer.34.3|3]] And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.

3: 

[[Jer.34.4|4]] Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:

4: 

[[Jer.34.5|5]] \[But\] thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn \[odours\] for thee; and they will lament thee, \[saying\], Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD.

5: 

[[Jer.34.6|6]] Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,

6: 

[[Jer.34.7|7]] When the king of Babylon’s army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah.

7:
