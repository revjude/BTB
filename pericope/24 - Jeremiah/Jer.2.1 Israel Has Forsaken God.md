[[Jer.2|Jeremiah 2:1 - Jeremiah 2:13]]
*Israel Has Forsaken God*

[[Jer.2.1|1]] Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

1: 

[[Jer.2.2|2]] Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land \[that was\] not sown.

2: 

[[Jer.2.3|3]] Israel \[was\] holiness unto the LORD, \[and\] the firstfruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, saith the LORD.

3: 

[[Jer.2.4|4]] Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:

4: 

[[Jer.2.5|5]] Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?

5: 

[[Jer.2.6|6]] Neither said they, Where \[is\] the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?

6: 

[[Jer.2.7|7]] And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.

7: 

[[Jer.2.8|8]] The priests said not, Where \[is\] the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after \[things that\] do not profit.

8: 

[[Jer.2.9|9]] Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your children’s children will I plead.

9: 

[[Jer.2.10|10]] For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.

10: 

[[Jer.2.11|11]] Hath a nation changed \[their\] gods, which \[are\] yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for \[that which\] doth not profit.

11: 

[[Jer.2.12|12]] Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the LORD.

12: 

[[Jer.2.13|13]] For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, \[and\] hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.

13:
