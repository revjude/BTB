[[Jer.13|Jeremiah 13:15 - Jeremiah 13:27]]
*Captivity Threatened*

[[Jer.13.15|15]] Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken.

15: 

[[Jer.13.16|16]] Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, \[and\] make \[it\] gross darkness.

16: 

[[Jer.13.17|17]] But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for \[your\] pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the LORD’S flock is carried away captive.

17: 

[[Jer.13.18|18]] Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, \[even\] the crown of your glory.

18: 

[[Jer.13.19|19]] The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open \[them\]: Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be wholly carried away captive.

19: 

[[Jer.13.20|20]] Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where \[is\] the flock \[that\] was given thee, thy beautiful flock?

20: 

[[Jer.13.21|21]] What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them \[to be\] captains, \[and\] as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?

21: 

[[Jer.13.22|22]] And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, \[and\] thy heels made bare.

22: 

[[Jer.13.23|23]] Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? \[then\] may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.

23: 

[[Jer.13.24|24]] Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness.

24: 

[[Jer.13.25|25]] This \[is\] thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.

25: 

[[Jer.13.26|26]] Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear.

26: 

[[Jer.13.27|27]] I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, \[and\] thine abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when \[shall it\] once \[be\]?

27:
