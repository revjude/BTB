[[Jer.49|Jeremiah 49:23 - Jeremiah 49:27]]
*Judgment on Damascus*

[[Jer.49.23|23]] Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; \[there is\] sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.

23: 

[[Jer.49.24|24]] Damascus is waxed feeble, \[and\] turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on \[her\]: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.

24: 

[[Jer.49.25|25]] How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!

25: 

[[Jer.49.26|26]] Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.

26: 

[[Jer.49.27|27]] And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad.

27:
