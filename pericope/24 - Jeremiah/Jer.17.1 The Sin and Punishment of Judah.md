[[Jer.17|Jeremiah 17:1 - Jeremiah 17:11]]
*The Sin and Punishment of Judah*

[[Jer.17.1|1]] The sin of Judah \[is\] written with a pen of iron, \[and\] with the point of a diamond: \[it is\] graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars;

1: 

[[Jer.17.2|2]] Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills.

2: 

[[Jer.17.3|3]] O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance \[and\] all thy treasures to the spoil, \[and\] thy high places for sin, throughout all thy borders.

3: 

[[Jer.17.4|4]] And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, \[which\] shall burn for ever.

4: 

[[Jer.17.5|5]] Thus saith the LORD; Cursed \[be\] the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD.

5: 

[[Jer.17.6|6]] For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, \[in\] a salt land and not inhabited.

6: 

[[Jer.17.7|7]] Blessed \[is\] the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is.

7: 

[[Jer.17.8|8]] For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and \[that\] spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.

8: 

[[Jer.17.9|9]] The heart \[is\] deceitful above all \[things\], and desperately wicked: who can know it?

9: 

[[Jer.17.10|10]] I the LORD search the heart, \[I\] try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, \[and\] according to the fruit of his doings.

10: 

[[Jer.17.11|11]] \[As\] the partridge sitteth \[on eggs\], and hatcheth \[them\] not; \[so\] he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.

11:
