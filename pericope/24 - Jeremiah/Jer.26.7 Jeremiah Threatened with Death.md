[[Jer.26|Jeremiah 26:7 - Jeremiah 26:15]]
*Jeremiah Threatened with Death*

[[Jer.26.7|7]] So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.

7: 

[[Jer.26.8|8]] Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded \[him\] to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.

8: 

[[Jer.26.9|9]] Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.

9: 

[[Jer.26.10|10]] When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king’s house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD’S \[house\].

10: 

[[Jer.26.11|11]] Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man \[is\] worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.

11: 

[[Jer.26.12|12]] Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.

12: 

[[Jer.26.13|13]] Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.

13: 

[[Jer.26.14|14]] As for me, behold, I \[am\] in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you.

14: 

[[Jer.26.15|15]] But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.

15:
