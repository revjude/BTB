[[Jer.51|Jeremiah 51:15 - Jeremiah 51:19]]
*Praise to the God of Jacob*

[[Jer.51.15|15]] He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding.

15: 

[[Jer.51.16|16]] When he uttereth \[his\] voice, \[there is\] a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.

16: 

[[Jer.51.17|17]] Every man is brutish by \[his\] knowledge; every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image \[is\] falsehood, and \[there is\] no breath in them.

17: 

[[Jer.51.18|18]] They \[are\] vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.

18: 

[[Jer.51.19|19]] The portion of Jacob \[is\] not like them; for he \[is\] the former of all things: and \[Israel is\] the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts \[is\] his name.

19:
