[[Jer.49|Jeremiah 49:34 - Jeremiah 49:39]]
*Judgment on Elam*

[[Jer.49.34|34]] The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,

34: 

[[Jer.49.35|35]] Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.

35: 

[[Jer.49.36|36]] And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.

36: 

[[Jer.49.37|37]] For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, \[even\] my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:

37: 

[[Jer.49.38|38]] And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD.

38: 

[[Jer.49.39|39]] But it shall come to pass in the latter days, \[that\] I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.

39:
