[[Jer.32|Jeremiah 32:16 - Jeremiah 32:25]]
*Jeremiah Prays for Understanding*

[[Jer.32.16|16]] Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying,

16: 

[[Jer.32.17|17]] Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, \[and\] there is nothing too hard for thee:

17: 

[[Jer.32.18|18]] Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, \[is\] his name,

18: 

[[Jer.32.19|19]] Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes \[are\] open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:

19: 

[[Jer.32.20|20]] Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, \[even\] unto this day, and in Israel, and among \[other\] men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day;

20: 

[[Jer.32.21|21]] And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;

21: 

[[Jer.32.22|22]] And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;

22: 

[[Jer.32.23|23]] And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:

23: 

[[Jer.32.24|24]] Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest \[it\].

24: 

[[Jer.32.25|25]] And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.

25:
