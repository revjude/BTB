[[Jer.5|Jeremiah 5:1 - Jeremiah 5:13]]
*No One Is Just*

[[Jer.5.1|1]] Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be \[any\] that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it.

1: 

[[Jer.5.2|2]] And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely.

2: 

[[Jer.5.3|3]] O LORD, \[are\] not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, \[but\] they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.

3: 

[[Jer.5.4|4]] Therefore I said, Surely these \[are\] poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the LORD, \[nor\] the judgment of their God.

4: 

[[Jer.5.5|5]] I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the LORD, \[and\] the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, \[and\] burst the bonds.

5: 

[[Jer.5.6|6]] Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, \[and\] a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, \[and\] their backslidings are increased.

6: 

[[Jer.5.7|7]] How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by \[them that are\] no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots’ houses.

7: 

[[Jer.5.8|8]] They were \[as\] fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour’s wife.

8: 

[[Jer.5.9|9]] Shall I not visit for these \[things\]? saith the LORD: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?

9: 

[[Jer.5.10|10]] Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they \[are\] not the LORD’S.

10: 

[[Jer.5.11|11]] For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the LORD.

11: 

[[Jer.5.12|12]] They have belied the LORD, and said, \[It is\] not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:

12: 

[[Jer.5.13|13]] And the prophets shall become wind, and the word \[is\] not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.

13:
