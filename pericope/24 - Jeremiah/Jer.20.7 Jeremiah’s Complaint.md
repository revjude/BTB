[[Jer.20|Jeremiah 20:7 - Jeremiah 20:18]]
*Jeremiah’s Complaint*

[[Jer.20.7|7]] O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me.

7: 

[[Jer.20.8|8]] For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily.

8: 

[[Jer.20.9|9]] Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But \[his word\] was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not \[stay\].

9: 

[[Jer.20.10|10]] For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, \[say they\], and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, \[saying\], Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.

10: 

[[Jer.20.11|11]] But the LORD \[is\] with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: \[their\] everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.

11: 

[[Jer.20.12|12]] But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, \[and\] seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I opened my cause.

12: 

[[Jer.20.13|13]] Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.

13: 

[[Jer.20.14|14]] Cursed \[be\] the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.

14: 

[[Jer.20.15|15]] Cursed \[be\] the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad.

15: 

[[Jer.20.16|16]] And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noontide;

16: 

[[Jer.20.17|17]] Because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb \[to be\] always great \[with me\].

17: 

[[Jer.20.18|18]] Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?

18:
