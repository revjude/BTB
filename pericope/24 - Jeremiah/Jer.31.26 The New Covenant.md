[[Jer.31|Jeremiah 31:26 - Jeremiah 31:40]]
*The New Covenant*

[[Jer.31.26|26]] Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.

26: 

[[Jer.31.27|27]] Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.

27: 

[[Jer.31.28|28]] And it shall come to pass, \[that\] like as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the LORD.

28: 

[[Jer.31.29|29]] In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.

29: 

[[Jer.31.30|30]] But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.

30: 

[[Jer.31.31|31]] Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:

31: 

[[Jer.31.32|32]] Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day \[that\] I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD:

32: 

[[Jer.31.33|33]] But this \[shall be\] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.

33: 

[[Jer.31.34|34]] And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.

34: 

[[Jer.31.35|35]] Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day, \[and\] the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts \[is\] his name:

35: 

[[Jer.31.36|36]] If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, \[then\] the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.

36: 

[[Jer.31.37|37]] Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD.

37: 

[[Jer.31.38|38]] Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner.

38: 

[[Jer.31.39|39]] And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.

39: 

[[Jer.31.40|40]] And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, \[shall be\] holy unto the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.

40:
