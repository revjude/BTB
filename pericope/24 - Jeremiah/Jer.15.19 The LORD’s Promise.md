[[Jer.15|Jeremiah 15:19 - Jeremiah 15:21]]
*The LORD’s Promise*

[[Jer.15.19|19]] Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, \[and\] thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.

19: 

[[Jer.15.20|20]] And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I \[am\] with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD.

20: 

[[Jer.15.21|21]] And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.

21:
