[[Jer.23|Jeremiah 23:9 - Jeremiah 23:32]]
*Lying Prophets*

[[Jer.23.9|9]] Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holiness.

9: 

[[Jer.23.10|10]] For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force \[is\] not right.

10: 

[[Jer.23.11|11]] For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the LORD.

11: 

[[Jer.23.12|12]] Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery \[ways\] in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them, \[even\] the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.

12: 

[[Jer.23.13|13]] And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.

13: 

[[Jer.23.14|14]] I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.

14: 

[[Jer.23.15|15]] Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land.

15: 

[[Jer.23.16|16]] Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, \[and\] not out of the mouth of the LORD.

16: 

[[Jer.23.17|17]] They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.

17: 

[[Jer.23.18|18]] For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard \[it\]?

18: 

[[Jer.23.19|19]] Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked.

19: 

[[Jer.23.20|20]] The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly.

20: 

[[Jer.23.21|21]] I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.

21: 

[[Jer.23.22|22]] But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.

22: 

[[Jer.23.23|23]] \[Am\] I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off?

23: 

[[Jer.23.24|24]] Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD.

24: 

[[Jer.23.25|25]] I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.

25: 

[[Jer.23.26|26]] How long shall \[this\] be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, \[they are\] prophets of the deceit of their own heart;

26: 

[[Jer.23.27|27]] Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.

27: 

[[Jer.23.28|28]] The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What \[is\] the chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD.

28: 

[[Jer.23.29|29]] \[Is\] not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a hammer \[that\] breaketh the rock in pieces?

29: 

[[Jer.23.30|30]] Therefore, behold, I \[am\] against the prophets, saith the LORD, that steal my words every one from his neighbour.

30: 

[[Jer.23.31|31]] Behold, I \[am\] against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He saith.

31: 

[[Jer.23.32|32]] Behold, I \[am\] against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the LORD.

32:
