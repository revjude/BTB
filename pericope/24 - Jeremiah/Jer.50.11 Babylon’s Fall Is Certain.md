[[Jer.50|Jeremiah 50:11 - Jeremiah 50:16]]
*Babylon’s Fall Is Certain*

[[Jer.50.11|11]] Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;

11: 

[[Jer.50.12|12]] Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations \[shall be\] a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.

12: 

[[Jer.50.13|13]] Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.

13: 

[[Jer.50.14|14]] Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD.

14: 

[[Jer.50.15|15]] Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it \[is\] the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.

15: 

[[Jer.50.16|16]] Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.

16:
