[[Jer.4|Jeremiah 4:19 - Jeremiah 4:31]]
*Lamentation for Judah*

[[Jer.4.19|19]] My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.

19: 

[[Jer.4.20|20]] Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, \[and\] my curtains in a moment.

20: 

[[Jer.4.21|21]] How long shall I see the standard, \[and\] hear the sound of the trumpet?

21: 

[[Jer.4.22|22]] For my people \[is\] foolish, they have not known me; they \[are\] sottish children, and they have none understanding: they \[are\] wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.

22: 

[[Jer.4.23|23]] I beheld the earth, and, lo, \[it was\] without form, and void; and the heavens, and they \[had\] no light.

23: 

[[Jer.4.24|24]] I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.

24: 

[[Jer.4.25|25]] I beheld, and, lo, \[there was\] no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.

25: 

[[Jer.4.26|26]] I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place \[was\] a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, \[and\] by his fierce anger.

26: 

[[Jer.4.27|27]] For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.

27: 

[[Jer.4.28|28]] For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because I have spoken \[it\], I have purposed \[it\], and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.

28: 

[[Jer.4.29|29]] The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city \[shall be\] forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.

29: 

[[Jer.4.30|30]] And \[when\] thou \[art\] spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; \[thy\] lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life.

30: 

[[Jer.4.31|31]] For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, \[and\] the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, \[that\] bewaileth herself, \[that\] spreadeth her hands, \[saying\], Woe \[is\] me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.

31:
