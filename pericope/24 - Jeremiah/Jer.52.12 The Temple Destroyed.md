[[Jer.52|Jeremiah 52:12 - Jeremiah 52:23]]
*The Temple Destroyed*

[[Jer.52.12|12]] Now in the fifth month, in the tenth \[day\] of the month, which \[was\] the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, \[which\] served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,

12: 

[[Jer.52.13|13]] And burned the house of the LORD, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great \[men\], burned he with fire:

13: 

[[Jer.52.14|14]] And all the army of the Chaldeans, that \[were\] with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.

14: 

[[Jer.52.15|15]] Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive \[certain\] of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.

15: 

[[Jer.52.16|16]] But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left \[certain\] of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.

16: 

[[Jer.52.17|17]] Also the pillars of brass that \[were\] in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that \[was\] in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.

17: 

[[Jer.52.18|18]] The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.

18: 

[[Jer.52.19|19]] And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; \[that\] which \[was\] of gold \[in\] gold, and \[that\] which \[was\] of silver \[in\] silver, took the captain of the guard away.

19: 

[[Jer.52.20|20]] The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that \[were\] under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.

20: 

[[Jer.52.21|21]] And \[concerning\] the pillars, the height of one pillar \[was\] eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof \[was\] four fingers: \[it was\] hollow.

21: 

[[Jer.52.22|22]] And a chapiter of brass \[was\] upon it; and the height of one chapiter \[was\] five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all \[of\] brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates \[were\] like unto these.

22: 

[[Jer.52.23|23]] And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; \[and\] all the pomegranates upon the network \[were\] an hundred round about.

23:
