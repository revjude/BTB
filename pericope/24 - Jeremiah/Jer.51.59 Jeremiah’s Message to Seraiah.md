[[Jer.51|Jeremiah 51:59 - Jeremiah 51:64]]
*Jeremiah’s Message to Seraiah*

[[Jer.51.59|59]] The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And \[this\] Seraiah \[was\] a quiet prince.

59: 

[[Jer.51.60|60]] So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, \[even\] all these words that are written against Babylon.

60: 

[[Jer.51.61|61]] And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words;

61: 

[[Jer.51.62|62]] Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.

62: 

[[Jer.51.63|63]] And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, \[that\] thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates:

63: 

[[Jer.51.64|64]] And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far \[are\] the words of Jeremiah.

64:
