[[Jer.33|Jeremiah 33:14 - Jeremiah 33:26]]
*The Covenant with David*

[[Jer.33.14|14]] Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.

14: 

[[Jer.33.15|15]] In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.

15: 

[[Jer.33.16|16]] In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this \[is the name\] wherewith she shall be called, The LORD our righteousness.

16: 

[[Jer.33.17|17]] For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;

17: 

[[Jer.33.18|18]] Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.

18: 

[[Jer.33.19|19]] And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying,

19: 

[[Jer.33.20|20]] Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;

20: 

[[Jer.33.21|21]] \[Then\] may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.

21: 

[[Jer.33.22|22]] As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.

22: 

[[Jer.33.23|23]] Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,

23: 

[[Jer.33.24|24]] Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.

24: 

[[Jer.33.25|25]] Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant \[be\] not with day and night, \[and if\] I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;

25: 

[[Jer.33.26|26]] Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, \[so\] that I will not take \[any\] of his seed \[to be\] rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.

26:
