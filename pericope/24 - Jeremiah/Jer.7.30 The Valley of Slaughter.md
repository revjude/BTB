[[Jer.7|Jeremiah 7:30 - Jeremiah 7:34]]
*The Valley of Slaughter*

[[Jer.7.30|30]] For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.

30: 

[[Jer.7.31|31]] And they have built the high places of Tophet, which \[is\] in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded \[them\] not, neither came it into my heart.

31: 

[[Jer.7.32|32]] Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place.

32: 

[[Jer.7.33|33]] And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray \[them\] away.

33: 

[[Jer.7.34|34]] Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate.

34:
