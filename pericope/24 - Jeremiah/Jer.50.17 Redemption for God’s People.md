[[Jer.50|Jeremiah 50:17 - Jeremiah 50:20]]
*Redemption for God’s People*

[[Jer.50.17|17]] Israel \[is\] a scattered sheep; the lions have driven \[him\] away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.

17: 

[[Jer.50.18|18]] Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.

18: 

[[Jer.50.19|19]] And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.

19: 

[[Jer.50.20|20]] In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and \[there shall be\] none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.

20:
