[[Jer.6|Jeremiah 6:22 - Jeremiah 6:30]]
*An Invasion from the North*

[[Jer.6.22|22]] Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.

22: 

[[Jer.6.23|23]] They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they \[are\] cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.

23: 

[[Jer.6.24|24]] We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, \[and\] pain, as of a woman in travail.

24: 

[[Jer.6.25|25]] Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy \[and\] fear \[is\] on every side.

25: 

[[Jer.6.26|26]] O daughter of my people, gird \[thee\] with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, \[as for\] an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.

26: 

[[Jer.6.27|27]] I have set thee \[for\] a tower \[and\] a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way.

27: 

[[Jer.6.28|28]] They \[are\] all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: \[they are\] brass and iron; they \[are\] all corrupters.

28: 

[[Jer.6.29|29]] The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.

29: 

[[Jer.6.30|30]] Reprobate silver shall \[men\] call them, because the LORD hath rejected them.

30:
