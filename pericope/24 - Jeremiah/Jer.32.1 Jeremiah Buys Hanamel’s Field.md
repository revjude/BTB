[[Jer.32|Jeremiah 32:1 - Jeremiah 32:15]]
*Jeremiah Buys Hanamel’s Field*

[[Jer.32.1|1]] The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which \[was\] the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.

1: 

[[Jer.32.2|2]] For then the king of Babylon’s army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which \[was\] in the king of Judah’s house.

2: 

[[Jer.32.3|3]] For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;

3: 

[[Jer.32.4|4]] And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;

4: 

[[Jer.32.5|5]] And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?

5: 

[[Jer.32.6|6]] And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

6: 

[[Jer.32.7|7]] Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that \[is\] in Anathoth: for the right of redemption \[is\] thine to buy \[it\].

7: 

[[Jer.32.8|8]] So Hanameel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that \[is\] in Anathoth, which \[is\] in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance \[is\] thine, and the redemption \[is\] thine; buy \[it\] for thyself. Then I knew that this \[was\] the word of the LORD.

8: 

[[Jer.32.9|9]] And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle’s son, that \[was\] in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, \[even\] seventeen shekels of silver.

9: 

[[Jer.32.10|10]] And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed \[it\], and took witnesses, and weighed \[him\] the money in the balances.

10: 

[[Jer.32.11|11]] So I took the evidence of the purchase, \[both\] that which was sealed \[according\] to the law and custom, and that which was open:

11: 

[[Jer.32.12|12]] And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle’s \[son\], and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.

12: 

[[Jer.32.13|13]] And I charged Baruch before them, saying,

13: 

[[Jer.32.14|14]] Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.

14: 

[[Jer.32.15|15]] For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.

15:
