[[Jer.49|Jeremiah 49:28 - Jeremiah 49:33]]
*Judgment on Kedar and Hazor*

[[Jer.49.28|28]] Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.

28: 

[[Jer.49.29|29]] Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear \[is\] on every side.

29: 

[[Jer.49.30|30]] Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.

30: 

[[Jer.49.31|31]] Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, \[which\] dwell alone.

31: 

[[Jer.49.32|32]] And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them \[that are\] in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD.

32: 

[[Jer.49.33|33]] And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, \[and\] a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor \[any\] son of man dwell in it.

33:
