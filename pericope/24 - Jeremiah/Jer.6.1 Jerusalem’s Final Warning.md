[[Jer.6|Jeremiah 6:1 - Jeremiah 6:21]]
*Jerusalem’s Final Warning*

[[Jer.6.1|1]] O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction.

1: 

[[Jer.6.2|2]] I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate \[woman\].

2: 

[[Jer.6.3|3]] The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch \[their\] tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.

3: 

[[Jer.6.4|4]] Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.

4: 

[[Jer.6.5|5]] Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.

5: 

[[Jer.6.6|6]] For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this \[is\] the city to be visited; she \[is\] wholly oppression in the midst of her.

6: 

[[Jer.6.7|7]] As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually \[is\] grief and wounds.

7: 

[[Jer.6.8|8]] Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.

8: 

[[Jer.6.9|9]] Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets.

9: 

[[Jer.6.10|10]] To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear \[is\] uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.

10: 

[[Jer.6.11|11]] Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with \[him that is\] full of days.

11: 

[[Jer.6.12|12]] And their houses shall be turned unto others, \[with their\] fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD.

12: 

[[Jer.6.13|13]] For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one \[is\] given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.

13: 

[[Jer.6.14|14]] They have healed also the hurt \[of the daughter\] of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when \[there is\] no peace.

14: 

[[Jer.6.15|15]] Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time \[that\] I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.

15: 

[[Jer.6.16|16]] Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where \[is\] the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk \[therein\].

16: 

[[Jer.6.17|17]] Also I set watchmen over you, \[saying\], Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.

17: 

[[Jer.6.18|18]] Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what \[is\] among them.

18: 

[[Jer.6.19|19]] Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, \[even\] the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.

19: 

[[Jer.6.20|20]] To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings \[are\] not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.

20: 

[[Jer.6.21|21]] Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.

21:
