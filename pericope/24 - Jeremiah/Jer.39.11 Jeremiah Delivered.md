[[Jer.39|Jeremiah 39:11 - Jeremiah 39:18]]
*Jeremiah Delivered*

[[Jer.39.11|11]] Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,

11: 

[[Jer.39.12|12]] Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.

12: 

[[Jer.39.13|13]] So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon’s princes;

13: 

[[Jer.39.14|14]] Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.

14: 

[[Jer.39.15|15]] Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,

15: 

[[Jer.39.16|16]] Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be \[accomplished\] in that day before thee.

16: 

[[Jer.39.17|17]] But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou \[art\] afraid.

17: 

[[Jer.39.18|18]] For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD.

18:
