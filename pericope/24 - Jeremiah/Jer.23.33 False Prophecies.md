[[Jer.23|Jeremiah 23:33 - Jeremiah 23:40]]
*False Prophecies*

[[Jer.23.33|33]] And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What \[is\] the burden of the LORD? thou shalt then say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the LORD.

33: 

[[Jer.23.34|34]] And \[as for\] the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house.

34: 

[[Jer.23.35|35]] Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the LORD spoken?

35: 

[[Jer.23.36|36]] And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man’s word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.

36: 

[[Jer.23.37|37]] Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered thee? and, What hath the LORD spoken?

37: 

[[Jer.23.38|38]] But since ye say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus saith the LORD; Because ye say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the LORD;

38: 

[[Jer.23.39|39]] Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, \[and cast you\] out of my presence:

39: 

[[Jer.23.40|40]] And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.

40:
