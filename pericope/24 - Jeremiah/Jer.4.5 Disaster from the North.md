[[Jer.4|Jeremiah 4:5 - Jeremiah 4:18]]
*Disaster from the North*

[[Jer.4.5|5]] Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.

5: 

[[Jer.4.6|6]] Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.

6: 

[[Jer.4.7|7]] The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; \[and\] thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.

7: 

[[Jer.4.8|8]] For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.

8: 

[[Jer.4.9|9]] And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, \[that\] the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.

9: 

[[Jer.4.10|10]] Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul.

10: 

[[Jer.4.11|11]] At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,

11: 

[[Jer.4.12|12]] \[Even\] a full wind from those \[places\] shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them.

12: 

[[Jer.4.13|13]] Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots \[shall be\] as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled.

13: 

[[Jer.4.14|14]] O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?

14: 

[[Jer.4.15|15]] For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim.

15: 

[[Jer.4.16|16]] Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, \[that\] watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.

16: 

[[Jer.4.17|17]] As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the LORD.

17: 

[[Jer.4.18|18]] Thy way and thy doings have procured these \[things\] unto thee; this \[is\] thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine heart.

18:
