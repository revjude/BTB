*Captives Carried to Babylon*

[[Jer.52.24|24]] And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:

24: 

[[Jer.52.25|25]] He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king’s person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.

25: 

[[Jer.52.26|26]] So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.

26: 

[[Jer.52.27|27]] And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.

[[Jer.52.28|28]] This \[is\] the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:

28:

29: 

[[Jer.52.30|30]] In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons \[were\] four thousand and six hundred.
