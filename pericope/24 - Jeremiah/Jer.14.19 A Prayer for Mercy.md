[[Jer.14|Jeremiah 14:19 - Jeremiah 14:22]]
*A Prayer for Mercy*

[[Jer.14.19|19]] Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and \[there is\] no healing for us? we looked for peace, and \[there is\] no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!

19: 

[[Jer.14.20|20]] We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, \[and\] the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.

20: 

[[Jer.14.21|21]] Do not abhor \[us\], for thy name’s sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.

21: 

[[Jer.14.22|22]] Are there \[any\] among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? \[art\] not thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these \[things\].

22:
