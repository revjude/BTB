[[Jer.30|Jeremiah 30:1 - Jeremiah 30:24]]
*The Restoration of Israel and Judah*

[[Jer.30.1|1]] The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

1: 

[[Jer.30.2|2]] Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.

2: 

[[Jer.30.3|3]] For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.

3: 

[[Jer.30.4|4]] And these \[are\] the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.

4: 

[[Jer.30.5|5]] For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.

5: 

[[Jer.30.6|6]] Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?

6: 

[[Jer.30.7|7]] Alas! for that day \[is\] great, so that none \[is\] like it: it \[is\] even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.

7: 

[[Jer.30.8|8]] For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, \[that\] I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:

8: 

[[Jer.30.9|9]] But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.

9: 

[[Jer.30.10|10]] Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make \[him\] afraid.

10: 

[[Jer.30.11|11]] For I \[am\] with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.

11: 

[[Jer.30.12|12]] For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise \[is\] incurable, \[and\] thy wound \[is\] grievous.

12: 

[[Jer.30.13|13]] \[There is\] none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.

13: 

[[Jer.30.14|14]] All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; \[because\] thy sins were increased.

14: 

[[Jer.30.15|15]] Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow \[is\] incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: \[because\] thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.

15: 

[[Jer.30.16|16]] Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.

16: 

[[Jer.30.17|17]] For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, \[saying\], This \[is\] Zion, whom no man seeketh after.

17: 

[[Jer.30.18|18]] Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.

18: 

[[Jer.30.19|19]] And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.

19: 

[[Jer.30.20|20]] Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.

20: 

[[Jer.30.21|21]] And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who \[is\] this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.

21: 

[[Jer.30.22|22]] And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.

22: 

[[Jer.30.23|23]] Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.

23: 

[[Jer.30.24|24]] The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done \[it\], and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.

24:
