[[Jer.7|Jeremiah 7:1 - Jeremiah 7:15]]
*Jeremiah’s Message at the Temple Gate*

[[Jer.7.1|1]] The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

1: 

[[Jer.7.2|2]] Stand in the gate of the LORD’S house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all \[ye of\] Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship the LORD.

2: 

[[Jer.7.3|3]] Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.

3: 

[[Jer.7.4|4]] Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, \[are\] these.

4: 

[[Jer.7.5|5]] For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour;

5: 

[[Jer.7.6|6]] \[If\] ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt:

6: 

[[Jer.7.7|7]] Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.

7: 

[[Jer.7.8|8]] Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.

8: 

[[Jer.7.9|9]] Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not;

9: 

[[Jer.7.10|10]] And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?

10: 

[[Jer.7.11|11]] Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen \[it\], saith the LORD.

11: 

[[Jer.7.12|12]] But go ye now unto my place which \[was\] in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.

12: 

[[Jer.7.13|13]] And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not;

13: 

[[Jer.7.14|14]] Therefore will I do unto \[this\] house, which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.

14: 

[[Jer.7.15|15]] And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, \[even\] the whole seed of Ephraim.

15:
