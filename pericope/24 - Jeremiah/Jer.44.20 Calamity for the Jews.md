[[Jer.44|Jeremiah 44:20 - Jeremiah 44:30]]
*Calamity for the Jews*

[[Jer.44.20|20]] Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him \[that\] answer, saying,

20: 

[[Jer.44.21|21]] The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it \[not\] into his mind?

21: 

[[Jer.44.22|22]] So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, \[and\] because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.

22: 

[[Jer.44.23|23]] Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.

23: 

[[Jer.44.24|24]] Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that \[are\] in the land of Egypt:

24: 

[[Jer.44.25|25]] Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.

25: 

[[Jer.44.26|26]] Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth.

26: 

[[Jer.44.27|27]] Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that \[are\] in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.

27: 

[[Jer.44.28|28]] Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.

28: 

[[Jer.44.29|29]] And this \[shall be\] a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:

29: 

[[Jer.44.30|30]] Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaohhophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.

30:
