[[Jer.21|Jeremiah 21:11 - Jeremiah 21:14]]
*A Message to the House of David*

[[Jer.21.11|11]] And touching the house of the king of Judah, \[say\], Hear ye the word of the LORD;

11: 

[[Jer.21.12|12]] O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver \[him that is\] spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench \[it\], because of the evil of your doings.

12: 

[[Jer.21.13|13]] Behold, I \[am\] against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, \[and\] rock of the plain, saith the LORD; which say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?

13: 

[[Jer.21.14|14]] But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the LORD: and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof, and it shall devour all things round about it.

14:
