[[Jer.36|Jeremiah 36:20 - Jeremiah 36:26]]
*Jehoiakim Burns the Scroll*

[[Jer.36.20|20]] And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.

20: 

[[Jer.36.21|21]] So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe’s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.

21: 

[[Jer.36.22|22]] Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and \[there was a fire\] on the hearth burning before him.

22: 

[[Jer.36.23|23]] And it came to pass, \[that\] when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast \[it\] into the fire that \[was\] on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that \[was\] on the hearth.

23: 

[[Jer.36.24|24]] Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, \[neither\] the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.

24: 

[[Jer.36.25|25]] Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.

25: 

[[Jer.36.26|26]] But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.

26:
