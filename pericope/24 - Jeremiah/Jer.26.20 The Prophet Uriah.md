[[Jer.26|Jeremiah 26:20 - Jeremiah 26:24]]
*The Prophet Uriah*

[[Jer.26.20|20]] And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:

20: 

[[Jer.26.21|21]] And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;

21: 

[[Jer.26.22|22]] And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, \[namely\], Elnathan the son of Achbor, and \[certain\] men with him into Egypt.

22: 

[[Jer.26.23|23]] And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.

23: 

[[Jer.26.24|24]] Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.

24:
