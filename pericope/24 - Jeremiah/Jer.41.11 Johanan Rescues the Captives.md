[[Jer.41|Jeremiah 41:11 - Jeremiah 41:18]]
*Johanan Rescues the Captives*

[[Jer.41.11|11]] But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that \[were\] with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,

11: 

[[Jer.41.12|12]] Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that \[are\] in Gibeon.

12: 

[[Jer.41.13|13]] Now it came to pass, \[that\] when all the people which \[were\] with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that \[were\] with him, then they were glad.

13: 

[[Jer.41.14|14]] So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.

14: 

[[Jer.41.15|15]] But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.

15: 

[[Jer.41.16|16]] Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that \[were\] with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after \[that\] he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, \[even\] mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:

16: 

[[Jer.41.17|17]] And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,

17: 

[[Jer.41.18|18]] Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.

18:
