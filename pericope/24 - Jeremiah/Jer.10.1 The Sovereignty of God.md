[[Jer.10|Jeremiah 10:1 - Jeremiah 10:16]]
*The Sovereignty of God*

[[Jer.10.1|1]] Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:

1: 

[[Jer.10.2|2]] Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.

2: 

[[Jer.10.3|3]] For the customs of the people \[are\] vain: for \[one\] cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.

3: 

[[Jer.10.4|4]] They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.

4: 

[[Jer.10.5|5]] They \[are\] upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also \[is it\] in them to do good.

5: 

[[Jer.10.6|6]] Forasmuch as \[there is\] none like unto thee, O LORD; thou \[art\] great, and thy name \[is\] great in might.

6: 

[[Jer.10.7|7]] Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise \[men\] of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, \[there is\] none like unto thee.

7: 

[[Jer.10.8|8]] But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock \[is\] a doctrine of vanities.

8: 

[[Jer.10.9|9]] Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple \[is\] their clothing: they \[are\] all the work of cunning \[men\].

9: 

[[Jer.10.10|10]] But the LORD \[is\] the true God, he \[is\] the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.

10: 

[[Jer.10.11|11]] Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, \[even\] they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.

11: 

[[Jer.10.12|12]] He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.

12: 

[[Jer.10.13|13]] When he uttereth his voice, \[there is\] a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.

13: 

[[Jer.10.14|14]] Every man is brutish in \[his\] knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image \[is\] falsehood, and \[there is\] no breath in them.

14: 

[[Jer.10.15|15]] They \[are\] vanity, \[and\] the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.

15: 

[[Jer.10.16|16]] The portion of Jacob \[is\] not like them: for he \[is\] the former of all \[things\]; and Israel \[is\] the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts \[is\] his name.

16:
