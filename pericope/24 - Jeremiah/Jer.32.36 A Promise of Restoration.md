[[Jer.32|Jeremiah 32:36 - Jeremiah 32:44]]
*A Promise of Restoration*

[[Jer.32.36|36]] And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;

36: 

[[Jer.32.37|37]] Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:

37: 

[[Jer.32.38|38]] And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:

38: 

[[Jer.32.39|39]] And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:

39: 

[[Jer.32.40|40]] And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.

40: 

[[Jer.32.41|41]] Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.

41: 

[[Jer.32.42|42]] For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.

42: 

[[Jer.32.43|43]] And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, \[It is\] desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.

43: 

[[Jer.32.44|44]] Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal \[them\], and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the LORD.

44:
