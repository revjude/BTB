[[Jer.23|Jeremiah 23:1 - Jeremiah 23:8]]
*David’s Righteous Branch*

[[Jer.23.1|1]] Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the LORD.

1: 

[[Jer.23.2|2]] Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the LORD.

2: 

[[Jer.23.3|3]] And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.

3: 

[[Jer.23.4|4]] And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the LORD.

4: 

[[Jer.23.5|5]] Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.

5: 

[[Jer.23.6|6]] In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this \[is\] his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.

6: 

[[Jer.23.7|7]] Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD liveth, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;

7: 

[[Jer.23.8|8]] But, The LORD liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land.

8:
