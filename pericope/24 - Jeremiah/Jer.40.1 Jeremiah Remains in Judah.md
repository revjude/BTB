[[Jer.40|Jeremiah 40:1 - Jeremiah 40:6]]
*Jeremiah Remains in Judah*

[[Jer.40.1|1]] The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive unto Babylon.

1: 

[[Jer.40.2|2]] And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.

2: 

[[Jer.40.3|3]] Now the LORD hath brought \[it\], and done according as he hath said: because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.

3: 

[[Jer.40.4|4]] And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which \[were\] upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land \[is\] before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go.

4: 

[[Jer.40.5|5]] Now while he was not yet gone back, \[he said\], Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go.

5: 

[[Jer.40.6|6]] Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.

6:
