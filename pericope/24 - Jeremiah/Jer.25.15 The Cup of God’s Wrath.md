[[Jer.25|Jeremiah 25:15 - Jeremiah 25:33]]
*The Cup of God’s Wrath*

[[Jer.25.15|15]] For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.

15: 

[[Jer.25.16|16]] And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.

16: 

[[Jer.25.17|17]] Then took I the cup at the LORD’S hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me:

17: 

[[Jer.25.18|18]] \[To wit\], Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as \[it is\] this day;

18: 

[[Jer.25.19|19]] Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;

19: 

[[Jer.25.20|20]] And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,

20: 

[[Jer.25.21|21]] Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon,

21: 

[[Jer.25.22|22]] And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which \[are\] beyond the sea,

22: 

[[Jer.25.23|23]] Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all \[that are\] in the utmost corners,

23: 

[[Jer.25.24|24]] And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert,

24: 

[[Jer.25.25|25]] And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes,

25: 

[[Jer.25.26|26]] And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which \[are\] upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.

26: 

[[Jer.25.27|27]] Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.

27: 

[[Jer.25.28|28]] And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink.

28: 

[[Jer.25.29|29]] For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts.

29: 

[[Jer.25.30|30]] Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread \[the grapes\], against all the inhabitants of the earth.

30: 

[[Jer.25.31|31]] A noise shall come \[even\] to the ends of the earth; for the LORD hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them \[that are\] wicked to the sword, saith the LORD.

31: 

[[Jer.25.32|32]] Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.

32: 

[[Jer.25.33|33]] And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from \[one\] end of the earth even unto the \[other\] end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.

33:
