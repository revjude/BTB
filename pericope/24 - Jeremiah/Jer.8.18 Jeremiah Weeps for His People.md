[[Jer.8|Jeremiah 8:18 - Jeremiah 8:22]]
*Jeremiah Weeps for His People*

[[Jer.8.18|18]] \[When\] I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart \[is\] faint in me.

18: 

[[Jer.8.19|19]] Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country: \[Is\] not the LORD in Zion? \[is\] not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, \[and\] with strange vanities?

19: 

[[Jer.8.20|20]] The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.

20: 

[[Jer.8.21|21]] For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me.

21: 

[[Jer.8.22|22]] \[Is there\] no balm in Gilead; \[is there\] no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?

22:
