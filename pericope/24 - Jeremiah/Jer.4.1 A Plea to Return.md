[[Jer.4|Jeremiah 4:1 - Jeremiah 4:4]]
*A Plea to Return*

[[Jer.4.1|1]] If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return unto me: and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove.

1: 

[[Jer.4.2|2]] And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.

2: 

[[Jer.4.3|3]] For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.

3: 

[[Jer.4.4|4]] Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench \[it\], because of the evil of your doings.

4:
