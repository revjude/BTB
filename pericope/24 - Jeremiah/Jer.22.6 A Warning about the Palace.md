[[Jer.22|Jeremiah 22:6 - Jeremiah 22:9]]
*A Warning about the Palace*

[[Jer.22.6|6]] For thus saith the LORD unto the king’s house of Judah; Thou \[art\] Gilead unto me, \[and\] the head of Lebanon: \[yet\] surely I will make thee a wilderness, \[and\] cities \[which\] are not inhabited.

6: 

[[Jer.22.7|7]] And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast \[them\] into the fire.

7: 

[[Jer.22.8|8]] And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this great city?

8: 

[[Jer.22.9|9]] Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.

9:
