[[Jer.25|Jeremiah 25:34 - Jeremiah 25:38]]
*The Cry of the Shepherds*

[[Jer.25.34|34]] Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves \[in the ashes\], ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel.

34: 

[[Jer.25.35|35]] And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.

35: 

[[Jer.25.36|36]] A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, \[shall be heard\]: for the LORD hath spoiled their pasture.

36: 

[[Jer.25.37|37]] And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the LORD.

37: 

[[Jer.25.38|38]] He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.

38:
