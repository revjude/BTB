[[Jer.47|Jeremiah 47:1 - Jeremiah 47:7]]
*Judgment on the Philistines*

[[Jer.47.1|1]] The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza.

1: 

[[Jer.47.2|2]] Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that is therein; the city, and them that dwell therein: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl.

2: 

[[Jer.47.3|3]] At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong \[horses\], at the rushing of his chariots, \[and at\] the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to \[their\] children for feebleness of hands;

3: 

[[Jer.47.4|4]] Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, \[and\] to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor.

4: 

[[Jer.47.5|5]] Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off \[with\] the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?

5: 

[[Jer.47.6|6]] O thou sword of the LORD, how long \[will it be\] ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still.

6: 

[[Jer.47.7|7]] How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he appointed it.

7:
