[[Jer.20|Jeremiah 20:1 - Jeremiah 20:6]]
*Pashhur Persecutes Jeremiah*

[[Jer.20.1|1]] Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who \[was\] also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.

1: 

[[Jer.20.2|2]] Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that \[were\] in the high gate of Benjamin, which \[was\] by the house of the LORD.

2: 

[[Jer.20.3|3]] And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The LORD hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magormissabib.

3: 

[[Jer.20.4|4]] For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold \[it\]: and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.

4: 

[[Jer.20.5|5]] Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.

5: 

[[Jer.20.6|6]] And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies.

6:
