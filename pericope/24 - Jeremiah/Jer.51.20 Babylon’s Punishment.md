[[Jer.51|Jeremiah 51:20 - Jeremiah 51:58]]
*Babylon’s Punishment*

[[Jer.51.20|20]] Thou \[art\] my battle axe \[and\] weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;

20: 

[[Jer.51.21|21]] And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider;

21: 

[[Jer.51.22|22]] With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid;

22: 

[[Jer.51.23|23]] I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.

23: 

[[Jer.51.24|24]] And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the LORD.

24: 

[[Jer.51.25|25]] Behold, I \[am\] against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.

25: 

[[Jer.51.26|26]] And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the LORD.

26: 

[[Jer.51.27|27]] Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers.

27: 

[[Jer.51.28|28]] Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion.

28: 

[[Jer.51.29|29]] And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.

29: 

[[Jer.51.30|30]] The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained in \[their\] holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken.

30: 

[[Jer.51.31|31]] One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at \[one\] end,

31: 

[[Jer.51.32|32]] And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.

32: 

[[Jer.51.33|33]] For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon \[is\] like a threshingfloor, \[it is\] time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.

33: 

[[Jer.51.34|34]] Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out.

34: 

[[Jer.51.35|35]] The violence done to me and to my flesh \[be\] upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.

35: 

[[Jer.51.36|36]] Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.

36: 

[[Jer.51.37|37]] And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.

37: 

[[Jer.51.38|38]] They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions’ whelps.

38: 

[[Jer.51.39|39]] In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the LORD.

39: 

[[Jer.51.40|40]] I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats.

40: 

[[Jer.51.41|41]] How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!

41: 

[[Jer.51.42|42]] The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.

42: 

[[Jer.51.43|43]] Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth \[any\] son of man pass thereby.

43: 

[[Jer.51.44|44]] And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.

44: 

[[Jer.51.45|45]] My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.

45: 

[[Jer.51.46|46]] And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come \[one\] year, and after that in \[another\] year \[shall come\] a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.

46: 

[[Jer.51.47|47]] Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.

47: 

[[Jer.51.48|48]] Then the heaven and the earth, and all that \[is\] therein, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the LORD.

48: 

[[Jer.51.49|49]] As Babylon \[hath caused\] the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.

49: 

[[Jer.51.50|50]] Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.

50: 

[[Jer.51.51|51]] We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD’S house.

51: 

[[Jer.51.52|52]] Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.

52: 

[[Jer.51.53|53]] Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, \[yet\] from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith the LORD.

53: 

[[Jer.51.54|54]] A sound of a cry \[cometh\] from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:

54: 

[[Jer.51.55|55]] Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered:

55: 

[[Jer.51.56|56]] Because the spoiler is come upon her, \[even\] upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite.

56: 

[[Jer.51.57|57]] And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise \[men\], her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name \[is\] the LORD of hosts.

57: 

[[Jer.51.58|58]] Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.

58:
