[[Jer.29|Jeremiah 29:24 - Jeremiah 29:32]]
*The Message to Shemaiah*

[[Jer.29.24|24]] \[Thus\] shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,

24: 

[[Jer.29.25|25]] Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that \[are\] at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,

25: 

[[Jer.29.26|26]] The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man \[that is\] mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.

26: 

[[Jer.29.27|27]] Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you?

27: 

[[Jer.29.28|28]] For therefore he sent unto us \[in\] Babylon, saying, This \[captivity is\] long: build ye houses, and dwell \[in them\]; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.

28: 

[[Jer.29.29|29]] And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.

29: 

[[Jer.29.30|30]] Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,

30: 

[[Jer.29.31|31]] Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie:

31: 

[[Jer.29.32|32]] Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD.

32:
