[[Jer.17|Jeremiah 17:12 - Jeremiah 17:18]]
*Jeremiah’s Prayer for Deliverance*

[[Jer.17.12|12]] A glorious high throne from the beginning \[is\] the place of our sanctuary.

12: 

[[Jer.17.13|13]] O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, \[and\] they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.

13: 

[[Jer.17.14|14]] Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for thou \[art\] my praise.

14: 

[[Jer.17.15|15]] Behold, they say unto me, Where \[is\] the word of the LORD? let it come now.

15: 

[[Jer.17.16|16]] As for me, I have not hastened from \[being\] a pastor to follow thee: neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which came out of my lips was \[right\] before thee.

16: 

[[Jer.17.17|17]] Be not a terror unto me: thou \[art\] my hope in the day of evil.

17: 

[[Jer.17.18|18]] Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.

18:
