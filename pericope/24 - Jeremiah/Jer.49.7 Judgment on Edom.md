[[Jer.49|Jeremiah 49:7 - Jeremiah 49:22]]
*Judgment on Edom*

[[Jer.49.7|7]] Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; \[Is\] wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?

7: 

[[Jer.49.8|8]] Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time \[that\] I will visit him.

8: 

[[Jer.49.9|9]] If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave \[some\] gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.

9: 

[[Jer.49.10|10]] But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he \[is\] not.

10: 

[[Jer.49.11|11]] Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve \[them\] alive; and let thy widows trust in me.

11: 

[[Jer.49.12|12]] For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment \[was\] not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and \[art\] thou he \[that\] shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink \[of it\].

12: 

[[Jer.49.13|13]] For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.

13: 

[[Jer.49.14|14]] I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen, \[saying\], Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.

14: 

[[Jer.49.15|15]] For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, \[and\] despised among men.

15: 

[[Jer.49.16|16]] Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, \[and\] the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.

16: 

[[Jer.49.17|17]] Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.

17: 

[[Jer.49.18|18]] As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour \[cities\] thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.

18: 

[[Jer.49.19|19]] Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who \[is\] a chosen \[man, that\] I may appoint over her? for who \[is\] like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who \[is\] that shepherd that will stand before me?

19: 

[[Jer.49.20|20]] Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.

20: 

[[Jer.49.21|21]] The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.

21: 

[[Jer.49.22|22]] Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.

22:
