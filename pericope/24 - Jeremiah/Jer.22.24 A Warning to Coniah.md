[[Jer.22|Jeremiah 22:24 - Jeremiah 22:30]]
*A Warning to Coniah*

[[Jer.22.24|24]] \[As\] I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence;

24: 

[[Jer.22.25|25]] And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand \[of them\] whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.

25: 

[[Jer.22.26|26]] And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.

26: 

[[Jer.22.27|27]] But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall they not return.

27: 

[[Jer.22.28|28]] \[Is\] this man Coniah a despised broken idol? \[is he\] a vessel wherein \[is\] no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?

28: 

[[Jer.22.29|29]] O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.

29: 

[[Jer.22.30|30]] Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man \[that\] shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.

30:
