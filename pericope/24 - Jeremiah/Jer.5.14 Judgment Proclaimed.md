[[Jer.5|Jeremiah 5:14 - Jeremiah 5:31]]
*Judgment Proclaimed*

[[Jer.5.14|14]] Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.

14: 

[[Jer.5.15|15]] Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the LORD: it \[is\] a mighty nation, it \[is\] an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.

15: 

[[Jer.5.16|16]] Their quiver \[is\] as an open sepulchre, they \[are\] all mighty men.

16: 

[[Jer.5.17|17]] And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, \[which\] thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.

17: 

[[Jer.5.18|18]] Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with you.

18: 

[[Jer.5.19|19]] And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the LORD our God all these \[things\] unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land \[that is\] not yours.

19: 

[[Jer.5.20|20]] Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,

20: 

[[Jer.5.21|21]] Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:

21: 

[[Jer.5.22|22]] Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand \[for\] the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?

22: 

[[Jer.5.23|23]] But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.

23: 

[[Jer.5.24|24]] Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.

24: 

[[Jer.5.25|25]] Your iniquities have turned away these \[things\], and your sins have withholden good \[things\] from you.

25: 

[[Jer.5.26|26]] For among my people are found wicked \[men\]: they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.

26: 

[[Jer.5.27|27]] As a cage is full of birds, so \[are\] their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.

27: 

[[Jer.5.28|28]] They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.

28: 

[[Jer.5.29|29]] Shall I not visit for these \[things\]? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?

29: 

[[Jer.5.30|30]] A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;

30: 

[[Jer.5.31|31]] The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love \[to have it\] so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?

31:
