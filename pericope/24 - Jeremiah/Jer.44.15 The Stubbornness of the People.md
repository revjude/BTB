[[Jer.44|Jeremiah 44:15 - Jeremiah 44:19]]
*The Stubbornness of the People*

[[Jer.44.15|15]] Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,

15: 

[[Jer.44.16|16]] \[As for\] the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee.

16: 

[[Jer.44.17|17]] But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for \[then\] had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.

17: 

[[Jer.44.18|18]] But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all \[things\], and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.

18: 

[[Jer.44.19|19]] And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?

19:
