[[Jer.39|Jeremiah 39:1 - Jeremiah 39:10]]
*The Fall of Jerusalem*

[[Jer.39.1|1]] In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.

1: 

[[Jer.39.2|2]] \[And\] in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth \[day\] of the month, the city was broken up.

2: 

[[Jer.39.3|3]] And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, \[even\] Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.

3: 

[[Jer.39.4|4]] And it came to pass, \[that\] when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.

4: 

[[Jer.39.5|5]] But the Chaldeans’ army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.

5: 

[[Jer.39.6|6]] Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.

6: 

[[Jer.39.7|7]] Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.

7: 

[[Jer.39.8|8]] And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.

8: 

[[Jer.39.9|9]] Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.

9: 

[[Jer.39.10|10]] But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.

10:
