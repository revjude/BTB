[[Jer.36|Jeremiah 36:11 - Jeremiah 36:19]]
*Jeremiah’s Scroll Read in the Palace*

[[Jer.36.11|11]] When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,

11: 

[[Jer.36.12|12]] Then he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, \[even\] Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.

12: 

[[Jer.36.13|13]] Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.

13: 

[[Jer.36.14|14]] Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.

14: 

[[Jer.36.15|15]] And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read \[it\] in their ears.

15: 

[[Jer.36.16|16]] Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.

16: 

[[Jer.36.17|17]] And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?

17: 

[[Jer.36.18|18]] Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote \[them\] with ink in the book.

18: 

[[Jer.36.19|19]] Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.

19:
