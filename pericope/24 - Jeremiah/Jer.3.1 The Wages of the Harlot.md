[[Jer.3|Jeremiah 3:1 - Jeremiah 3:5]]
*The Wages of the Harlot*

[[Jer.3.1|1]] They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man’s, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the LORD.

1: 

[[Jer.3.2|2]] Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.

2: 

[[Jer.3.3|3]] Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; and thou hadst a whore’s forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.

3: 

[[Jer.3.4|4]] Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou \[art\] the guide of my youth?

4: 

[[Jer.3.5|5]] Will he reserve \[his anger\] for ever? will he keep \[it\] to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest.

5:
