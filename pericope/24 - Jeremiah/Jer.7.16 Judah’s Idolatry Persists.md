[[Jer.7|Jeremiah 7:16 - Jeremiah 7:29]]
*Judah’s Idolatry Persists*

[[Jer.7.16|16]] Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.

16: 

[[Jer.7.17|17]] Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?

17: 

[[Jer.7.18|18]] The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead \[their\] dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.

18: 

[[Jer.7.19|19]] Do they provoke me to anger? saith the LORD: \[do they\] not \[provoke\] themselves to the confusion of their own faces?

19: 

[[Jer.7.20|20]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.

20: 

[[Jer.7.21|21]] Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh.

21: 

[[Jer.7.22|22]] For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:

22: 

[[Jer.7.23|23]] But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.

23: 

[[Jer.7.24|24]] But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels \[and\] in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.

24: 

[[Jer.7.25|25]] Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending \[them\]:

25: 

[[Jer.7.26|26]] Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.

26: 

[[Jer.7.27|27]] Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.

27: 

[[Jer.7.28|28]] But thou shalt say unto them, This \[is\] a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth correction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.

28: 

[[Jer.7.29|29]] Cut off thine hair, \[O Jerusalem\], and cast \[it\] away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.

29:
