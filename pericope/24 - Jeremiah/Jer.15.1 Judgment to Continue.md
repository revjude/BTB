[[Jer.15|Jeremiah 15:1 - Jeremiah 15:9]]
*Judgment to Continue*

[[Jer.15.1|1]] Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, \[yet\] my mind \[could\] not \[be\] toward this people: cast \[them\] out of my sight, and let them go forth.

1: 

[[Jer.15.2|2]] And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as \[are\] for death, to death; and such as \[are\] for the sword, to the sword; and such as \[are\] for the famine, to the famine; and such as \[are\] for the captivity, to the captivity.

2: 

[[Jer.15.3|3]] And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.

3: 

[[Jer.15.4|4]] And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for \[that\] which he did in Jerusalem.

4: 

[[Jer.15.5|5]] For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest?

5: 

[[Jer.15.6|6]] Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.

6: 

[[Jer.15.7|7]] And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave \[them\] of children, I will destroy my people, \[since\] they return not from their ways.

7: 

[[Jer.15.8|8]] Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused \[him\] to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.

8: 

[[Jer.15.9|9]] She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while \[it was\] yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD.

9:
