[[Jer.11|Jeremiah 11:18 - Jeremiah 11:23]]
*A Plot against Jeremiah*

[[Jer.11.18|18]] And the LORD hath given me knowledge \[of it\], and I know \[it\]: then thou shewedst me their doings.

18: 

[[Jer.11.19|19]] But I \[was\] like a lamb \[or\] an ox \[that\] is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, \[saying\], Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.

19: 

[[Jer.11.20|20]] But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause.

20: 

[[Jer.11.21|21]] Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that thou die not by our hand:

21: 

[[Jer.11.22|22]] Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine:

22: 

[[Jer.11.23|23]] And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, \[even\] the year of their visitation.

23:
