[[Acts.21|Acts 21:1 - Acts 21:7]]
*Paul’s Journey to Jerusalem*

[[Acts.21.1|1]] And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the \[day\] following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:

1: 

[[Acts.21.2|2]] And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.

2: 

[[Acts.21.3|3]] Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.

3: 

[[Acts.21.4|4]] And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.

4: 

[[Acts.21.5|5]] And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till \[we were\] out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.

5: 

[[Acts.21.6|6]] And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.

6: 

[[Acts.21.7|7]] And when we had finished \[our\] course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.

7:
