[[Acts.4|Acts 4:13 - Acts 4:22]]
*The Name Forbidden*

[[Acts.4.13|13]] Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.

13: 

[[Acts.4.14|14]] And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.

14: 

[[Acts.4.15|15]] But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,

15: 

[[Acts.4.16|16]] Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them \[is\] manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny \[it\].

16: 

[[Acts.4.17|17]] But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.

17: 

[[Acts.4.18|18]] And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.

18: 

[[Acts.4.19|19]] But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.

19: 

[[Acts.4.20|20]] For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.

20: 

[[Acts.4.21|21]] So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all \[men\] glorified God for that which was done.

21: 

[[Acts.4.22|22]] For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.

22:
