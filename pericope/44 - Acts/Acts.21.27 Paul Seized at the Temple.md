[[Acts.21|Acts 21:27 - Acts 21:36]]
*Paul Seized at the Temple*

[[Acts.21.27|27]] And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,

27: 

[[Acts.21.28|28]] Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all \[men\] every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.

28: 

[[Acts.21.29|29]] (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)

29: 

[[Acts.21.30|30]] And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.

30: 

[[Acts.21.31|31]] And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.

31: 

[[Acts.21.32|32]] Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul.

32: 

[[Acts.21.33|33]] Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded \[him\] to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.

33: 

[[Acts.21.34|34]] And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.

34: 

[[Acts.21.35|35]] And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.

35: 

[[Acts.21.36|36]] For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.

36:
