[[Acts.4|Acts 4:23 - Acts 4:31]]
*The Believers’ Prayer*

[[Acts.4.23|23]] And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.

23: 

[[Acts.4.24|24]] And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou \[art\] God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:

24: 

[[Acts.4.25|25]] Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?

25: 

[[Acts.4.26|26]] The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.

29: 

[[Acts.4.30|30]] By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.

30: 

[[Acts.4.31|31]] And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.

31:
