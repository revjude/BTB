[[Acts.5|Acts 5:12 - Acts 5:16]]
*The Apostles Heal Many*

[[Acts.5.12|12]] And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.

12: 

[[Acts.5.13|13]] And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.

13: 

[[Acts.5.14|14]] And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)

14: 

[[Acts.5.15|15]] Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid \[them\] on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.

15: 

[[Acts.5.16|16]] There came also a multitude \[out\] of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.

16:
