[[Acts.19|Acts 19:13 - Acts 19:20]]
*Seven Sons of Sceva*

[[Acts.19.13|13]] Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.

13: 

[[Acts.19.14|14]] And there were seven sons of \[one\] Sceva, a Jew, \[and\] chief of the priests, which did so.

14: 

[[Acts.19.15|15]] And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?

15: 

[[Acts.19.16|16]] And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.

16: 

[[Acts.19.17|17]] And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.

17: 

[[Acts.19.18|18]] And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.

18: 

[[Acts.19.19|19]] Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all \[men\]: and they counted the price of them, and found \[it\] fifty thousand \[pieces\] of silver.

19: 

[[Acts.19.20|20]] So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.

20:
