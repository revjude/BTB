[[Acts.5|Acts 5:33 - Acts 5:42]]
*Gamaliel’s Advice*

[[Acts.5.33|33]] When they heard \[that\], they were cut \[to the heart\], and took counsel to slay them.

33: 

[[Acts.5.34|34]] Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;

34: 

[[Acts.5.35|35]] And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.

35: 

[[Acts.5.36|36]] For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.

36: 

[[Acts.5.37|37]] After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, \[even\] as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.

37: 

[[Acts.5.38|38]] And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:

38: 

[[Acts.5.39|39]] But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.

39: 

[[Acts.5.40|40]] And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten \[them\], they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.

40: 

[[Acts.5.41|41]] And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.

41: 

[[Acts.5.42|42]] And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.

42:
