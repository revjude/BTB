[[Acts.1|Acts 1:12 - Acts 1:26]]
*Matthias Replaces Judas*

[[Acts.1.12|12]] Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day’s journey.

12: 

[[Acts.1.13|13]] And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James \[the son\] of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas \[the brother\] of James.

13: 

[[Acts.1.14|14]] These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.

14: 

[[Acts.1.15|15]] And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)

15: 

[[Acts.1.16|16]] Men \[and\] brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.

16: 

[[Acts.1.17|17]] For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.

17: 

[[Acts.1.18|18]] Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.

18: 

[[Acts.1.19|19]] And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.

19: 

[[Acts.1.20|20]] For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.

20: 

[[Acts.1.21|21]] Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,

21: 

[[Acts.1.22|22]] Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.

22: 

[[Acts.1.23|23]] And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.

23: 

[[Acts.1.24|24]] And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all \[men\], shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,

24: 

[[Acts.1.25|25]] That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.

25: 

[[Acts.1.26|26]] And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
