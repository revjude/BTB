[[Acts.22|Acts 22:22 - Acts 22:30]]
*Paul the Roman Citizen*

[[Acts.22.22|22]] And they gave him audience unto this word, and \[then\] lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a \[fellow\] from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.

22: 

[[Acts.22.23|23]] And as they cried out, and cast off \[their\] clothes, and threw dust into the air,

23: 

[[Acts.22.24|24]] The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.

24: 

[[Acts.22.25|25]] And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?

25: 

[[Acts.22.26|26]] When the centurion heard \[that\], he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.

26: 

[[Acts.22.27|27]] Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.

27: 

[[Acts.22.28|28]] And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was \[free\] born.

28: 

[[Acts.22.29|29]] Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.

29: 

[[Acts.22.30|30]] On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from \[his\] bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.

30:
