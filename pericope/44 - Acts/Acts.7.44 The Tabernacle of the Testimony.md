[[Acts.7|Acts 7:44 - Acts 7:53]]
*The Tabernacle of the Testimony*

[[Acts.7.44|44]] Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.

44: 

[[Acts.7.45|45]] Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;

45: 

[[Acts.7.46|46]] Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.

46: 

[[Acts.7.47|47]] But Solomon built him an house.

47: 

[[Acts.7.48|48]] Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,

48: 

[[Acts.7.49|49]] Heaven \[is\] my throne, and earth \[is\] my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what \[is\] the place of my rest?

49: 

[[Acts.7.50|50]] Hath not my hand made all these things?

50: 

[[Acts.7.51|51]] Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers \[did\], so \[do\] ye.

51: 

[[Acts.7.52|52]] Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:

52: 

[[Acts.7.53|53]] Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept \[it\].

53:
