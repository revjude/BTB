*Eutychus Revived at Troas*

[[Acts.20.7|7]] And upon the first \[day\] of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.

7: 

[[Acts.20.8|8]] And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.

8: 

[[Acts.20.9|9]] And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.

9: 

[[Acts.20.10|10]] And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing \[him\] said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.

10: 

[[Acts.20.11|11]] When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.

11: 

[[Acts.20.12|12]] And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.

12:
