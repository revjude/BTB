[[Acts.3|Acts 3:1 - Acts 3:10]]
*A Lame Man Walks*

[[Acts.3.1|1]] Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, \[being\] the ninth \[hour\].

1: 

[[Acts.3.2|2]] And a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;

2: 

[[Acts.3.3|3]] Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.

3: 

[[Acts.3.4|4]] And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.

4: 

[[Acts.3.5|5]] And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.

5: 

[[Acts.3.6|6]] Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.

6: 

[[Acts.3.7|7]] And he took him by the right hand, and lifted \[him\] up: and immediately his feet and ancle bones received strength.

7: 

[[Acts.3.8|8]] And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.

8: 

[[Acts.3.9|9]] And all the people saw him walking and praising God:

9: 

[[Acts.3.10|10]] And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.

10:
