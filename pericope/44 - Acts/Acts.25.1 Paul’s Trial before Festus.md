[[Acts.25|Acts 25:1 - Acts 25:9]]
*Paul’s Trial before Festus*

[[Acts.25.1|1]] Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.

1: 

[[Acts.25.2|2]] Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,

2: 

[[Acts.25.3|3]] And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.

3: 

[[Acts.25.4|4]] But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly \[thither\].

4: 

[[Acts.25.5|5]] Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with \[me\], and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.

5: 

[[Acts.25.6|6]] And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.

6: 

[[Acts.25.7|7]] And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.

7: 

[[Acts.25.8|8]] While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.

8: 

[[Acts.25.9|9]] But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?

9:
