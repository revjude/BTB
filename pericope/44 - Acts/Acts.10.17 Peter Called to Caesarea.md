[[Acts.10|Acts 10:17 - Acts 10:23]]
*Peter Called to Caesarea*

[[Acts.10.17|17]] Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate,

17: 

[[Acts.10.18|18]] And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.

18: 

[[Acts.10.19|19]] While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.

19: 

[[Acts.10.20|20]] Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.

20: 

[[Acts.10.21|21]] Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what \[is\] the cause wherefore ye are come?

21: 

[[Acts.10.22|22]] And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.

22: 

[[Acts.10.23|23]] Then called he them in, and lodged \[them\]. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.

23:
