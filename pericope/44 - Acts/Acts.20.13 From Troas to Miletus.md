[[Acts.20|Acts 20:13 - Acts 20:16]]
*From Troas to Miletus*

[[Acts.20.13|13]] And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.

13: 

[[Acts.20.14|14]] And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.

14: 

[[Acts.20.15|15]] And we sailed thence, and came the next \[day\] over against Chios; and the next \[day\] we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next \[day\] we came to Miletus.

15: 

[[Acts.20.16|16]] For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.

16:
