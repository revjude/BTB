[[Acts.24|Acts 24:1 - Acts 24:9]]
*Tertullus Prosecutes Paul*

[[Acts.24.1|1]] And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and \[with\] a certain orator \[named\] Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.

1: 

[[Acts.24.2|2]] And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse \[him\], saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,

2: 

[[Acts.24.3|3]] We accept \[it\] always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.

3: 

[[Acts.24.4|4]] Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.

4: 

[[Acts.24.5|5]] For we have found this man \[a\] pestilent \[fellow\], and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:

5: 

[[Acts.24.6|6]] Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.

6: 

[[Acts.24.8|8]] Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.

8: 

[[Acts.24.9|9]] And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.

9:
