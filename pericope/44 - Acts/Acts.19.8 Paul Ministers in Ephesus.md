[[Acts.19|Acts 19:8 - Acts 19:12]]
*Paul Ministers in Ephesus*

[[Acts.19.8|8]] And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.

8: 

[[Acts.19.9|9]] But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.

9: 

[[Acts.19.10|10]] And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.

10: 

[[Acts.19.11|11]] And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:

11: 

[[Acts.19.12|12]] So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.

12:
