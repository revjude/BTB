[[Acts.4|Acts 4:1 - Acts 4:12]]
*Peter and John before the Sanhedrin*

[[Acts.4.1|1]] And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,

1: 

[[Acts.4.2|2]] Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.

2: 

[[Acts.4.3|3]] And they laid hands on them, and put \[them\] in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.

3: 

[[Acts.4.4|4]] Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.

4: 

[[Acts.4.5|5]] And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,

5: 

[[Acts.4.6|6]] And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.

6: 

[[Acts.4.7|7]] And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?

7: 

[[Acts.4.8|8]] Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,

8: 

[[Acts.4.9|9]] If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;

9: 

[[Acts.4.10|10]] Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, \[even\] by him doth this man stand here before you whole.

10: 

[[Acts.4.11|11]] This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.

11: 

[[Acts.4.12|12]] Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

12:
