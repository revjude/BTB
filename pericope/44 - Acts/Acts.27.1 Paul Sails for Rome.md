[[Acts.27|Acts 27:1 - Acts 27:12]]
*Paul Sails for Rome*

[[Acts.27.1|1]] And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto \[one\] named Julius, a centurion of Augustus’ band.

1: 

[[Acts.27.2|2]] And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; \[one\] Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.

2: 

[[Acts.27.3|3]] And the next \[day\] we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave \[him\] liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.

3: 

[[Acts.27.4|4]] And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.

4: 

[[Acts.27.5|5]] And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, \[a city\] of Lycia.

5: 

[[Acts.27.6|6]] And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.

6: 

[[Acts.27.7|7]] And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;

7: 

[[Acts.27.8|8]] And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city \[of\] Lasea.

8: 

[[Acts.27.9|9]] Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished \[them\],

9: 

[[Acts.27.10|10]] And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.

10: 

[[Acts.27.11|11]] Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.

11: 

[[Acts.27.12|12]] And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, \[and there\] to winter; \[which is\] an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.

12:
