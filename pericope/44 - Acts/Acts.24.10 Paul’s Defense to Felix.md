[[Acts.24|Acts 24:10 - Acts 24:21]]
*Paul’s Defense to Felix*

[[Acts.24.10|10]] Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:

10: 

[[Acts.24.11|11]] Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.

11: 

[[Acts.24.12|12]] And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:

12: 

[[Acts.24.13|13]] Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.

13: 

[[Acts.24.14|14]] But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:

14: 

[[Acts.24.15|15]] And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.

15: 

[[Acts.24.16|16]] And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and \[toward\] men.

16: 

[[Acts.24.17|17]] Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.

17: 

[[Acts.24.18|18]] Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.

18: 

[[Acts.24.19|19]] Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.

19: 

[[Acts.24.20|20]] Or else let these same \[here\] say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,

20: 

[[Acts.24.21|21]] Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.

21:
