[[Acts.7|Acts 7:30 - Acts 7:38]]
*The Call of Moses*

[[Acts.7.30|30]] And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.

30: 

[[Acts.7.31|31]] When Moses saw \[it\], he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold \[it\], the voice of the Lord came unto him,

31:

36: 

[[Acts.7.37|37]] This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.

37: 

[[Acts.7.38|38]] This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and \[with\] our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:
