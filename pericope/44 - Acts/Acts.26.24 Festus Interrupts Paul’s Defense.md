[[Acts.26|Acts 26:24 - Acts 26:32]]
*Festus Interrupts Paul’s Defense*

[[Acts.26.24|24]] And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.

24: 

[[Acts.26.25|25]] But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.

25: 

[[Acts.26.26|26]] For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.

26: 

[[Acts.26.27|27]] King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.

27: 

[[Acts.26.28|28]] Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.

28: 

[[Acts.26.29|29]] And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.

29: 

[[Acts.26.30|30]] And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:

30: 

[[Acts.26.31|31]] And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.

31: 

[[Acts.26.32|32]] Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.

32:
