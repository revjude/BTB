[[Acts.15|Acts 15:5 - Acts 15:21]]
*The Council at Jerusalem*

[[Acts.15.5|5]] But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command \[them\] to keep the law of Moses.

5: 

[[Acts.15.6|6]] And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.

6: 

[[Acts.15.7|7]] And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men \[and\] brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.

7: 

[[Acts.15.8|8]] And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as \[he did\] unto us;

8: 

[[Acts.15.9|9]] And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.

9: 

[[Acts.15.10|10]] Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?

10: 

[[Acts.15.11|11]] But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.

11: 

[[Acts.15.12|12]] Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.

12: 

[[Acts.15.13|13]] And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men \[and\] brethren, hearken unto me:

13: 

[[Acts.15.14|14]] Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.

14: 

[[Acts.15.15|15]] And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,

15: 

[[Acts.15.16|16]] After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:

16: 

[[Acts.15.17|17]] That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.

17: 

[[Acts.15.18|18]] Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.

18: 

[[Acts.15.19|19]] Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:

19: 

[[Acts.15.20|20]] But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and \[from\] fornication, and \[from\] things strangled, and \[from\] blood.

20: 

[[Acts.15.21|21]] For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.

21:
