[[Acts.24|Acts 24:22 - Acts 24:27]]
*The Verdict Postponed*

[[Acts.24.22|22]] And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of \[that\] way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.

22: 

[[Acts.24.23|23]] And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let \[him\] have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.

23: 

[[Acts.24.24|24]] And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.

24: 

[[Acts.24.25|25]] And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.

25: 

[[Acts.24.26|26]] He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.

26: 

[[Acts.24.27|27]] But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix’ room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.
