[[Acts.13|Acts 13:4 - Acts 13:12]]
*On Cyprus*

[[Acts.13.4|4]] So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.

4: 

[[Acts.13.5|5]] And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to \[their\] minister.

5: 

[[Acts.13.6|6]] And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name \[was\] Barjesus:

6: 

[[Acts.13.7|7]] Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.

7: 

[[Acts.13.8|8]] But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.

8: 

[[Acts.13.9|9]] Then Saul, (who also \[is called\] Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,

9: 

[[Acts.13.10|10]] And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, \[thou\] child of the devil, \[thou\] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?

10: 

[[Acts.13.11|11]] And now, behold, the hand of the Lord \[is\] upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.

11: 

[[Acts.13.12|12]] Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.

12:
