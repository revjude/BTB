[[Acts.11|Acts 11:19 - Acts 11:30]]
*The Church at Antioch*

[[Acts.11.19|19]] Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.

19: 

[[Acts.11.20|20]] And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.

20: 

[[Acts.11.21|21]] And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.

21: 

[[Acts.11.22|22]] Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.

22: 

[[Acts.11.23|23]] Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.

23: 

[[Acts.11.24|24]] For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.

24: 

[[Acts.11.25|25]] Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:

25: 

[[Acts.11.26|26]] And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.

26: 

[[Acts.11.27|27]] And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.

27: 

[[Acts.11.28|28]] And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.

28: 

[[Acts.11.29|29]] Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:

29: 

[[Acts.11.30|30]] Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.

30:
