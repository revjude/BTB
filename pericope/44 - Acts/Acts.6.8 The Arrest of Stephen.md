[[Acts.6|Acts 6:8 - Acts 6:15]]
*The Arrest of Stephen*

[[Acts.6.8|8]] And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.

8: 

[[Acts.6.9|9]] Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called \[the synagogue\] of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.

9: 

[[Acts.6.10|10]] And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.

10: 

[[Acts.6.11|11]] Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and \[against\] God.

11: 

[[Acts.6.12|12]] And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon \[him\], and caught him, and brought \[him\] to the council,

12: 

[[Acts.6.13|13]] And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:

13: 

[[Acts.6.14|14]] For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.

14: 

[[Acts.6.15|15]] And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.

15:
