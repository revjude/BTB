[[Acts.27|Acts 27:13 - Acts 27:26]]
*The Storm at Sea*

[[Acts.27.13|13]] And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained \[their\] purpose, loosing \[thence\], they sailed close by Crete.

13: 

[[Acts.27.14|14]] But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.

14: 

[[Acts.27.15|15]] And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let \[her\] drive.

15: 

[[Acts.27.16|16]] And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:

16: 

[[Acts.27.17|17]] Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.

17: 

[[Acts.27.18|18]] And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next \[day\] they lightened the ship;

18: 

[[Acts.27.19|19]] And the third \[day\] we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.

19: 

[[Acts.27.20|20]] And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on \[us\], all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.

20: 

[[Acts.27.21|21]] But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.

21: 

[[Acts.27.22|22]] And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of \[any man’s\] life among you, but of the ship.

22: 

[[Acts.27.23|23]] For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,

23: 

[[Acts.27.24|24]] Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.

24: 

[[Acts.27.25|25]] Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.

25: 

[[Acts.27.26|26]] Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.

26:
