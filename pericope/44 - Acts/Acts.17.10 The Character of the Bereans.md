10: 

[[Acts.17.11|11]] These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.

11: 

[[Acts.17.12|12]] Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.

12: 

[[Acts.17.13|13]] But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.

[[Acts.17.14|14]] And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.

14: 

[[Acts.17.15|15]] And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.
