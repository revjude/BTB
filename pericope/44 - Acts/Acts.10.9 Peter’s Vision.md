[[Acts.10|Acts 10:9 - Acts 10:16]]
*Peter’s Vision*

[[Acts.10.9|9]] On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:

9: 

[[Acts.10.10|10]] And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,

10: 

[[Acts.10.11|11]] And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:

11: 

[[Acts.10.12|12]] Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.

12: 

[[Acts.10.13|13]] And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.

13: 

[[Acts.10.14|14]] But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.

14: 

[[Acts.10.15|15]] And the voice \[spake\] unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, \[that\] call not thou common.

15: 

[[Acts.10.16|16]] This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.

16:
