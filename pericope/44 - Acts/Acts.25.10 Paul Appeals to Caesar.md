[[Acts.25|Acts 25:10 - Acts 25:12]]
*Paul Appeals to Caesar*

[[Acts.25.10|10]] Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.

10: 

[[Acts.25.11|11]] For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.

11: 

[[Acts.25.12|12]] Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.

12:
