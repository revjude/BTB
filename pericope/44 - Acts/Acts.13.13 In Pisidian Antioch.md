[[Acts.13|Acts 13:13 - Acts 13:41]]
*In Pisidian Antioch*

[[Acts.13.13|13]] Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.

13: 

[[Acts.13.14|14]] But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.

14: 

[[Acts.13.15|15]] And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, \[Ye\] men \[and\] brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.

15: 

[[Acts.13.16|16]] Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with \[his\] hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.

16: 

[[Acts.13.17|17]] The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.

17: 

[[Acts.13.18|18]] And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.

18: 

[[Acts.13.19|19]] And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.

19: 

[[Acts.13.20|20]] And after that he gave \[unto them\] judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.

20: 

[[Acts.13.21|21]] And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.

21: 

[[Acts.13.22|22]] And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the \[son\] of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.

22: 

[[Acts.13.23|23]] Of this man’s seed hath God according to \[his\] promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:

23: 

[[Acts.13.24|24]] When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.

24: 

[[Acts.13.25|25]] And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not \[he\]. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of \[his\] feet I am not worthy to loose.

25: 

[[Acts.13.26|26]] Men \[and\] brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.

26: 

[[Acts.13.27|27]] For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled \[them\] in condemning \[him\].

27: 

[[Acts.13.28|28]] And though they found no cause of death \[in him\], yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.

28: 

[[Acts.13.29|29]] And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took \[him\] down from the tree, and laid \[him\] in a sepulchre.

29: 

[[Acts.13.30|30]] But God raised him from the dead:

30: 

[[Acts.13.31|31]] And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.

31: 

[[Acts.13.32|32]] And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,

32: 

[[Acts.13.33|33]] God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.

33: 

[[Acts.13.34|34]] And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, \[now\] no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.

34: 

[[Acts.13.35|35]] Wherefore he saith also in another \[psalm\], Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.

35: 

[[Acts.13.36|36]] For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:

36: 

[[Acts.13.37|37]] But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.

37: 

[[Acts.13.38|38]] Be it known unto you therefore, men \[and\] brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:

38: 

[[Acts.13.39|39]] And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.

39: 

[[Acts.13.40|40]] Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;

40: 

[[Acts.13.41|41]] Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.

41:
