[[Acts.10|Acts 10:24 - Acts 10:33]]
*Peter Visits Cornelius*

[[Acts.10.24|24]] And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.

24: 

[[Acts.10.25|25]] And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped \[him\].

25: 

[[Acts.10.26|26]] But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.

26: 

[[Acts.10.27|27]] And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.

27: 

[[Acts.10.28|28]] And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.

28: 

[[Acts.10.29|29]] Therefore came I \[unto you\] without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?

29: 

[[Acts.10.30|30]] And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,

30: 

[[Acts.10.31|31]] And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.

31: 

[[Acts.10.32|32]] Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of \[one\] Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.

32: 

[[Acts.10.33|33]] Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.
