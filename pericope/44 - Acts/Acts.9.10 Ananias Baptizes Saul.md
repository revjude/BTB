[[Acts.9|Acts 9:10 - Acts 9:19]]
*Ananias Baptizes Saul*

[[Acts.9.10|10]] And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I \[am here\], Lord.

10: 

[[Acts.9.11|11]] And the Lord \[said\] unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for \[one\] called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,

11: 

[[Acts.9.12|12]] And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting \[his\] hand on him, that he might receive his sight.

12: 

[[Acts.9.13|13]] Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:

13: 

[[Acts.9.14|14]] And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.

14: 

[[Acts.9.15|15]] But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:

15: 

[[Acts.9.16|16]] For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name’s sake.

16: 

[[Acts.9.17|17]] And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, \[even\] Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.

17: 

[[Acts.9.18|18]] And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.

18: 

[[Acts.9.19|19]] And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.
