[[Acts.2|Acts 2:42 - Acts 2:47]]
*The Fellowship of Believers*

[[Acts.2.42|42]] And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.

42: 

[[Acts.2.43|43]] And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.

43: 

[[Acts.2.44|44]] And all that believed were together, and had all things common;

44: 

[[Acts.2.45|45]] And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all \[men\], as every man had need.

45: 

[[Acts.2.46|46]] And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,

46: 

[[Acts.2.47|47]] Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.

47:
