[[Acts.25|Acts 25:23 - Acts 25:27]]
*Paul before Agrippa and Bernice*

[[Acts.25.23|23]] And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus’ commandment Paul was brought forth.

23: 

[[Acts.25.24|24]] And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and \[also\] here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.

24: 

[[Acts.25.25|25]] But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.

25: 

[[Acts.25.26|26]] Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.

26: 

[[Acts.25.27|27]] For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes \[laid\] against him.
