[[Acts.9|Acts 9:36 - Acts 9:43]]
*The Raising of Tabitha*

[[Acts.9.36|36]] Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.

36: 

[[Acts.9.37|37]] And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid \[her\] in an upper chamber.

37: 

[[Acts.9.38|38]] And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring \[him\] that he would not delay to come to them.

38: 

[[Acts.9.39|39]] Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.

39: 

[[Acts.9.40|40]] But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning \[him\] to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.

40: 

[[Acts.9.41|41]] And he gave her \[his\] hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.

41: 

[[Acts.9.42|42]] And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.

42: 

[[Acts.9.43|43]] And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.

43:
