[[Acts.20|Acts 20:17 - Acts 20:38]]
*Paul’s Farewell to the Ephesians*

[[Acts.20.17|17]] And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.

17: 

[[Acts.20.18|18]] And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,

18: 

[[Acts.20.19|19]] Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:

19: 

[[Acts.20.20|20]] \[And\] how I kept back nothing that was profitable \[unto you\], but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,

20: 

[[Acts.20.21|21]] Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.

21: 

[[Acts.20.22|22]] And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:

22: 

[[Acts.20.23|23]] Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.

23: 

[[Acts.20.24|24]] But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.

24: 

[[Acts.20.25|25]] And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.

25: 

[[Acts.20.26|26]] Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I \[am\] pure from the blood of all \[men\].

26: 

[[Acts.20.27|27]] For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.

27: 

[[Acts.20.28|28]] Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.

28: 

[[Acts.20.29|29]] For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.

29: 

[[Acts.20.30|30]] Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.

30: 

[[Acts.20.31|31]] Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.

31: 

[[Acts.20.32|32]] And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.

32: 

[[Acts.20.33|33]] I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.

33: 

[[Acts.20.34|34]] Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.

34: 

[[Acts.20.35|35]] I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.

35: 

[[Acts.20.36|36]] And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.

36: 

[[Acts.20.37|37]] And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him,

37: 

[[Acts.20.38|38]] Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.

38:
