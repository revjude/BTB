[[Acts.28|Acts 28:1 - Acts 28:10]]
*Ashore on Malta*

[[Acts.28.1|1]] And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.

1: 

[[Acts.28.2|2]] And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.

2: 

[[Acts.28.3|3]] And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid \[them\] on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.

3: 

[[Acts.28.4|4]] And when the barbarians saw the \[venomous\] beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.

4: 

[[Acts.28.5|5]] And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.

5: 

[[Acts.28.6|6]] Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.

6: 

[[Acts.28.7|7]] In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.

7: 

[[Acts.28.8|8]] And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.

8: 

[[Acts.28.9|9]] So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:

9: 

[[Acts.28.10|10]] Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded \[us\] with such things as were necessary.
