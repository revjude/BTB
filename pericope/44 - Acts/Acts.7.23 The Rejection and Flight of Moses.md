[[Acts.7|Acts 7:23 - Acts 7:29]]
*The Rejection and Flight of Moses*

[[Acts.7.23|23]] And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.

23: 

[[Acts.7.24|24]] And seeing one \[of them\] suffer wrong, he defended \[him\], and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:

24: 

[[Acts.7.25|25]] For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.

25: 

[[Acts.7.26|26]] And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?

26: 

[[Acts.7.27|27]] But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?

27: 

[[Acts.7.28|28]] Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?

28: 

[[Acts.7.29|29]] Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.

29:
