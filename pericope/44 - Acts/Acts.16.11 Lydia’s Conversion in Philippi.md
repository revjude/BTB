[[Acts.16|Acts 16:11 - Acts 16:15]]
*Lydia’s Conversion in Philippi*

[[Acts.16.11|11]] Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next \[day\] to Neapolis;

11: 

[[Acts.16.12|12]] And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, \[and\] a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.

12: 

[[Acts.16.13|13]] And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted \[thither\].

13: 

[[Acts.16.14|14]] And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard \[us\]: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.

14: 

[[Acts.16.15|15]] And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought \[us\], saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide \[there\]. And she constrained us.

15:
