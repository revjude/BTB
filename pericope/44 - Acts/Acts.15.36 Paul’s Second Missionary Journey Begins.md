[[Acts.15|Acts 15:36 - Acts 15:41]]
*Paul’s Second Missionary Journey Begins*

[[Acts.15.36|36]] And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, \[and see\] how they do.

36: 

[[Acts.15.37|37]] And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.

37: 

[[Acts.15.38|38]] But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.

38: 

[[Acts.15.39|39]] And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;

39: 

[[Acts.15.40|40]] And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.

40: 

[[Acts.15.41|41]] And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
