[[Acts.2|Acts 2:1 - Acts 2:13]]
*The Holy Spirit at Pentecost*

[[Acts.2.1|1]] And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.

1: 

[[Acts.2.2|2]] And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.

2: 

[[Acts.2.3|3]] And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.

3: 

[[Acts.2.4|4]] And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.

4: 

[[Acts.2.5|5]] And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.

5: 

[[Acts.2.6|6]] Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.

6: 

[[Acts.2.7|7]] And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?

7: 

[[Acts.2.8|8]] And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?

8: 

[[Acts.2.9|9]] Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,

9: 

[[Acts.2.10|10]] Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,

10: 

[[Acts.2.11|11]] Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.

11: 

[[Acts.2.12|12]] And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?

12: 

[[Acts.2.13|13]] Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.

13:
