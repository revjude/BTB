[[Acts.5|Acts 5:24 - Acts 5:32]]
*The Apostles before the Sanhedrin*

[[Acts.5.24|24]] Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.

24: 

[[Acts.5.25|25]] Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.

25: 

[[Acts.5.26|26]] Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.

26: 

[[Acts.5.27|27]] And when they had brought them, they set \[them\] before the council: and the high priest asked them,

27: 

[[Acts.5.28|28]] Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.

28: 

[[Acts.5.29|29]] Then Peter and the \[other\] apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.

29: 

[[Acts.5.30|30]] The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.

30: 

[[Acts.5.31|31]] Him hath God exalted with his right hand \[to be\] a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.

31: 

[[Acts.5.32|32]] And we are his witnesses of these things; and \[so is\] also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.

32:
