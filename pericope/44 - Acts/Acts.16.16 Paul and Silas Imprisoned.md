[[Acts.16|Acts 16:16 - Acts 16:24]]
*Paul and Silas Imprisoned*

[[Acts.16.16|16]] And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:

16: 

[[Acts.16.17|17]] The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.

17: 

[[Acts.16.18|18]] And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.

18: 

[[Acts.16.19|19]] And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew \[them\] into the marketplace unto the rulers,

19: 

[[Acts.16.20|20]] And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,

20: 

[[Acts.16.21|21]] And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.

21: 

[[Acts.16.22|22]] And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat \[them\].

22: 

[[Acts.16.23|23]] And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast \[them\] into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:

23: 

[[Acts.16.24|24]] Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.

24:
