[[Acts.7|Acts 7:39 - Acts 7:43]]
*The Rebellion of Israel*

[[Acts.7.39|39]] To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust \[him\] from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,

39: 

[[Acts.7.40|40]] Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for \[as for\] this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.

40: 

[[Acts.7.41|41]] And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.

41: 

[[Acts.7.42|42]] Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices \[by the space of\] forty years in the wilderness?

42: 

[[Acts.7.43|43]] Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.

43:
