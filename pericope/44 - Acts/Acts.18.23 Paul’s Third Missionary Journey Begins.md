26: 

[[Acts.18.27|27]] And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:

27: 

[[Acts.18.28|28]] For he mightily convinced the Jews, \[and that\] publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.
