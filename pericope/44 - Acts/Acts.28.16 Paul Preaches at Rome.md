[[Acts.28|Acts 28:16 - Acts 28:31]]
*Paul Preaches at Rome*

[[Acts.28.16|16]] And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.

16: 

[[Acts.28.17|17]] And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men \[and\] brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.

17: 

[[Acts.28.18|18]] Who, when they had examined me, would have let \[me\] go, because there was no cause of death in me.

18: 

[[Acts.28.19|19]] But when the Jews spake against \[it\], I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.

19: 

[[Acts.28.20|20]] For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see \[you\], and to speak with \[you\]: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.

20: 

[[Acts.28.21|21]] And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.

21: 

[[Acts.28.22|22]] But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.

22: 

[[Acts.28.23|23]] And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into \[his\] lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and \[out of\] the prophets, from morning till evening.

23: 

[[Acts.28.24|24]] And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.

24: 

[[Acts.28.25|25]] And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,

25: 

[[Acts.28.26|26]] Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:

26: 

[[Acts.28.27|27]] For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with \[their\] eyes, and hear with \[their\] ears, and understand with \[their\] heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.

27: 

[[Acts.28.28|28]] Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and \[that\] they will hear it.

28: 

[[Acts.28.30|30]] And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,

30: 

[[Acts.28.31|31]] Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.

31:
