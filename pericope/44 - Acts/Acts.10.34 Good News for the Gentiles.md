[[Acts.10|Acts 10:34 - Acts 10:43]]
*Good News for the Gentiles*

[[Acts.10.34|34]] Then Peter opened \[his\] mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:

34: 

[[Acts.10.35|35]] But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.

35: 

[[Acts.10.36|36]] The word which \[God\] sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)

36: 

[[Acts.10.37|37]] That word, \[I say\], ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;

37: 

[[Acts.10.38|38]] How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.

38: 

[[Acts.10.39|39]] And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:

39: 

[[Acts.10.40|40]] Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;

40: 

[[Acts.10.41|41]] Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, \[even\] to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.

41: 

[[Acts.10.42|42]] And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God \[to be\] the Judge of quick and dead.

42: 

[[Acts.10.43|43]] To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.

43:
