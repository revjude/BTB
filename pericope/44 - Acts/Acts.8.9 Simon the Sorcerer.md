[[Acts.8|Acts 8:9 - Acts 8:25]]
*Simon the Sorcerer*

[[Acts.8.9|9]] But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:

9: 

[[Acts.8.10|10]] To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.

10: 

[[Acts.8.11|11]] And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.

11: 

[[Acts.8.12|12]] But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.

12: 

[[Acts.8.13|13]] Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.

13: 

[[Acts.8.14|14]] Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:

14: 

[[Acts.8.15|15]] Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:

15: 

[[Acts.8.16|16]] (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)

16: 

[[Acts.8.17|17]] Then laid they \[their\] hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.

17: 

[[Acts.8.18|18]] And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,

18: 

[[Acts.8.19|19]] Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.

19: 

[[Acts.8.20|20]] But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.

20: 

[[Acts.8.21|21]] Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.

21: 

[[Acts.8.22|22]] Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.

22: 

[[Acts.8.23|23]] For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and \[in\] the bond of iniquity.

23: 

[[Acts.8.24|24]] Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.

24: 

[[Acts.8.25|25]] And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
