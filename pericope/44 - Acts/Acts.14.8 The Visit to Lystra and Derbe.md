[[Acts.14|Acts 14:8 - Acts 14:20]]
*The Visit to Lystra and Derbe*

[[Acts.14.8|8]] And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother’s womb, who never had walked:

8: 

[[Acts.14.9|9]] The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,

9: 

[[Acts.14.10|10]] Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.

10: 

[[Acts.14.11|11]] And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.

11: 

[[Acts.14.12|12]] And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.

12: 

[[Acts.14.13|13]] Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.

13: 

[[Acts.14.14|14]] \[Which\] when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard \[of\], they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,

14: 

[[Acts.14.15|15]] And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:

15: 

[[Acts.14.16|16]] Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.

16: 

[[Acts.14.17|17]] Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.

17: 

[[Acts.14.18|18]] And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them.

18: 

[[Acts.14.19|19]] And there came thither \[certain\] Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew \[him\] out of the city, supposing he had been dead.

19: 

[[Acts.14.20|20]] Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.

20:
