[[Acts.5|Acts 5:17 - Acts 5:23]]
*The Apostles Arrested and Freed*

[[Acts.5.17|17]] Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,

17: 

[[Acts.5.18|18]] And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.

18: 

[[Acts.5.19|19]] But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,

19: 

[[Acts.5.20|20]] Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.

20: 

[[Acts.5.21|21]] And when they heard \[that\], they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.

21: 

[[Acts.5.22|22]] But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,

22: 

[[Acts.5.23|23]] Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.

23:
