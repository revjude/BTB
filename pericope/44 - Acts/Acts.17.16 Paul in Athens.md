[[Acts.17|Acts 17:16 - Acts 17:21]]
*Paul in Athens*

[[Acts.17.16|16]] Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.

16: 

[[Acts.17.17|17]] Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.

17: 

[[Acts.17.18|18]] Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.

18: 

[[Acts.17.19|19]] And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, \[is\]?

19: 

[[Acts.17.20|20]] For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.

20: 

[[Acts.17.21|21]] (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)

21:
