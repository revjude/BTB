[[Acts.9|Acts 9:1 - Acts 9:9]]
*The Road to Damascus*

[[Acts.9.1|1]] And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,

1: 

[[Acts.9.2|2]] And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.

2: 

[[Acts.9.3|3]] And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:

3: 

[[Acts.9.4|4]] And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

4: 

[[Acts.9.5|5]] And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: \[it is\] hard for thee to kick against the pricks.

5: 

[[Acts.9.6|6]] And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord \[said\] unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.

6: 

[[Acts.9.7|7]] And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.

7: 

[[Acts.9.8|8]] And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought \[him\] into Damascus.

8: 

[[Acts.9.9|9]] And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.

9:
