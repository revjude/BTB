[[Acts.28|Acts 28:11 - Acts 28:15]]
*Paul Arrives in Italy*

[[Acts.28.11|11]] And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.

11: 

[[Acts.28.12|12]] And landing at Syracuse, we tarried \[there\] three days.

12: 

[[Acts.28.13|13]] And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:

13: 

[[Acts.28.14|14]] Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.

14: 

[[Acts.28.15|15]] And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.

15:
