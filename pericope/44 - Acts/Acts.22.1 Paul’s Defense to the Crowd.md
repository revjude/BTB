[[Acts.22|Acts 22:1 - Acts 22:21]]
*Paul’s Defense to the Crowd*

[[Acts.22.1|1]] Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence \[which I make\] now unto you.

1: 

[[Acts.22.2|2]] (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)

2: 

[[Acts.22.3|3]] I am verily a man \[which am\] a Jew, born in Tarsus, \[a city\] in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, \[and\] taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.

3: 

[[Acts.22.4|4]] And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.

4: 

[[Acts.22.5|5]] As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.

5: 

[[Acts.22.6|6]] And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.

6: 

[[Acts.22.7|7]] And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

7: 

[[Acts.22.8|8]] And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.

8: 

[[Acts.22.9|9]] And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.

9: 

[[Acts.22.10|10]] And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.

10: 

[[Acts.22.11|11]] And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.

11: 

[[Acts.22.12|12]] And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt \[there\],

12: 

[[Acts.22.13|13]] Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.

13: 

[[Acts.22.14|14]] And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.

14: 

[[Acts.22.15|15]] For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.

15: 

[[Acts.22.16|16]] And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.

16: 

[[Acts.22.17|17]] And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;

17: 

[[Acts.22.18|18]] And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.

18: 

[[Acts.22.19|19]] And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:

19: 

[[Acts.22.20|20]] And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.

20: 

[[Acts.22.21|21]] And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.

21:
