[[Acts.2|Acts 2:37 - Acts 2:41]]
*Three Thousand Believe*

[[Acts.2.37|37]] Now when they heard \[this\], they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men \[and\] brethren, what shall we do?

37: 

[[Acts.2.38|38]] Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

38: 

[[Acts.2.39|39]] For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, \[even\] as many as the Lord our God shall call.

39: 

[[Acts.2.40|40]] And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.

40: 

[[Acts.2.41|41]] Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added \[unto them\] about three thousand souls.

41:
