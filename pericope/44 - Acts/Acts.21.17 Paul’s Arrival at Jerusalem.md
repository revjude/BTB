[[Acts.21|Acts 21:17 - Acts 21:26]]
*Paul’s Arrival at Jerusalem*

[[Acts.21.17|17]] And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.

17: 

[[Acts.21.18|18]] And the \[day\] following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.

18: 

[[Acts.21.19|19]] And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.

19: 

[[Acts.21.20|20]] And when they heard \[it\], they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:

20: 

[[Acts.21.21|21]] And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise \[their\] children, neither to walk after the customs.

21: 

[[Acts.21.22|22]] What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.

22: 

[[Acts.21.23|23]] Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;

23: 

[[Acts.21.24|24]] Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave \[their\] heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but \[that\] thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.

24: 

[[Acts.21.25|25]] As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written \[and\] concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from \[things\] offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.

25: 

[[Acts.21.26|26]] Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.

26:
