[[Acts.7|Acts 7:1 - Acts 7:8]]
*Stephen’s Address：The Call of Abraham*

[[Acts.7.1|1]] Then said the high priest, Are these things so?

1: 

[[Acts.7.2|2]] And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,

2: 

[[Acts.7.3|3]] And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.

3: 

[[Acts.7.4|4]] Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.

4: 

[[Acts.7.5|5]] And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not \[so much as\] to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when \[as yet\] he had no child.

5: 

[[Acts.7.6|6]] And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat \[them\] evil four hundred years.

6: 

[[Acts.7.7|7]] And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.

7: 

[[Acts.7.8|8]] And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so \[Abraham\] begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac \[begat\] Jacob; and Jacob \[begat\] the twelve patriarchs.

8:
