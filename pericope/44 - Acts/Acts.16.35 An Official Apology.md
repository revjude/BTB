[[Acts.16|Acts 16:35 - Acts 16:40]]
*An Official Apology*

[[Acts.16.35|35]] And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.

35: 

[[Acts.16.36|36]] And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.

36: 

[[Acts.16.37|37]] But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast \[us\] into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.

37: 

[[Acts.16.38|38]] And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.

38: 

[[Acts.16.39|39]] And they came and besought them, and brought \[them\] out, and desired \[them\] to depart out of the city.

39: 

[[Acts.16.40|40]] And they went out of the prison, and entered into \[the house of\] Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.

40:
