[[Acts.26|Acts 26:1 - Acts 26:23]]
*Paul’s Testimony to Agrippa*

[[Acts.26.1|1]] Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:

1: 

[[Acts.26.2|2]] I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:

2: 

[[Acts.26.3|3]] Especially \[because I know\] thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.

3: 

[[Acts.26.4|4]] My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;

4: 

[[Acts.26.5|5]] Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.

5: 

[[Acts.26.6|6]] And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:

6: 

[[Acts.26.7|7]] Unto which \[promise\] our twelve tribes, instantly serving \[God\] day and night, hope to come. For which hope’s sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.

7: 

[[Acts.26.8|8]] Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?

8: 

[[Acts.26.9|9]] I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.

9: 

[[Acts.26.10|10]] Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against \[them\].

10: 

[[Acts.26.11|11]] And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled \[them\] to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted \[them\] even unto strange cities.

11: 

[[Acts.26.12|12]] Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,

12: 

[[Acts.26.13|13]] At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.

13: 

[[Acts.26.14|14]] And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? \[it is\] hard for thee to kick against the pricks.

14: 

[[Acts.26.15|15]] And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.

15: 

[[Acts.26.16|16]] But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;

16: 

[[Acts.26.17|17]] Delivering thee from the people, and \[from\] the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,

17: 

[[Acts.26.18|18]] To open their eyes, \[and\] to turn \[them\] from darkness to light, and \[from\] the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.

18: 

[[Acts.26.19|19]] Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:

19: 

[[Acts.26.20|20]] But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and \[then\] to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.

20: 

[[Acts.26.21|21]] For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill \[me\].

21: 

[[Acts.26.22|22]] Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:

22: 

[[Acts.26.23|23]] That Christ should suffer, \[and\] that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.

23:
