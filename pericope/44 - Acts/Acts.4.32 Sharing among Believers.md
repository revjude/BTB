[[Acts.4|Acts 4:32 - Acts 4:37]]
*Sharing among Believers*

[[Acts.4.32|32]] And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any \[of them\] that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.

32: 

[[Acts.4.33|33]] And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.

33: 

[[Acts.4.34|34]] Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,

34: 

[[Acts.4.35|35]] And laid \[them\] down at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.

35: 

[[Acts.4.36|36]] And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, \[and\] of the country of Cyprus,

36: 

[[Acts.4.37|37]] Having land, sold \[it\], and brought the money, and laid \[it\] at the apostles’ feet.
