[[Acts.14|Acts 14:1 - Acts 14:7]]
*Paul and Barnabas at Iconium*

[[Acts.14.1|1]] And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.

1: 

[[Acts.14.2|2]] But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren.

2: 

[[Acts.14.3|3]] Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.

3: 

[[Acts.14.4|4]] But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.

4: 

[[Acts.14.5|5]] And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use \[them\] despitefully, and to stone them,

5: 

[[Acts.14.6|6]] They were ware of \[it\], and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:

6: 

[[Acts.14.7|7]] And there they preached the gospel.

7:
