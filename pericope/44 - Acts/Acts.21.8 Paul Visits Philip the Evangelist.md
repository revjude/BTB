[[Acts.21|Acts 21:8 - Acts 21:16]]
*Paul Visits Philip the Evangelist*

[[Acts.21.8|8]] And the next \[day\] we that were of Paul’s company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was \[one\] of the seven; and abode with him.

8: 

[[Acts.21.9|9]] And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.

9: 

[[Acts.21.10|10]] And as we tarried \[there\] many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.

10: 

[[Acts.21.11|11]] And when he was come unto us, he took Paul’s girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver \[him\] into the hands of the Gentiles.

11: 

[[Acts.21.12|12]] And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.

12: 

[[Acts.21.13|13]] Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.

13: 

[[Acts.21.14|14]] And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.

14: 

[[Acts.21.15|15]] And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.

15: 

[[Acts.21.16|16]] There went with us also \[certain\] of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.

16:
