[[Acts.12|Acts 12:20 - Acts 12:25]]
*The Death of Herod*

[[Acts.12.20|20]] And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king’s chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king’s \[country\].

20: 

[[Acts.12.21|21]] And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.

21: 

[[Acts.12.22|22]] And the people gave a shout, \[saying, It is\] the voice of a god, and not of a man.

22: 

[[Acts.12.23|23]] And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.

23: 

[[Acts.12.24|24]] But the word of God grew and multiplied.

24: 

[[Acts.12.25|25]] And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled \[their\] ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.
