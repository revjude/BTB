[[Acts.7|Acts 7:9 - Acts 7:14]]
*Joseph Sold into Egypt*

[[Acts.7.9|9]] And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,

9: 

[[Acts.7.10|10]] And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.

10: 

[[Acts.7.11|11]] Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.

11: 

[[Acts.7.12|12]] But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.

12: 

[[Acts.7.13|13]] And at the second \[time\] Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph’s kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.

13: 

[[Acts.7.14|14]] Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to \[him\], and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.
