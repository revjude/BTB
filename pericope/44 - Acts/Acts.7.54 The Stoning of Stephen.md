[[Acts.7|Acts 7:54 - Acts 7:60]]
*The Stoning of Stephen*

[[Acts.7.54|54]] When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with \[their\] teeth.

54: 

[[Acts.7.55|55]] But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,

55: 

[[Acts.7.56|56]] And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.

56: 

[[Acts.7.57|57]] Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,

57: 

[[Acts.7.58|58]] And cast \[him\] out of the city, and stoned \[him\]: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man’s feet, whose name was Saul.

58: 

[[Acts.7.59|59]] And they stoned Stephen, calling upon \[God\], and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.

59: 

[[Acts.7.60|60]] And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

60:
