[[Acts.18|Acts 18:1 - Acts 18:11]]
*Paul Ministers in Corinth*

[[Acts.18.1|1]] After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;

1: 

[[Acts.18.2|2]] And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.

2: 

[[Acts.18.3|3]] And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.

3: 

[[Acts.18.4|4]] And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.

4: 

[[Acts.18.5|5]] And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews \[that\] Jesus \[was\] Christ.

5: 

[[Acts.18.6|6]] And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook \[his\] raiment, and said unto them, Your blood \[be\] upon your own heads; I \[am\] clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.

6: 

[[Acts.18.7|7]] And he departed thence, and entered into a certain \[man’s\] house, named Justus, \[one\] that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.

7: 

[[Acts.18.8|8]] And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.

8: 

[[Acts.18.9|9]] Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:

9: 

[[Acts.18.10|10]] For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.

10: 

[[Acts.18.11|11]] And he continued \[there\] a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.

11:
