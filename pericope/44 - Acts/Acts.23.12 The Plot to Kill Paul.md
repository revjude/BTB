[[Acts.23|Acts 23:12 - Acts 23:22]]
*The Plot to Kill Paul*

[[Acts.23.12|12]] And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.

12: 

[[Acts.23.13|13]] And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.

13: 

[[Acts.23.14|14]] And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.

14: 

[[Acts.23.15|15]] Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.

15: 

[[Acts.23.16|16]] And when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.

16: 

[[Acts.23.17|17]] Then Paul called one of the centurions unto \[him\], and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.

17: 

[[Acts.23.18|18]] So he took him, and brought \[him\] to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto \[him\], and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.

18: 

[[Acts.23.19|19]] Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went \[with him\] aside privately, and asked \[him\], What is that thou hast to tell me?

19: 

[[Acts.23.20|20]] And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly.

20: 

[[Acts.23.21|21]] But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.

21: 

[[Acts.23.22|22]] So the chief captain \[then\] let the young man depart, and charged \[him, See thou\] tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.

22:
