12: 

[[Acts.18.13|13]] Saying, This \[fellow\] persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.

13: 

[[Acts.18.14|14]] And when Paul was now about to open \[his\] mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O \[ye\] Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:

14: 

[[Acts.18.15|15]] But if it be a question of words and names, and \[of\] your law, look ye \[to it\]; for I will be no judge of such \[matters\].
