[[Acts.6|Acts 6:1 - Acts 6:7]]
*The Choosing of the Seven*

[[Acts.6.1|1]] And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.

1: 

[[Acts.6.2|2]] Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples \[unto them\], and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.

2: 

[[Acts.6.3|3]] Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.

3: 

[[Acts.6.4|4]] But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.

[[Acts.6.5|5]] And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:

5: 

[[Acts.6.6|6]] Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid \[their\] hands on them.

6: 

[[Acts.6.7|7]] And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
