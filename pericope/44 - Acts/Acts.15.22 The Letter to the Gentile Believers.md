[[Acts.15|Acts 15:22 - Acts 15:29]]
*The Letter to the Gentile Believers*

[[Acts.15.22|22]] Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; \[namely\], Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:

22: 

[[Acts.15.23|23]] And they wrote \[letters\] by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren \[send\] greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:

23: 

[[Acts.15.24|24]] Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, \[Ye must\] be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no \[such\] commandment:

24: 

[[Acts.15.25|25]] It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,

25: 

[[Acts.15.26|26]] Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

26: 

[[Acts.15.27|27]] We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell \[you\] the same things by mouth.

27: 

[[Acts.15.28|28]] For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;

28: 

[[Acts.15.29|29]] That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.

29:
