[[Acts.18|Acts 18:18 - Acts 18:22]]
*Paul Returns to Antioch*

[[Acts.18.18|18]] And Paul \[after this\] tarried \[there\] yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn \[his\] head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.

18: 

[[Acts.18.19|19]] And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.

19: 

[[Acts.18.20|20]] When they desired \[him\] to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;

20: 

[[Acts.18.21|21]] But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.

21: 

[[Acts.18.22|22]] And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.

22:
