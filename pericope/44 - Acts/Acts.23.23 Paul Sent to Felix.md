[[Acts.23|Acts 23:23 - Acts 23:35]]
*Paul Sent to Felix*

[[Acts.23.23|23]] And he called unto \[him\] two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;

23: 

[[Acts.23.24|24]] And provide \[them\] beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring \[him\] safe unto Felix the governor.

24: 

[[Acts.23.25|25]] And he wrote a letter after this manner:

25: 

[[Acts.23.26|26]] Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix \[sendeth\] greeting.

26: 

[[Acts.23.27|27]] This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.

27: 

[[Acts.23.28|28]] And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:

28: 

[[Acts.23.29|29]] Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.

29: 

[[Acts.23.30|30]] And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what \[they had\] against him. Farewell.

30: 

[[Acts.23.31|31]] Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought \[him\] by night to Antipatris.

31: 

[[Acts.23.32|32]] On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:

32: 

[[Acts.23.33|33]] Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.

33: 

[[Acts.23.34|34]] And when the governor had read \[the letter\], he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that \[he was\] of Cilicia;

34: 

[[Acts.23.35|35]] I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s judgment hall.
