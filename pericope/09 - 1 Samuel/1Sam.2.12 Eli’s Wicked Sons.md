[[1Sam.2|1 Samuel 2:12 - 1 Samuel 2:26]]
*Eli’s Wicked Sons*

[[1Sam.2.12|12]] Now the sons of Eli \[were\] sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.

12: 

[[1Sam.2.13|13]] And the priests’ custom with the people \[was, that\], when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;

13: 

[[1Sam.2.14|14]] And he struck \[it\] into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.

14: 

[[1Sam.2.15|15]] Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.

15: 

[[1Sam.2.16|16]] And \[if\] any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and \[then\] take \[as much\] as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, \[Nay\]; but thou shalt give \[it me\] now: and if not, I will take \[it\] by force.

16: 

[[1Sam.2.17|17]] Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.

17: 

[[1Sam.2.18|18]] But Samuel ministered before the LORD, \[being\] a child, girded with a linen ephod.

18: 

[[1Sam.2.19|19]] Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought \[it\] to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.

19: 

[[1Sam.2.20|20]] And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.

20: 

[[1Sam.2.21|21]] And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.

21: 

[[1Sam.2.22|22]] Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled \[at\] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

22: 

[[1Sam.2.23|23]] And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.

23: 

[[1Sam.2.24|24]] Nay, my sons; for \[it is\] no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD’S people to transgress.

24: 

[[1Sam.2.25|25]] If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.

25: 

[[1Sam.2.26|26]] And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.

26:
