[[1Sam.11|1 Samuel 11:12 - 1 Samuel 11:15]]
*Saul Confirmed as King*

[[1Sam.11.12|12]] And the people said unto Samuel, Who \[is\] he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.

12: 

[[1Sam.11.13|13]] And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.

13: 

[[1Sam.11.14|14]] Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.

14: 

[[1Sam.11.15|15]] And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.

15:
