[[1Sam.26|1 Samuel 26:21 - 1 Samuel 26:25]]
*Saul Acknowledges His Sin*

[[1Sam.26.21|21]] Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.

21: 

[[1Sam.26.22|22]] And David answered and said, Behold the king’s spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.

22: 

[[1Sam.26.23|23]] The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the LORD delivered thee into \[my\] hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD’S anointed.

23: 

[[1Sam.26.24|24]] And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.

24: 

[[1Sam.26.25|25]] Then Saul said to David, Blessed \[be\] thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great \[things\], and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.

25:
