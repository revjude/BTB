[[1Sam.8|1 Samuel 8:1 - 1 Samuel 8:9]]
*Israel Demands a King*

[[1Sam.8.1|1]] And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.

1: 

[[1Sam.8.2|2]] Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: \[they were\] judges in Beersheba.

2: 

[[1Sam.8.3|3]] And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.

3: 

[[1Sam.8.4|4]] Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,

4: 

[[1Sam.8.5|5]] And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.

5: 

[[1Sam.8.6|6]] But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.

6: 

[[1Sam.8.7|7]] And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.

7: 

[[1Sam.8.8|8]] According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.

8: 

[[1Sam.8.9|9]] Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.

9:
