[[1Sam.13|1 Samuel 13:8 - 1 Samuel 13:15]]
*Saul’s Unlawful Sacrifice*

[[1Sam.13.8|8]] And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel \[had appointed\]: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.

8: 

[[1Sam.13.9|9]] And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.

9: 

[[1Sam.13.10|10]] And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.

10: 

[[1Sam.13.11|11]] And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and \[that\] thou camest not within the days appointed, and \[that\] the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;

11: 

[[1Sam.13.12|12]] Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.

12: 

[[1Sam.13.13|13]] And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.

13: 

[[1Sam.13.14|14]] But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him \[to be\] captain over his people, because thou hast not kept \[that\] which the LORD commanded thee.

14: 

[[1Sam.13.15|15]] And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people \[that were\] present with him, about six hundred men.

15:
