[[1Sam.30|1 Samuel 30:1 - 1 Samuel 30:6]]
*The Amalekites Raid Ziklag*

[[1Sam.30.1|1]] And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;

1: 

[[1Sam.30.2|2]] And had taken the women captives, that \[were\] therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried \[them\] away, and went on their way.

2: 

[[1Sam.30.3|3]] So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, \[it was\] burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.

3: 

[[1Sam.30.4|4]] Then David and the people that \[were\] with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.

4: 

[[1Sam.30.5|5]] And David’s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

5: 

[[1Sam.30.6|6]] And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.

6:
