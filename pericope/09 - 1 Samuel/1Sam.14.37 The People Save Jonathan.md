[[1Sam.14|1 Samuel 14:37 - 1 Samuel 14:46]]
*The People Save Jonathan*

[[1Sam.14.37|37]] And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.

37: 

[[1Sam.14.38|38]] And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.

38: 

[[1Sam.14.39|39]] For, \[as\] the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But \[there was\] not a man among all the people \[that\] answered him.

39: 

[[1Sam.14.40|40]] Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.

40: 

[[1Sam.14.41|41]] Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect \[lot\]. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.

41: 

[[1Sam.14.42|42]] And Saul said, Cast \[lots\] between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.

42: 

[[1Sam.14.43|43]] Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that \[was\] in mine hand, \[and\], lo, I must die.

43: 

[[1Sam.14.44|44]] And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.

44: 

[[1Sam.14.45|45]] And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: \[as\] the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.

45: 

[[1Sam.14.46|46]] Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.
