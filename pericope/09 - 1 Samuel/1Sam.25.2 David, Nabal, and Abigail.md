[[1Sam.25|1 Samuel 25:2 - 1 Samuel 25:17]]
*David, Nabal, and Abigail*

[[1Sam.25.2|2]] And \[there was\] a man in Maon, whose possessions \[were\] in Carmel; and the man \[was\] very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.

2: 

[[1Sam.25.3|3]] Now the name of the man \[was\] Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and \[she was\] a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man \[was\] churlish and evil in his doings; and he \[was\] of the house of Caleb.

3: 

[[1Sam.25.4|4]] And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.

4: 

[[1Sam.25.5|5]] And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:

5: 

[[1Sam.25.6|6]] And thus shall ye say to him that liveth \[in prosperity\], Peace \[be\] both to thee, and peace \[be\] to thine house, and peace \[be\] unto all that thou hast.

6: 

[[1Sam.25.7|7]] And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.

7: 

[[1Sam.25.8|8]] Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.

8: 

[[1Sam.25.9|9]] And when David’s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.

9: 

[[1Sam.25.10|10]] And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who \[is\] David? and who \[is\] the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.

10: 

[[1Sam.25.11|11]] Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give \[it\] unto men, whom I know not whence they \[be\]?

11: 

[[1Sam.25.12|12]] So David’s young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.

12: 

[[1Sam.25.13|13]] And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.

13: 

[[1Sam.25.14|14]] But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.

14: 

[[1Sam.25.15|15]] But the men \[were\] very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:

15: 

[[1Sam.25.16|16]] They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.

16: 

[[1Sam.25.17|17]] Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he \[is such\] a son of Belial, that \[a man\] cannot speak to him.

17:
