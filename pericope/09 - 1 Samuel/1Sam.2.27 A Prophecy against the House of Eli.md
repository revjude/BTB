[[1Sam.2|1 Samuel 2:27 - 1 Samuel 2:36]]
*A Prophecy against the House of Eli*

[[1Sam.2.27|27]] And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house?

27: 

[[1Sam.2.28|28]] And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel \[to be\] my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?

28: 

[[1Sam.2.29|29]] Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded \[in my\] habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?

29: 

[[1Sam.2.30|30]] Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed \[that\] thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.

30: 

[[1Sam.2.31|31]] Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.

31: 

[[1Sam.2.32|32]] And thou shalt see an enemy \[in my\] habitation, in all \[the wealth\] which \[God\] shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.

32: 

[[1Sam.2.33|33]] And the man of thine, \[whom\] I shall not cut off from mine altar, \[shall be\] to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.

33: 

[[1Sam.2.34|34]] And this \[shall be\] a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.

34: 

[[1Sam.2.35|35]] And I will raise me up a faithful priest, \[that\] shall do according to \[that\] which \[is\] in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.

35: 

[[1Sam.2.36|36]] And it shall come to pass, \[that\] every one that is left in thine house shall come \[and\] crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.

36:
