[[1Sam.10|1 Samuel 10:17 - 1 Samuel 10:27]]
*Saul Proclaimed King*

[[1Sam.10.17|17]] And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;

17: 

[[1Sam.10.18|18]] And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, \[and\] of them that oppressed you:

18: 

[[1Sam.10.19|19]] And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, \[Nay\], but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.

19: 

[[1Sam.10.20|20]] And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.

20: 

[[1Sam.10.21|21]] When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.

21: 

[[1Sam.10.22|22]] Therefore they inquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.

22: 

[[1Sam.10.23|23]] And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.

23: 

[[1Sam.10.24|24]] And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that \[there is\] none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.

24: 

[[1Sam.10.25|25]] Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote \[it\] in a book, and laid \[it\] up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.

25: 

[[1Sam.10.26|26]] And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.

26: 

[[1Sam.10.27|27]] But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace.

27:
