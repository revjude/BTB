[[1Sam.1|1 Samuel 1:19 - 1 Samuel 1:28]]
*The Birth of Samuel*

[[1Sam.1.19|19]] And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.

19: 

[[1Sam.1.20|20]] Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, \[saying\], Because I have asked him of the LORD.

20: 

[[1Sam.1.21|21]] And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.

21: 

[[1Sam.1.22|22]] But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, \[I will not go up\] until the child be weaned, and \[then\] I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.

22: 

[[1Sam.1.23|23]] And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.

23: 

[[1Sam.1.24|24]] And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child \[was\] young.

24: 

[[1Sam.1.25|25]] And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.

25: 

[[1Sam.1.26|26]] And she said, Oh my lord, \[as\] thy soul liveth, my lord, I \[am\] the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.

26: 

[[1Sam.1.27|27]] For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:

27: 

[[1Sam.1.28|28]] Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.

28:
