[[1Sam.20|1 Samuel 20:1 - 1 Samuel 20:9]]
*Jonathan Helps David*

[[1Sam.20.1|1]] And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what \[is\] mine iniquity? and what \[is\] my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?

1: 

[[1Sam.20.2|2]] And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it \[is\] not \[so\].

2: 

[[1Sam.20.3|3]] And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly \[as\] the LORD liveth, and \[as\] thy soul liveth, \[there is\] but a step between me and death.

3: 

[[1Sam.20.4|4]] Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do \[it\] for thee.

4: 

[[1Sam.20.5|5]] And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow \[is\] the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third \[day\] at even.

5: 

[[1Sam.20.6|6]] If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked \[leave\] of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for \[there is\] a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.

6: 

[[1Sam.20.7|7]] If he say thus, \[It is\] well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, \[then\] be sure that evil is determined by him.

7: 

[[1Sam.20.8|8]] Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?

8: 

[[1Sam.20.9|9]] And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?

9:
