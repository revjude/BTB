[[1Sam.20|1 Samuel 20:30 - 1 Samuel 20:42]]
*Saul Seeks to Kill Jonathan*

[[1Sam.20.30|30]] Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious \[woman\], do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother’s nakedness?

30: 

[[1Sam.20.31|31]] For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.

31: 

[[1Sam.20.32|32]] And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?

32: 

[[1Sam.20.33|33]] And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.

33: 

[[1Sam.20.34|34]] So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.

34: 

[[1Sam.20.35|35]] And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.

35: 

[[1Sam.20.36|36]] And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. \[And\] as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.

36: 

[[1Sam.20.37|37]] And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, \[Is\] not the arrow beyond thee?

37: 

[[1Sam.20.38|38]] And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.

38: 

[[1Sam.20.39|39]] But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.

39: 

[[1Sam.20.40|40]] And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry \[them\] to the city.

40: 

[[1Sam.20.41|41]] \[And\] as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of \[a place\] toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.

41: 

[[1Sam.20.42|42]] And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.

42:
