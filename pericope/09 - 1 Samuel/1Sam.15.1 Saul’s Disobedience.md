[[1Sam.15|1 Samuel 15:1 - 1 Samuel 15:9]]
*Saul’s Disobedience*

[[1Sam.15.1|1]] Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee \[to be\] king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.

1: 

[[1Sam.15.2|2]] Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember \[that\] which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid \[wait\] for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.

2: 

[[1Sam.15.3|3]] Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.

3: 

[[1Sam.15.4|4]] And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.

4: 

[[1Sam.15.5|5]] And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.

5: 

[[1Sam.15.6|6]] And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.

6: 

[[1Sam.15.7|7]] And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah \[until\] thou comest to Shur, that \[is\] over against Egypt.

7: 

[[1Sam.15.8|8]] And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.

8: 

[[1Sam.15.9|9]] But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all \[that was\] good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing \[that was\] vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.

9:
