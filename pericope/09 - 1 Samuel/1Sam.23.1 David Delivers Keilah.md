[[1Sam.23|1 Samuel 23:1 - 1 Samuel 23:6]]
*David Delivers Keilah*

[[1Sam.23.1|1]] Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.

1: 

[[1Sam.23.2|2]] Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.

2: 

[[1Sam.23.3|3]] And David’s men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?

3: 

[[1Sam.23.4|4]] Then David inquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.

4: 

[[1Sam.23.5|5]] So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.

5: 

[[1Sam.23.6|6]] And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, \[that\] he came down \[with\] an ephod in his hand.
