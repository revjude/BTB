[[1Sam.16|1 Samuel 16:1 - 1 Samuel 16:13]]
*Samuel Anoints David*

[[1Sam.16.1|1]] And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.

1: 

[[1Sam.16.2|2]] And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear \[it\], he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.

2: 

[[1Sam.16.3|3]] And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me \[him\] whom I name unto thee.

3: 

[[1Sam.16.4|4]] And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?

4: 

[[1Sam.16.5|5]] And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.

5: 

[[1Sam.16.6|6]] And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD’S anointed \[is\] before him.

6: 

[[1Sam.16.7|7]] But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for \[the LORD seeth\] not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.

7: 

[[1Sam.16.8|8]] Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.

8: 

[[1Sam.16.9|9]] Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.

9: 

[[1Sam.16.10|10]] Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.

10: 

[[1Sam.16.11|11]] And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all \[thy\] children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.

11: 

[[1Sam.16.12|12]] And he sent, and brought him in. Now he \[was\] ruddy, \[and\] withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this \[is\] he.

12: 

[[1Sam.16.13|13]] Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.

13:
