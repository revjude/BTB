[[1Sam.30|1 Samuel 30:21 - 1 Samuel 30:31]]
*The Spoils Are Divided*

[[1Sam.30.21|21]] And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that \[were\] with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.

21: 

[[1Sam.30.22|22]] Then answered all the wicked men and \[men\] of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them \[ought\] of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead \[them\] away, and depart.

22: 

[[1Sam.30.23|23]] Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.

23: 

[[1Sam.30.24|24]] For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part \[is\] that goeth down to the battle, so \[shall\] his part \[be\] that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.

24: 

[[1Sam.30.25|25]] And it was \[so\] from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.

25: 

[[1Sam.30.26|26]] And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, \[even\] to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;

26: 

[[1Sam.30.27|27]] To \[them\] which \[were\] in Bethel, and to \[them\] which \[were\] in south Ramoth, and to \[them\] which \[were\] in Jattir,

27: 

[[1Sam.30.28|28]] And to \[them\] which \[were\] in Aroer, and to \[them\] which \[were\] in Siphmoth, and to \[them\] which \[were\] in Eshtemoa,

28: 

[[1Sam.30.29|29]] And to \[them\] which \[were\] in Rachal, and to \[them\] which \[were\] in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to \[them\] which \[were\] in the cities of the Kenites,

29: 

[[1Sam.30.30|30]] And to \[them\] which \[were\] in Hormah, and to \[them\] which \[were\] in Chorashan, and to \[them\] which \[were\] in Athach,

30: 

[[1Sam.30.31|31]] And to \[them\] which \[were\] in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.

31:
