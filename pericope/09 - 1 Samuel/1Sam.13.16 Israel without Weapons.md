[[1Sam.13|1 Samuel 13:16 - 1 Samuel 13:23]]
*Israel without Weapons*

[[1Sam.13.16|16]] And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people \[that were\] present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.

16: 

[[1Sam.13.17|17]] And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way \[that leadeth to\] Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:

17: 

[[1Sam.13.18|18]] And another company turned the way \[to\] Bethhoron: and another company turned \[to\] the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.

18: 

[[1Sam.13.19|19]] Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make \[them\] swords or spears:

19: 

[[1Sam.13.20|20]] But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.

20: 

[[1Sam.13.21|21]] Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.

21: 

[[1Sam.13.22|22]] So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that \[were\] with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.

22: 

[[1Sam.13.23|23]] And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.

23:
