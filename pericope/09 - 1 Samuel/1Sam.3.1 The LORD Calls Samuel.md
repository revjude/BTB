[[1Sam.3|1 Samuel 3:1 - 1 Samuel 3:14]]
*The LORD Calls Samuel*

[[1Sam.3.1|1]] And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; \[there was\] no open vision.

1: 

[[1Sam.3.2|2]] And it came to pass at that time, when Eli \[was\] laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, \[that\] he could not see;

2: 

[[1Sam.3.3|3]] And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God \[was\], and Samuel was laid down \[to sleep\];

3: 

[[1Sam.3.4|4]] That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here \[am\] I.

4: 

[[1Sam.3.5|5]] And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here \[am\] I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.

5: 

[[1Sam.3.6|6]] And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here \[am\] I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.

6: 

[[1Sam.3.7|7]] Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.

7: 

[[1Sam.3.8|8]] And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here \[am\] I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.

8: 

[[1Sam.3.9|9]] Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.

9: 

[[1Sam.3.10|10]] And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.

10: 

[[1Sam.3.11|11]] And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.

11: 

[[1Sam.3.12|12]] In that day I will perform against Eli all \[things\] which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.

12: 

[[1Sam.3.13|13]] For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.

13: 

[[1Sam.3.14|14]] And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.

14:
