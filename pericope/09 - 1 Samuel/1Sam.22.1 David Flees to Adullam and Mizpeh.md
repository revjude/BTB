*David Flees to Adullam and Mizpeh*

[[1Sam.22.1|1]] David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father’s house heard \[it\], they went down thither to him.

1: 

[[1Sam.22.2|2]] And every one \[that was\] in distress, and every one that \[was\] in debt, and every one \[that was\] discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.

2: 

[[1Sam.22.3|3]] And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, \[and be\] with you, till I know what God will do for me.

3: 

[[1Sam.22.4|4]] And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.

4: 

[[1Sam.22.5|5]] And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.
