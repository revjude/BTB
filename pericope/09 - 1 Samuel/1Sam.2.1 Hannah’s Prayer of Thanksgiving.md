[[1Sam.2|1 Samuel 2:1 - 1 Samuel 2:11]]
*Hannah’s Prayer of Thanksgiving*

[[1Sam.2.1|1]] And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.

1: 

[[1Sam.2.2|2]] \[There is\] none holy as the LORD: for \[there is\] none beside thee: neither \[is there\] any rock like our God.

2: 

[[1Sam.2.3|3]] Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let \[not\] arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD \[is\] a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.

3: 

[[1Sam.2.4|4]] The bows of the mighty men \[are\] broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.

4: 

[[1Sam.2.5|5]] \[They that were\] full have hired out themselves for bread; and \[they that were\] hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.

5: 

[[1Sam.2.6|6]] The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.

6: 

[[1Sam.2.7|7]] The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.

7: 

[[1Sam.2.8|8]] He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, \[and\] lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set \[them\] among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth \[are\] the LORD’S, and he hath set the world upon them.

8: 

[[1Sam.2.9|9]] He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.

9: 

[[1Sam.2.10|10]] The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.

10: 

[[1Sam.2.11|11]] And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.

11:
