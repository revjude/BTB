[[1Sam.17|1 Samuel 17:38 - 1 Samuel 17:58]]
*David Slays Goliath*

[[1Sam.17.38|38]] And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.

38: 

[[1Sam.17.39|39]] And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved \[it\]. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved \[them\]. And David put them off him.

39: 

[[1Sam.17.40|40]] And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling \[was\] in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.

40: 

[[1Sam.17.41|41]] And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield \[went\] before him.

41: 

[[1Sam.17.42|42]] And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was \[but\] a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.

42: 

[[1Sam.17.43|43]] And the Philistine said unto David, \[Am\] I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.

43: 

[[1Sam.17.44|44]] And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.

44: 

[[1Sam.17.45|45]] Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.

45: 

[[1Sam.17.46|46]] This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.

46: 

[[1Sam.17.47|47]] And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle \[is\] the LORD’S, and he will give you into our hands.

47: 

[[1Sam.17.48|48]] And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.

48: 

[[1Sam.17.49|49]] And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang \[it\], and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.

49: 

[[1Sam.17.50|50]] So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but \[there was\] no sword in the hand of David.

50: 

[[1Sam.17.51|51]] Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.

51: 

[[1Sam.17.52|52]] And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.

52: 

[[1Sam.17.53|53]] And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.

53: 

[[1Sam.17.54|54]] And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.

54: 

[[1Sam.17.55|55]] And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son \[is\] this youth? And Abner said, \[As\] thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.

55: 

[[1Sam.17.56|56]] And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling \[is\].

56: 

[[1Sam.17.57|57]] And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.

57: 

[[1Sam.17.58|58]] And Saul said to him, Whose son \[art\] thou, \[thou\] young man? And David answered, \[I am\] the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.
