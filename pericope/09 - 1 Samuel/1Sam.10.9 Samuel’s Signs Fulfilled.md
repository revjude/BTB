[[1Sam.10|1 Samuel 10:9 - 1 Samuel 10:16]]
*Samuel’s Signs Fulfilled*

[[1Sam.10.9|9]] And it was \[so\], that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.

9: 

[[1Sam.10.10|10]] And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.

10: 

[[1Sam.10.11|11]] And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What \[is\] this \[that\] is come unto the son of Kish? \[Is\] Saul also among the prophets?

11: 

[[1Sam.10.12|12]] And one of the same place answered and said, But who \[is\] their father? Therefore it became a proverb, \[Is\] Saul also among the prophets?

12: 

[[1Sam.10.13|13]] And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.

13: 

[[1Sam.10.14|14]] And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that \[they were\] no where, we came to Samuel.

14: 

[[1Sam.10.15|15]] And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.

15: 

[[1Sam.10.16|16]] And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.

16:
