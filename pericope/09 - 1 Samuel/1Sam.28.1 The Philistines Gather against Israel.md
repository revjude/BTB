[[1Sam.28|1 Samuel 28:1 - 1 Samuel 28:6]]
*The Philistines Gather against Israel*

[[1Sam.28.1|1]] And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.

1: 

[[1Sam.28.2|2]] And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever.

2: 

[[1Sam.28.3|3]] Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.

3: 

[[1Sam.28.4|4]] And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa.

4: 

[[1Sam.28.5|5]] And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.

5: 

[[1Sam.28.6|6]] And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
