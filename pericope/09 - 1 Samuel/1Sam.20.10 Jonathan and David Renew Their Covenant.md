[[1Sam.20|1 Samuel 20:10 - 1 Samuel 20:29]]
*Jonathan and David Renew Their Covenant*

[[1Sam.20.10|10]] Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what \[if\] thy father answer thee roughly?

10: 

[[1Sam.20.11|11]] And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.

11: 

[[1Sam.20.12|12]] And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, \[or\] the third \[day\], and, behold, \[if there be\] good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;

12: 

[[1Sam.20.13|13]] The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father \[to do\] thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.

13: 

[[1Sam.20.14|14]] And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:

14: 

[[1Sam.20.15|15]] But \[also\] thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.

15: 

[[1Sam.20.16|16]] So Jonathan made \[a covenant\] with the house of David, \[saying\], Let the LORD even require \[it\] at the hand of David’s enemies.

16: 

[[1Sam.20.17|17]] And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.

17: 

[[1Sam.20.18|18]] Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow \[is\] the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.

18: 

[[1Sam.20.19|19]] And \[when\] thou hast stayed three days, \[then\] thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was \[in hand\], and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.

19: 

[[1Sam.20.20|20]] And I will shoot three arrows on the side \[thereof\], as though I shot at a mark.

20: 

[[1Sam.20.21|21]] And, behold, I will send a lad, \[saying\], Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows \[are\] on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for \[there is\] peace to thee, and no hurt; \[as\] the LORD liveth.

21: 

[[1Sam.20.22|22]] But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows \[are\] beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.

22: 

[[1Sam.20.23|23]] And \[as touching\] the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD \[be\] between thee and me for ever.

23: 

[[1Sam.20.24|24]] So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.

24: 

[[1Sam.20.25|25]] And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, \[even\] upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul’s side, and David’s place was empty.

25: 

[[1Sam.20.26|26]] Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he \[is\] not clean; surely he \[is\] not clean.

26: 

[[1Sam.20.27|27]] And it came to pass on the morrow, \[which was\] the second \[day\] of the month, that David’s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?

27: 

[[1Sam.20.28|28]] And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked \[leave\] of me \[to go\] to Bethlehem:

28: 

[[1Sam.20.29|29]] And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me \[to be there\]: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king’s table.

29:
