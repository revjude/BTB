[[1Sam.23|1 Samuel 23:7 - 1 Samuel 23:29]]
*Saul Pursues David*

[[1Sam.23.7|7]] And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.

7: 

[[1Sam.23.8|8]] And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.

8: 

[[1Sam.23.9|9]] And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.

9: 

[[1Sam.23.10|10]] Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.

10: 

[[1Sam.23.11|11]] Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.

11: 

[[1Sam.23.12|12]] Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver \[thee\] up.

12: 

[[1Sam.23.13|13]] Then David and his men, \[which were\] about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.

13: 

[[1Sam.23.14|14]] And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.

14: 

[[1Sam.23.15|15]] And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David \[was\] in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.

15: 

[[1Sam.23.16|16]] And Jonathan Saul’s son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.

16: 

[[1Sam.23.17|17]] And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.

17: 

[[1Sam.23.18|18]] And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.

18: 

[[1Sam.23.19|19]] Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which \[is\] on the south of Jeshimon?

19: 

[[1Sam.23.20|20]] Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part \[shall be\] to deliver him into the king’s hand.

20: 

[[1Sam.23.21|21]] And Saul said, Blessed \[be\] ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me.

21: 

[[1Sam.23.22|22]] Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, \[and\] who hath seen him there: for it is told me \[that\] he dealeth very subtilly.

22: 

[[1Sam.23.23|23]] See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.

23: 

[[1Sam.23.24|24]] And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men \[were\] in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.

24: 

[[1Sam.23.25|25]] Saul also and his men went to seek \[him\]. And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard \[that\], he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.

25: 

[[1Sam.23.26|26]] And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.

26: 

[[1Sam.23.27|27]] But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.

27: 

[[1Sam.23.28|28]] Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth.

28: 

[[1Sam.23.29|29]] And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi.
