[[1Sam.8|1 Samuel 8:10 - 1 Samuel 8:18]]
*Samuel’s Warning*

[[1Sam.8.10|10]] And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.

10: 

[[1Sam.8.11|11]] And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint \[them\] for himself, for his chariots, and \[to be\] his horsemen; and \[some\] shall run before his chariots.

11: 

[[1Sam.8.12|12]] And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and \[will set them\] to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.

12: 

[[1Sam.8.13|13]] And he will take your daughters \[to be\] confectionaries, and \[to be\] cooks, and \[to be\] bakers.

13: 

[[1Sam.8.14|14]] And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, \[even\] the best \[of them\], and give \[them\] to his servants.

14: 

[[1Sam.8.15|15]] And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.

15: 

[[1Sam.8.16|16]] And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put \[them\] to his work.

16: 

[[1Sam.8.17|17]] He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.

17: 

[[1Sam.8.18|18]] And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.

18:
