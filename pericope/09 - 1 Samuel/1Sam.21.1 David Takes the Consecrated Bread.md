[[1Sam.21|1 Samuel 21:1 - 1 Samuel 21:7]]
*David Takes the Consecrated Bread*

[[1Sam.21.1|1]] Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why \[art\] thou alone, and no man with thee?

1: 

[[1Sam.21.2|2]] And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed \[my\] servants to such and such a place.

2: 

[[1Sam.21.3|3]] Now therefore what is under thine hand? give \[me\] five \[loaves of\] bread in mine hand, or what there is present.

3: 

[[1Sam.21.4|4]] And the priest answered David, and said, \[There is\] no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.

4: 

[[1Sam.21.5|5]] And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women \[have been\] kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and \[the bread is\] in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.

5: 

[[1Sam.21.6|6]] So the priest gave him hallowed \[bread\]: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.

6: 

[[1Sam.21.7|7]] Now a certain man of the servants of Saul \[was\] there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name \[was\] Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that \[belonged\] to Saul.

7:
