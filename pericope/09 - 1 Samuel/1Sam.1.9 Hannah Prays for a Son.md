[[1Sam.1|1 Samuel 1:9 - 1 Samuel 1:18]]
*Hannah Prays for a Son*

[[1Sam.1.9|9]] So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.

9: 

[[1Sam.1.10|10]] And she \[was\] in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.

10: 

[[1Sam.1.11|11]] And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no rasor come upon his head.

11: 

[[1Sam.1.12|12]] And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.

12: 

[[1Sam.1.13|13]] Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.

13: 

[[1Sam.1.14|14]] And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.

14: 

[[1Sam.1.15|15]] And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I \[am\] a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.

15: 

[[1Sam.1.16|16]] Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.

16: 

[[1Sam.1.17|17]] Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant \[thee\] thy petition that thou hast asked of him.

17: 

[[1Sam.1.18|18]] And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more \[sad\].

18:
