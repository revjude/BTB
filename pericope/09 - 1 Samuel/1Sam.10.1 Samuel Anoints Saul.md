[[1Sam.10|1 Samuel 10:1 - 1 Samuel 10:8]]
*Samuel Anoints Saul*

[[1Sam.10.1|1]] Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured \[it\] upon his head, and kissed him, and said, \[Is it\] not because the LORD hath anointed thee \[to be\] captain over his inheritance?

1: 

[[1Sam.10.2|2]] When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel’s sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?

2: 

[[1Sam.10.3|3]] Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:

3: 

[[1Sam.10.4|4]] And they will salute thee, and give thee two \[loaves\] of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.

4: 

[[1Sam.10.5|5]] After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where \[is\] the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:

5: 

[[1Sam.10.6|6]] And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.

6: 

[[1Sam.10.7|7]] And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, \[that\] thou do as occasion serve thee; for God \[is\] with thee.

7: 

[[1Sam.10.8|8]] And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, \[and\] to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.

8:
