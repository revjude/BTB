[[1Sam.14|1 Samuel 14:24 - 1 Samuel 14:36]]
*Jonathan Eats the Honey*

[[1Sam.14.24|24]] And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed \[be\] the man that eateth \[any\] food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted \[any\] food.

24: 

[[1Sam.14.25|25]] And all \[they of\] the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.

25: 

[[1Sam.14.26|26]] And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.

26: 

[[1Sam.14.27|27]] But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that \[was\] in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.

27: 

[[1Sam.14.28|28]] Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed \[be\] the man that eateth \[any\] food this day. And the people were faint.

28: 

[[1Sam.14.29|29]] Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.

29: 

[[1Sam.14.30|30]] How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?

30: 

[[1Sam.14.31|31]] And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.

31: 

[[1Sam.14.32|32]] And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew \[them\] on the ground: and the people did eat \[them\] with the blood.

32: 

[[1Sam.14.33|33]] Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.

33: 

[[1Sam.14.34|34]] And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay \[them\] here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew \[them\] there.

34: 

[[1Sam.14.35|35]] And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.

35: 

[[1Sam.14.36|36]] And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.
