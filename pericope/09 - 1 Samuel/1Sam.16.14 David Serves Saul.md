[[1Sam.16|1 Samuel 16:14 - 1 Samuel 16:23]]
*David Serves Saul*

[[1Sam.16.14|14]] But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.

14: 

[[1Sam.16.15|15]] And Saul’s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.

15: 

[[1Sam.16.16|16]] Let our lord now command thy servants, \[which are\] before thee, to seek out a man, \[who is\] a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.

16: 

[[1Sam.16.17|17]] And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring \[him\] to me.

17: 

[[1Sam.16.18|18]] Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, \[that is\] cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD \[is\] with him.

18: 

[[1Sam.16.19|19]] Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which \[is\] with the sheep.

19: 

[[1Sam.16.20|20]] And Jesse took an ass \[laden\] with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent \[them\] by David his son unto Saul.

20: 

[[1Sam.16.21|21]] And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.

21: 

[[1Sam.16.22|22]] And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.

22: 

[[1Sam.16.23|23]] And it came to pass, when the \[evil\] spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.

23:
