[[1Sam.26|1 Samuel 26:13 - 1 Samuel 26:20]]
*David Reproves Abner*

[[1Sam.26.13|13]] Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space \[being\] between them:

13: 

[[1Sam.26.14|14]] And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who \[art\] thou \[that\] criest to the king?

14: 

[[1Sam.26.15|15]] And David said to Abner, \[Art\] not thou a \[valiant\] man? and who \[is\] like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.

15: 

[[1Sam.26.16|16]] This thing \[is\] not good that thou hast done. \[As\] the LORD liveth, ye \[are\] worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD’S anointed. And now see where the king’s spear \[is\], and the cruse of water that \[was\] at his bolster.

16: 

[[1Sam.26.17|17]] And Saul knew David’s voice, and said, \[Is\] this thy voice, my son David? And David said, \[It is\] my voice, my lord, O king.

17: 

[[1Sam.26.18|18]] And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil \[is\] in mine hand?

18: 

[[1Sam.26.19|19]] Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if \[they be\] the children of men, cursed \[be\] they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.

19: 

[[1Sam.26.20|20]] Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.

20:
