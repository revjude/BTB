[[1Sam.26|1 Samuel 26:1 - 1 Samuel 26:12]]
*David Again Spares Saul*

[[1Sam.26.1|1]] And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, \[which is\] before Jeshimon?

1: 

[[1Sam.26.2|2]] Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.

2: 

[[1Sam.26.3|3]] And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which \[is\] before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.

3: 

[[1Sam.26.4|4]] David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.

4: 

[[1Sam.26.5|5]] And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.

5: 

[[1Sam.26.6|6]] Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.

6: 

[[1Sam.26.7|7]] So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.

7: 

[[1Sam.26.8|8]] Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not \[smite\] him the second time.

8: 

[[1Sam.26.9|9]] And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD’S anointed, and be guiltless?

9: 

[[1Sam.26.10|10]] David said furthermore, \[As\] the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.

10: 

[[1Sam.26.11|11]] The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD’S anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that \[is\] at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.

11: 

[[1Sam.26.12|12]] So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw \[it\], nor knew \[it\], neither awaked: for they \[were\] all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.

12:
