[[1Sam.13|1 Samuel 13:1 - 1 Samuel 13:7]]
*War with the Philistines*

[[1Sam.13.1|1]] Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,

1: 

[[1Sam.13.2|2]] Saul chose him three thousand \[men\] of Israel; \[whereof\] two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.

2: 

[[1Sam.13.3|3]] And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that \[was\] in Geba, and the Philistines heard \[of it\]. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.

3: 

[[1Sam.13.4|4]] And all Israel heard say \[that\] Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and \[that\] Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.

4: 

[[1Sam.13.5|5]] And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which \[is\] on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.

5: 

[[1Sam.13.6|6]] When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.

6: 

[[1Sam.13.7|7]] And \[some of\] the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he \[was\] yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.

7:
