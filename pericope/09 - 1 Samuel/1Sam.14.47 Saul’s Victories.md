[[1Sam.14|1 Samuel 14:47 - 1 Samuel 14:52]]
*Saul’s Victories*

[[1Sam.14.47|47]] So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed \[them\].

47: 

[[1Sam.14.48|48]] And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.

48: 

[[1Sam.14.49|49]] Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters \[were these\]; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:

49: 

[[1Sam.14.50|50]] And the name of Saul’s wife \[was\] Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host \[was\] Abner, the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.

50: 

[[1Sam.14.51|51]] And Kish \[was\] the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner \[was\] the son of Abiel.

51: 

[[1Sam.14.52|52]] And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.

52:
