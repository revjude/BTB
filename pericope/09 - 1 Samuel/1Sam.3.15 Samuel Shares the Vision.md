[[1Sam.3|1 Samuel 3:15 - 1 Samuel 3:21]]
*Samuel Shares the Vision*

[[1Sam.3.15|15]] And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.

15: 

[[1Sam.3.16|16]] Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here \[am\] I.

16: 

[[1Sam.3.17|17]] And he said, What \[is\] the thing that \[the LORD\] hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide \[it\] not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide \[any\] thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.

17: 

[[1Sam.3.18|18]] And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It \[is\] the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.

18: 

[[1Sam.3.19|19]] And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.

19: 

[[1Sam.3.20|20]] And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel \[was\] established \[to be\] a prophet of the LORD.

20: 

[[1Sam.3.21|21]] And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.

21:
