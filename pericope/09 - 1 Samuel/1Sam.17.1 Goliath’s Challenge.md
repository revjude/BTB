[[1Sam.17|1 Samuel 17:1 - 1 Samuel 17:11]]
*Goliath’s Challenge*

[[1Sam.17.1|1]] Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which \[belongeth\] to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.

1: 

[[1Sam.17.2|2]] And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.

2: 

[[1Sam.17.3|3]] And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and \[there was\] a valley between them.

3: 

[[1Sam.17.4|4]] And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height \[was\] six cubits and a span.

4: 

[[1Sam.17.5|5]] And \[he had\] an helmet of brass upon his head, and he \[was\] armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat \[was\] five thousand shekels of brass.

5: 

[[1Sam.17.6|6]] And \[he had\] greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.

6: 

[[1Sam.17.7|7]] And the staff of his spear \[was\] like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head \[weighed\] six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.

7: 

[[1Sam.17.8|8]] And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set \[your\] battle in array? \[am\] not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.

8: 

[[1Sam.17.9|9]] If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.

9: 

[[1Sam.17.10|10]] And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.

10: 

[[1Sam.17.11|11]] When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.

11:
