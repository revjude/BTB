[[1Sam.9|1 Samuel 9:1 - 1 Samuel 9:27]]
*Saul Chosen as King*

[[1Sam.9.1|1]] Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name \[was\] Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.

1: 

[[1Sam.9.2|2]] And he had a son, whose name \[was\] Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and \[there was\] not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward \[he was\] higher than any of the people.

2: 

[[1Sam.9.3|3]] And the asses of Kish Saul’s father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.

3: 

[[1Sam.9.4|4]] And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found \[them\] not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and \[there they were\] not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found \[them\] not.

4: 

[[1Sam.9.5|5]] \[And\] when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that \[was\] with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave \[caring\] for the asses, and take thought for us.

5: 

[[1Sam.9.6|6]] And he said unto him, Behold now, \[there is\] in this city a man of God, and \[he is\] an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.

6: 

[[1Sam.9.7|7]] Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, \[if\] we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and \[there is\] not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?

7: 

[[1Sam.9.8|8]] And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: \[that\] will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.

8: 

[[1Sam.9.9|9]] (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for \[he that is\] now \[called\] a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)

9: 

[[1Sam.9.10|10]] Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God \[was\].

10: 

[[1Sam.9.11|11]] \[And\] as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?

11: 

[[1Sam.9.12|12]] And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, \[he is\] before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for \[there is\] a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:

12: 

[[1Sam.9.13|13]] As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; \[and\] afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.

13: 

[[1Sam.9.14|14]] And they went up into the city: \[and\] when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.

14: 

[[1Sam.9.15|15]] Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,

15: 

[[1Sam.9.16|16]] To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him \[to be\] captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.

16: 

[[1Sam.9.17|17]] And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.

17: 

[[1Sam.9.18|18]] Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer’s house \[is\].

18: 

[[1Sam.9.19|19]] And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I \[am\] the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that \[is\] in thine heart.

19: 

[[1Sam.9.20|20]] And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom \[is\] all the desire of Israel? \[Is it\] not on thee, and on all thy father’s house?

20: 

[[1Sam.9.21|21]] And Saul answered and said, \[Am\] not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?

21: 

[[1Sam.9.22|22]] And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which \[were\] about thirty persons.

22: 

[[1Sam.9.23|23]] And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.

23: 

[[1Sam.9.24|24]] And the cook took up the shoulder, and \[that\] which \[was\] upon it, and set \[it\] before Saul. And \[Samuel\] said, Behold that which is left! set \[it\] before thee, \[and\] eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.

24: 

[[1Sam.9.25|25]] And when they were come down from the high place into the city, \[Samuel\] communed with Saul upon the top of the house.

25: 

[[1Sam.9.26|26]] And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.

26: 

[[1Sam.9.27|27]] \[And\] as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.

27:
