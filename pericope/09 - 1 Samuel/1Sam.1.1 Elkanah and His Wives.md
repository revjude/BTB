[[1Sam.1|1 Samuel 1:1 - 1 Samuel 1:8]]
*Elkanah and His Wives*

[[1Sam.1.1|1]] Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name \[was\] Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:

1: 

[[1Sam.1.2|2]] And he had two wives; the name of the one \[was\] Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.

2: 

[[1Sam.1.3|3]] And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, \[were\] there.

3: 

[[1Sam.1.4|4]] And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:

4: 

[[1Sam.1.5|5]] But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.

5: 

[[1Sam.1.6|6]] And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.

6: 

[[1Sam.1.7|7]] And \[as\] he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.

7: 

[[1Sam.1.8|8]] Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? \[am\] not I better to thee than ten sons?

8:
