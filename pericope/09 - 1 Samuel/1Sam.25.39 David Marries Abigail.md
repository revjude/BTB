[[1Sam.25|1 Samuel 25:39 - 1 Samuel 25:44]]
*David Marries Abigail*

[[1Sam.25.39|39]] And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed \[be\] the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.

39: 

[[1Sam.25.40|40]] And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.

40: 

[[1Sam.25.41|41]] And she arose, and bowed herself on \[her\] face to the earth, and said, Behold, \[let\] thine handmaid \[be\] a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.

41: 

[[1Sam.25.42|42]] And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.

42: 

[[1Sam.25.43|43]] David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.

43: 

[[1Sam.25.44|44]] But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which \[was\] of Gallim.

44:
