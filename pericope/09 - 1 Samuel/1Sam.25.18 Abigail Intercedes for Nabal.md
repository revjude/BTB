[[1Sam.25|1 Samuel 25:18 - 1 Samuel 25:38]]
*Abigail Intercedes for Nabal*

[[1Sam.25.18|18]] Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched \[corn\], and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid \[them\] on asses.

18: 

[[1Sam.25.19|19]] And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.

19: 

[[1Sam.25.20|20]] And it was \[so, as\] she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.

20: 

[[1Sam.25.21|21]] Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this \[fellow\] hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that \[pertained\] unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.

21: 

[[1Sam.25.22|22]] So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that \[pertain\] to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.

22: 

[[1Sam.25.23|23]] And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,

23: 

[[1Sam.25.24|24]] And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, \[upon\] me \[let this\] iniquity \[be\]: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.

24: 

[[1Sam.25.25|25]] Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, \[even\] Nabal: for as his name \[is\], so \[is\] he; Nabal \[is\] his name, and folly \[is\] with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.

25: 

[[1Sam.25.26|26]] Now therefore, my lord, \[as\] the LORD liveth, and \[as\] thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to \[shed\] blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.

26: 

[[1Sam.25.27|27]] And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.

27: 

[[1Sam.25.28|28]] I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee \[all\] thy days.

28: 

[[1Sam.25.29|29]] Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, \[as out\] of the middle of a sling.

29: 

[[1Sam.25.30|30]] And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;

30: 

[[1Sam.25.31|31]] That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.

31: 

[[1Sam.25.32|32]] And David said to Abigail, Blessed \[be\] the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:

32: 

[[1Sam.25.33|33]] And blessed \[be\] thy advice, and blessed \[be\] thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to \[shed\] blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.

33: 

[[1Sam.25.34|34]] For in very deed, \[as\] the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.

34: 

[[1Sam.25.35|35]] So David received of her hand \[that\] which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.

35: 

[[1Sam.25.36|36]] And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal’s heart \[was\] merry within him, for he \[was\] very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.

36: 

[[1Sam.25.37|37]] But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became \[as\] a stone.

37: 

[[1Sam.25.38|38]] And it came to pass about ten days \[after\], that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.

38:
