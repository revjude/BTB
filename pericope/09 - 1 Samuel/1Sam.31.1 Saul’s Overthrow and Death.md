[[1Sam.31|1 Samuel 31:1 - 1 Samuel 31:6]]
*Saul’s Overthrow and Death*

[[1Sam.31.1|1]] Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.

1: 

[[1Sam.31.2|2]] And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul’s sons.

2: 

[[1Sam.31.3|3]] And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.

3: 

[[1Sam.31.4|4]] Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.

4: 

[[1Sam.31.5|5]] And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.

5: 

[[1Sam.31.6|6]] So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.

6:
