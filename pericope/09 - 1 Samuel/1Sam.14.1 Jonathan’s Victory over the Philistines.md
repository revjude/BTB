[[1Sam.14|1 Samuel 14:1 - 1 Samuel 14:23]]
*Jonathan’s Victory over the Philistines*

[[1Sam.14.1|1]] Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison, that \[is\] on the other side. But he told not his father.

1: 

[[1Sam.14.2|2]] And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which \[is\] in Migron: and the people that \[were\] with him \[were\] about six hundred men;

2: 

[[1Sam.14.3|3]] And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD’S priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.

3: 

[[1Sam.14.4|4]] And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines’ garrison, \[there was\] a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one \[was\] Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.

4: 

[[1Sam.14.5|5]] The forefront of the one \[was\] situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.

5: 

[[1Sam.14.6|6]] And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for \[there is\] no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.

6: 

[[1Sam.14.7|7]] And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that \[is\] in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I \[am\] with thee according to thy heart.

7: 

[[1Sam.14.8|8]] Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto \[these\] men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.

8: 

[[1Sam.14.9|9]] If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.

9: 

[[1Sam.14.10|10]] But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this \[shall be\] a sign unto us.

10: 

[[1Sam.14.11|11]] And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.

11: 

[[1Sam.14.12|12]] And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.

12: 

[[1Sam.14.13|13]] And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.

13: 

[[1Sam.14.14|14]] And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, \[which\] a yoke \[of oxen might plow\].

14: 

[[1Sam.14.15|15]] And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.

15: 

[[1Sam.14.16|16]] And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down \[one another\].

16: 

[[1Sam.14.17|17]] Then said Saul unto the people that \[were\] with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer \[were\] not \[there\].

17: 

[[1Sam.14.18|18]] And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.

18: 

[[1Sam.14.19|19]] And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that \[was\] in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.

19: 

[[1Sam.14.20|20]] And Saul and all the people that \[were\] with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow, \[and there was\] a very great discomfiture.

20: 

[[1Sam.14.21|21]] Moreover the Hebrews \[that\] were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp \[from the country\] round about, even they also \[turned\] to be with the Israelites that \[were\] with Saul and Jonathan.

21: 

[[1Sam.14.22|22]] Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, \[when\] they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.

22: 

[[1Sam.14.23|23]] So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.

23:
