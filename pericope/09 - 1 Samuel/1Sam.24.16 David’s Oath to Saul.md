[[1Sam.24|1 Samuel 24:16 - 1 Samuel 24:22]]
*David’s Oath to Saul*

[[1Sam.24.16|16]] And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, \[Is\] this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.

16: 

[[1Sam.24.17|17]] And he said to David, Thou \[art\] more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.

17: 

[[1Sam.24.18|18]] And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.

18: 

[[1Sam.24.19|19]] For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.

19: 

[[1Sam.24.20|20]] And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.

20: 

[[1Sam.24.21|21]] Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father’s house.

21: 

[[1Sam.24.22|22]] And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.

22:
