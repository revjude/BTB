[[1Sam.28|1 Samuel 28:7 - 1 Samuel 28:25]]
*Saul and the Medium of Endor*

[[1Sam.28.7|7]] Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, \[there is\] a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.

7: 

[[1Sam.28.8|8]] And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me \[him\] up, whom I shall name unto thee.

8: 

[[1Sam.28.9|9]] And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?

9: 

[[1Sam.28.10|10]] And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, \[As\] the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.

10: 

[[1Sam.28.11|11]] Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.

11: 

[[1Sam.28.12|12]] And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou \[art\] Saul.

12: 

[[1Sam.28.13|13]] And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.

13: 

[[1Sam.28.14|14]] And he said unto her, What form \[is\] he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he \[is\] covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it \[was\] Samuel, and he stooped with \[his\] face to the ground, and bowed himself.

14: 

[[1Sam.28.15|15]] And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.

15: 

[[1Sam.28.16|16]] Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?

16: 

[[1Sam.28.17|17]] And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, \[even\] to David:

17: 

[[1Sam.28.18|18]] Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day.

18: 

[[1Sam.28.19|19]] Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow \[shalt\] thou and thy sons \[be\] with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.

19: 

[[1Sam.28.20|20]] Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.

20: 

[[1Sam.28.21|21]] And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.

21: 

[[1Sam.28.22|22]] Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.

22: 

[[1Sam.28.23|23]] But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.

23: 

[[1Sam.28.24|24]] And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded \[it\], and did bake unleavened bread thereof:

24: 

[[1Sam.28.25|25]] And she brought \[it\] before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.
