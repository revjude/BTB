[[1Sam.30|1 Samuel 30:7 - 1 Samuel 30:20]]
*David Destroys the Amalekites*

[[1Sam.30.7|7]] And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech’s son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.

7: 

[[1Sam.30.8|8]] And David inquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake \[them\], and without fail recover \[all\].

8: 

[[1Sam.30.9|9]] So David went, he and the six hundred men that \[were\] with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.

9: 

[[1Sam.30.10|10]] But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.

10: 

[[1Sam.30.11|11]] And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;

11: 

[[1Sam.30.12|12]] And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk \[any\] water, three days and three nights.

12: 

[[1Sam.30.13|13]] And David said unto him, To whom \[belongest\] thou? and whence \[art\] thou? And he said, I \[am\] a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick.

13: 

[[1Sam.30.14|14]] We made an invasion \[upon\] the south of the Cherethites, and upon \[the coast\] which \[belongeth\] to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.

14: 

[[1Sam.30.15|15]] And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company.

15: 

[[1Sam.30.16|16]] And when he had brought him down, behold, \[they were\] spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.

16: 

[[1Sam.30.17|17]] And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.

17: 

[[1Sam.30.18|18]] And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.

18: 

[[1Sam.30.19|19]] And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any \[thing\] that they had taken to them: David recovered all.

19: 

[[1Sam.30.20|20]] And David took all the flocks and the herds, \[which\] they drave before those \[other\] cattle, and said, This \[is\] David’s spoil.
