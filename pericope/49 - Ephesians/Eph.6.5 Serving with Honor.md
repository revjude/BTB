[[Eph.6|Ephesians 6:5 - Ephesians 6:9]]
*Serving with Honor*

[[Eph.6.5|5]] Servants, be obedient to them that are \[your\] masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;

5: 

[[Eph.6.6|6]] Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;

6: 

[[Eph.6.7|7]] With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:

7: 

[[Eph.6.8|8]] Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether \[he be\] bond or free.

8: 

[[Eph.6.9|9]] And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.

9:
