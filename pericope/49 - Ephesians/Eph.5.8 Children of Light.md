[[Eph.5|Ephesians 5:8 - Ephesians 5:20]]
*Children of Light*

[[Eph.5.8|8]] For ye were sometimes darkness, but now \[are ye\] light in the Lord: walk as children of light:

8: 

[[Eph.5.9|9]] (For the fruit of the Spirit \[is\] in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)

9: 

[[Eph.5.10|10]] Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

10: 

[[Eph.5.11|11]] And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove \[them\].

11: 

[[Eph.5.12|12]] For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.

12: 

[[Eph.5.13|13]] But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.

13: 

[[Eph.5.14|14]] Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.

14: 

[[Eph.5.15|15]] See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,

15: 

[[Eph.5.16|16]] Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

16: 

[[Eph.5.17|17]] Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord \[is\].

17: 

[[Eph.5.18|18]] And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;

18: 

[[Eph.5.19|19]] Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;

19: 

[[Eph.5.20|20]] Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;

20:
