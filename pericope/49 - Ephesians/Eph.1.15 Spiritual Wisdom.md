[[Eph.1|Ephesians 1:15 - Ephesians 1:23]]
*Spiritual Wisdom*

[[Eph.1.15|15]] Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,

15: 

[[Eph.1.16|16]] Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;

16: 

[[Eph.1.17|17]] That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:

17: 

[[Eph.1.18|18]] The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,

18: 

[[Eph.1.19|19]] And what \[is\] the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,

19: 

[[Eph.1.20|20]] Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set \[him\] at his own right hand in the heavenly \[places\],

20: 

[[Eph.1.21|21]] Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:

21: 

[[Eph.1.22|22]] And hath put all \[things\] under his feet, and gave him \[to be\] the head over all \[things\] to the church,

22: 

[[Eph.1.23|23]] Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.

23:
