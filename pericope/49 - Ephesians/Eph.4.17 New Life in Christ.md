[[Eph.4|Ephesians 4:17 - Ephesians 4:32]]
*New Life in Christ*

[[Eph.4.17|17]] This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,

17: 

[[Eph.4.18|18]] Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:

18: 

[[Eph.4.19|19]] Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.

19: 

[[Eph.4.20|20]] But ye have not so learned Christ;

20: 

[[Eph.4.21|21]] If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:

21: 

[[Eph.4.22|22]] That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;

22: 

[[Eph.4.23|23]] And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;

23: 

[[Eph.4.24|24]] And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.

24: 

[[Eph.4.25|25]] Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.

25: 

[[Eph.4.26|26]] Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:

26: 

[[Eph.4.27|27]] Neither give place to the devil.

27: 

[[Eph.4.28|28]] Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with \[his\] hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.

28: 

[[Eph.4.29|29]] Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.

29: 

[[Eph.4.30|30]] And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.

30: 

[[Eph.4.31|31]] Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:

31: 

[[Eph.4.32|32]] And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.

32:
