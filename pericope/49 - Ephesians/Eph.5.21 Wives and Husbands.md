[[Eph.5|Ephesians 5:21 - Ephesians 5:33]]
*Wives and Husbands*

[[Eph.5.21|21]] Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.

21: 

[[Eph.5.22|22]] Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.

22: 

[[Eph.5.23|23]] For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.

23: 

[[Eph.5.24|24]] Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so \[let\] the wives \[be\] to their own husbands in every thing.

24: 

[[Eph.5.25|25]] Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;

25: 

[[Eph.5.26|26]] That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,

26: 

[[Eph.5.27|27]] That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.

27: 

[[Eph.5.28|28]] So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.

28: 

[[Eph.5.29|29]] For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:

29: 

[[Eph.5.30|30]] For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.

30: 

[[Eph.5.31|31]] For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.

31: 

[[Eph.5.32|32]] This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.

32: 

[[Eph.5.33|33]] Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife \[see\] that she reverence \[her\] husband.

33:
