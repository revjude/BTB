[[Eph.3|Ephesians 3:14 - Ephesians 3:21]]
*Paul’s Prayer for the Ephesians*

[[Eph.3.14|14]] For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

14: 

[[Eph.3.15|15]] Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,

15: 

[[Eph.3.16|16]] That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;

16: 

[[Eph.3.17|17]] That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,

17: 

[[Eph.3.18|18]] May be able to comprehend with all saints what \[is\] the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;

18: 

[[Eph.3.19|19]] And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.

19: 

[[Eph.3.20|20]] Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,

20: 

[[Eph.3.21|21]] Unto him \[be\] glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.

21:
