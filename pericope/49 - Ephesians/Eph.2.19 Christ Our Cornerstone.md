[[Eph.2|Ephesians 2:19 - Ephesians 2:22]]
*Christ Our Cornerstone*

[[Eph.2.19|19]] Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;

19: 

[[Eph.2.20|20]] And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner \[stone\];

20: 

[[Eph.2.21|21]] In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:

21: 

[[Eph.2.22|22]] In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.

22:
