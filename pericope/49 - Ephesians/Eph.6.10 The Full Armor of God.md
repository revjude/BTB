[[Eph.6|Ephesians 6:10 - Ephesians 6:20]]
*The Full Armor of God*

[[Eph.6.10|10]] Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.

10: 

[[Eph.6.11|11]] Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.

11: 

[[Eph.6.12|12]] For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high \[places\].

12: 

[[Eph.6.13|13]] Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.

13: 

[[Eph.6.14|14]] Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;

14: 

[[Eph.6.15|15]] And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;

15: 

[[Eph.6.16|16]] Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.

16: 

[[Eph.6.17|17]] And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:

17: 

[[Eph.6.18|18]] Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;

18: 

[[Eph.6.19|19]] And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,

19: 

[[Eph.6.20|20]] For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.

20:
