[[Eph.3|Ephesians 3:1 - Ephesians 3:13]]
*The Mystery of the Gospel*

[[Eph.3.1|1]] For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,

1: 

[[Eph.3.2|2]] If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:

2: 

[[Eph.3.3|3]] How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,

3: 

[[Eph.3.4|4]] Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)

4: 

[[Eph.3.5|5]] Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;

5: 

[[Eph.3.6|6]] That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:

6: 

[[Eph.3.7|7]] Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.

7: 

[[Eph.3.8|8]] Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;

8: 

[[Eph.3.9|9]] And to make all \[men\] see what \[is\] the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:

9: 

[[Eph.3.10|10]] To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly \[places\] might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,

10: 

[[Eph.3.11|11]] According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:

11: 

[[Eph.3.12|12]] In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.

12: 

[[Eph.3.13|13]] Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.

13:
