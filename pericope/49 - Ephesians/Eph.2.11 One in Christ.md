[[Eph.2|Ephesians 2:11 - Ephesians 2:18]]
*One in Christ*

[[Eph.2.11|11]] Wherefore remember, that ye \[being\] in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;

11: 

[[Eph.2.12|12]] That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:

12: 

[[Eph.2.13|13]] But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.

13: 

[[Eph.2.14|14]] For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition \[between us\];

14: 

[[Eph.2.15|15]] Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, \[even\] the law of commandments \[contained\] in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, \[so\] making peace;

15: 

[[Eph.2.16|16]] And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:

16: 

[[Eph.2.17|17]] And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.

17: 

[[Eph.2.18|18]] For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.

18:
