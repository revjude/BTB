[[Eph.5|Ephesians 5:1 - Ephesians 5:7]]
*Imitators of God*

[[Eph.5.1|1]] Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;

1: 

[[Eph.5.2|2]] And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.

2: 

[[Eph.5.3|3]] But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;

3: 

[[Eph.5.4|4]] Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.

4: 

[[Eph.5.5|5]] For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.

5: 

[[Eph.5.6|6]] Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.

6: 

[[Eph.5.7|7]] Be not ye therefore partakers with them.

7:
