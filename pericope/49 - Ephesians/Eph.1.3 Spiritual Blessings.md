[[Eph.1|Ephesians 1:3 - Ephesians 1:14]]
*Spiritual Blessings*

[[Eph.1.3|3]] Blessed \[be\] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly \[places\] in Christ:

3: 

[[Eph.1.4|4]] According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:

4: 

[[Eph.1.5|5]] Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,

5: 

[[Eph.1.6|6]] To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.

6: 

[[Eph.1.7|7]] In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;

7: 

[[Eph.1.8|8]] Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;

8: 

[[Eph.1.9|9]] Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:

9: 

[[Eph.1.10|10]] That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; \[even\] in him:

10: 

[[Eph.1.11|11]] In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:

11: 

[[Eph.1.12|12]] That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.

12: 

[[Eph.1.13|13]] In whom ye also \[trusted\], after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,

13: 

[[Eph.1.14|14]] Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.

14:
