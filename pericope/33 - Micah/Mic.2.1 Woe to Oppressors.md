[[Mic.2|Micah 2:1 - Micah 2:5]]
*Woe to Oppressors*

[[Mic.2.1|1]] Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.

1: 

[[Mic.2.2|2]] And they covet fields, and take \[them\] by violence; and houses, and take \[them\] away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.

2: 

[[Mic.2.3|3]] Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time \[is\] evil.

3: 

[[Mic.2.4|4]] In that day shall \[one\] take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, \[and\] say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed \[it\] from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.

4: 

[[Mic.2.5|5]] Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.

5:
