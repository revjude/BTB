[[Mic.3|Micah 3:1 - Micah 3:12]]
*Rulers and Prophets Condemned*

[[Mic.3.1|1]] And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; \[Is it\] not for you to know judgment?

1: 

[[Mic.3.2|2]] Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;

2: 

[[Mic.3.3|3]] Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.

3: 

[[Mic.3.4|4]] Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.

4: 

[[Mic.3.5|5]] Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.

5: 

[[Mic.3.6|6]] Therefore night \[shall be\] unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.

6: 

[[Mic.3.7|7]] Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for \[there is\] no answer of God.

7: 

[[Mic.3.8|8]] But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.

8: 

[[Mic.3.9|9]] Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.

9: 

[[Mic.3.10|10]] They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.

10: 

[[Mic.3.11|11]] The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, \[Is\] not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us.

11: 

[[Mic.3.12|12]] Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed \[as\] a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.

12:
