[[Mic.4|Micah 4:1 - Micah 4:5]]
*The Mountain of the House of the LORD*

[[Mic.4.1|1]] But in the last days it shall come to pass, \[that\] the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it.

1: 

[[Mic.4.2|2]] And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.

2: 

[[Mic.4.3|3]] And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.

3: 

[[Mic.4.4|4]] But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make \[them\] afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken \[it\].

4: 

[[Mic.4.5|5]] For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.

5:
