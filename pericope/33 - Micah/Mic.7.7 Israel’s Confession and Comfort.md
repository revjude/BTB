[[Mic.7|Micah 7:7 - Micah 7:13]]
*Israel’s Confession and Comfort*

[[Mic.7.7|7]] Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.

7: 

[[Mic.7.8|8]] Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD \[shall be\] a light unto me.

8: 

[[Mic.7.9|9]] I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, \[and\] I shall behold his righteousness.

9: 

[[Mic.7.10|10]] Then \[she that is\] mine enemy shall see \[it\], and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.

10: 

[[Mic.7.11|11]] \[In\] the day that thy walls are to be built, \[in\] that day shall the decree be far removed.

11: 

[[Mic.7.12|12]] \[In\] that day \[also\] he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and \[from\] the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and \[from\] mountain to mountain.

12: 

[[Mic.7.13|13]] Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.

13:
