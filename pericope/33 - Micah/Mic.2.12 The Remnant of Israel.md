[[Mic.2|Micah 2:12 - Micah 2:13]]
*The Remnant of Israel*

[[Mic.2.12|12]] I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of \[the multitude of\] men.

12: 

[[Mic.2.13|13]] The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.

13:
