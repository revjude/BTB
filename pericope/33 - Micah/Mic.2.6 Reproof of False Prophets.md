[[Mic.2|Micah 2:6 - Micah 2:11]]
*Reproof of False Prophets*

[[Mic.2.6|6]] Prophesy ye not, \[say they to them that\] prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, \[that\] they shall not take shame.

6: 

[[Mic.2.7|7]] O \[thou that art\] named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? \[are\] these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?

7: 

[[Mic.2.8|8]] Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.

8: 

[[Mic.2.9|9]] The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.

9: 

[[Mic.2.10|10]] Arise ye, and depart; for this \[is\] not \[your\] rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy \[you\], even with a sore destruction.

10: 

[[Mic.2.11|11]] If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, \[saying\], I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.

11:
