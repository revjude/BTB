[[Mic.5|Micah 5:1 - Micah 5:6]]
*A Ruler from Bethlehem*

[[Mic.5.1|1]] Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.

1: 

[[Mic.5.2|2]] But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, \[though\] thou be little among the thousands of Judah, \[yet\] out of thee shall he come forth unto me \[that is\] to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth \[have been\] from of old, from everlasting.

2: 

[[Mic.5.3|3]] Therefore will he give them up, until the time \[that\] she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.

3: 

[[Mic.5.4|4]] And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.

4: 

[[Mic.5.5|5]] And this \[man\] shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.

5: 

[[Mic.5.6|6]] And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver \[us\] from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.

6:
