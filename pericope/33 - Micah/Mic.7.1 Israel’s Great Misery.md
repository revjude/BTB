[[Mic.7|Micah 7:1 - Micah 7:6]]
*Israel’s Great Misery*

[[Mic.7.1|1]] Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: \[there is\] no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.

1: 

[[Mic.7.2|2]] The good \[man\] is perished out of the earth: and \[there is\] none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.

2: 

[[Mic.7.3|3]] That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge \[asketh\] for a reward; and the great \[man\], he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.

3: 

[[Mic.7.4|4]] The best of them \[is\] as a brier: the most upright \[is sharper\] than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen \[and\] thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.

4: 

[[Mic.7.5|5]] Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.

5: 

[[Mic.7.6|6]] For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man’s enemies \[are\] the men of his own house.

6:
