[[Mic.1|Micah 1:1 - Micah 1:7]]
*Judgment to Come*

[[Mic.1.1|1]] The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, \[and\] Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.

1: 

[[Mic.1.2|2]] Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.

2: 

[[Mic.1.3|3]] For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.

3: 

[[Mic.1.4|4]] And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, \[and\] as the waters \[that are\] poured down a steep place.

4: 

[[Mic.1.5|5]] For the transgression of Jacob \[is\] all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What \[is\] the transgression of Jacob? \[is it\] not Samaria? and what \[are\] the high places of Judah? \[are they\] not Jerusalem?

5: 

[[Mic.1.6|6]] Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, \[and\] as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.

6: 

[[Mic.1.7|7]] And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered \[it\] of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.

7:
