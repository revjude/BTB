[[Mic.4|Micah 4:6 - Micah 4:13]]
*The Restoration of Zion*

[[Mic.4.6|6]] In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;

6: 

[[Mic.4.7|7]] And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.

7: 

[[Mic.4.8|8]] And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.

8: 

[[Mic.4.9|9]] Now why dost thou cry out aloud? \[is there\] no king in thee? is thy counseller perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.

9: 

[[Mic.4.10|10]] Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go \[even\] to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.

10: 

[[Mic.4.11|11]] Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.

11: 

[[Mic.4.12|12]] But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor.

12: 

[[Mic.4.13|13]] Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.

13:
