[[Mic.7|Micah 7:14 - Micah 7:20]]
*God’s Compassion on Israel*

[[Mic.7.14|14]] Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily \[in\] the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed \[in\] Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.

14: 

[[Mic.7.15|15]] According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous \[things\].

15: 

[[Mic.7.16|16]] The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay \[their\] hand upon \[their\] mouth, their ears shall be deaf.

16: 

[[Mic.7.17|17]] They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.

17: 

[[Mic.7.18|18]] Who \[is\] a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth \[in\] mercy.

18: 

[[Mic.7.19|19]] He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.

19: 

[[Mic.7.20|20]] Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, \[and\] the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.

20:
