[[Mic.1|Micah 1:8 - Micah 1:16]]
*Weeping and Mourning*

[[Mic.1.8|8]] Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.

8: 

[[Mic.1.9|9]] For her wound \[is\] incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, \[even\] to Jerusalem.

9: 

[[Mic.1.10|10]] Declare ye \[it\] not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.

10: 

[[Mic.1.11|11]] Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing.

11: 

[[Mic.1.12|12]] For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.

12: 

[[Mic.1.13|13]] O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she \[is\] the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.

13: 

[[Mic.1.14|14]] Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib \[shall be\] a lie to the kings of Israel.

14: 

[[Mic.1.15|15]] Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.

15: 

[[Mic.1.16|16]] Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.

16:
