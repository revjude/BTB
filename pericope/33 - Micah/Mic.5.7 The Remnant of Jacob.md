[[Mic.5|Micah 5:7 - Micah 5:15]]
*The Remnant of Jacob*

[[Mic.5.7|7]] And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.

7: 

[[Mic.5.8|8]] And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.

8: 

[[Mic.5.9|9]] Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.

9: 

[[Mic.5.10|10]] And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots:

10: 

[[Mic.5.11|11]] And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds:

11: 

[[Mic.5.12|12]] And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no \[more\] soothsayers:

12: 

[[Mic.5.13|13]] Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands.

13: 

[[Mic.5.14|14]] And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities.

14: 

[[Mic.5.15|15]] And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.

15:
