[[Mic.6|Micah 6:9 - Micah 6:16]]
*The Punishment of Israel*

[[Mic.6.9|9]] The LORD’S voice crieth unto the city, and \[the man of\] wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.

9: 

[[Mic.6.10|10]] Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure \[that is\] abominable?

10: 

[[Mic.6.11|11]] Shall I count \[them\] pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?

11: 

[[Mic.6.12|12]] For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue \[is\] deceitful in their mouth.

12: 

[[Mic.6.13|13]] Therefore also will I make \[thee\] sick in smiting thee, in making \[thee\] desolate because of thy sins.

13: 

[[Mic.6.14|14]] Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down \[shall be\] in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and \[that\] which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.

14: 

[[Mic.6.15|15]] Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.

15: 

[[Mic.6.16|16]] For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.

16:
