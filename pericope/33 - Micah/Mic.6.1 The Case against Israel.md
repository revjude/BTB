[[Mic.6|Micah 6:1 - Micah 6:8]]
*The Case against Israel*

[[Mic.6.1|1]] Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.

1: 

[[Mic.6.2|2]] Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD’S controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.

2: 

[[Mic.6.3|3]] O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.

3: 

[[Mic.6.4|4]] For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

4: 

[[Mic.6.5|5]] O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.

5: 

[[Mic.6.6|6]] Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, \[and\] bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?

6: 

[[Mic.6.7|7]] Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, \[or\] with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn \[for\] my transgression, the fruit of my body \[for\] the sin of my soul?

7: 

[[Mic.6.8|8]] He hath shewed thee, O man, what \[is\] good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?

8:
