[[2Cor.4|2 Corinthians 4:1 - 2 Corinthians 4:6]]
*The Light of the Gospel*

[[2Cor.4.1|1]] Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;

1: 

[[2Cor.4.2|2]] But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.

2: 

[[2Cor.4.3|3]] But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:

3: 

[[2Cor.4.4|4]] In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.

4: 

[[2Cor.4.5|5]] For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake.

5: 

[[2Cor.4.6|6]] For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to \[give\] the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

6:
