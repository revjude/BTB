[[2Cor.12|2 Corinthians 12:11 - 2 Corinthians 12:21]]
*Paul’s Concern for the Corinthians*

[[2Cor.12.11|11]] I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.

11: 

[[2Cor.12.12|12]] Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.

12: 

[[2Cor.12.13|13]] For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except \[it be\] that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.

13: 

[[2Cor.12.14|14]] Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.

14: 

[[2Cor.12.15|15]] And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.

15: 

[[2Cor.12.16|16]] But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.

16: 

[[2Cor.12.17|17]] Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?

17: 

[[2Cor.12.18|18]] I desired Titus, and with \[him\] I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? \[walked we\] not in the same steps?

18: 

[[2Cor.12.19|19]] Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but \[we do\] all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.

19: 

[[2Cor.12.20|20]] For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and \[that\] I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest \[there be\] debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:

20: 

[[2Cor.12.21|21]] \[And\] lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and \[that\] I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.

21:
