[[2Cor.6|2 Corinthians 6:14 - 2 Corinthians 6:18]]
*Do Not Be Unequally Yoked*

[[2Cor.6.14|14]] Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?

14: 

[[2Cor.6.15|15]] And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?

15: 

[[2Cor.6.16|16]] And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in \[them\]; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

16: 

[[2Cor.6.17|17]] Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean \[thing\]; and I will receive you,

17: 

[[2Cor.6.18|18]] And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.

18:
