[[2Cor.5|2 Corinthians 5:1 - 2 Corinthians 5:10]]
*Our Eternal Dwelling*

[[2Cor.5.1|1]] For we know that if our earthly house of \[this\] tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

1: 

[[2Cor.5.2|2]] For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:

2: 

[[2Cor.5.3|3]] If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.

3: 

[[2Cor.5.4|4]] For we that are in \[this\] tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.

4: 

[[2Cor.5.5|5]] Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing \[is\] God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.

5: 

[[2Cor.5.6|6]] Therefore \[we are\] always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:

6: 

[[2Cor.5.7|7]] (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)

7: 

[[2Cor.5.8|8]] We are confident, \[I say\], and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.

8: 

[[2Cor.5.9|9]] Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.

9: 

[[2Cor.5.10|10]] For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things \[done\] in \[his\] body, according to that he hath done, whether \[it be\] good or bad.

10:
