[[2Cor.10|2 Corinthians 10:1 - 2 Corinthians 10:18]]
*Paul’s Apostolic Authority*

[[2Cor.10.1|1]] Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence \[am\] base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:

1: 

[[2Cor.10.2|2]] But I beseech \[you\], that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.

2: 

[[2Cor.10.3|3]] For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:

3: 

[[2Cor.10.4|4]] (For the weapons of our warfare \[are\] not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)

4: 

[[2Cor.10.5|5]] Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;

5: 

[[2Cor.10.6|6]] And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.

6: 

[[2Cor.10.7|7]] Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he \[is\] Christ’s, even so \[are\] we Christ’s.

7: 

[[2Cor.10.8|8]] For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:

8: 

[[2Cor.10.9|9]] That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.

9: 

[[2Cor.10.10|10]] For \[his\] letters, say they, \[are\] weighty and powerful; but \[his\] bodily presence \[is\] weak, and \[his\] speech contemptible.

10: 

[[2Cor.10.11|11]] Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such \[will we be\] also in deed when we are present.

11: 

[[2Cor.10.12|12]] For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.

12: 

[[2Cor.10.13|13]] But we will not boast of things without \[our\] measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.

13: 

[[2Cor.10.14|14]] For we stretch not ourselves beyond \[our measure\], as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in \[preaching\] the gospel of Christ:

14: 

[[2Cor.10.15|15]] Not boasting of things without \[our\] measure, \[that is\], of other men’s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,

15: 

[[2Cor.10.16|16]] To preach the gospel in the \[regions\] beyond you, \[and\] not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to our hand.

16: 

[[2Cor.10.17|17]] But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.

17: 

[[2Cor.10.18|18]] For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.

18:
