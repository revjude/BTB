[[2Cor.2|2 Corinthians 2:12 - 2 Corinthians 2:17]]
*Triumph in Christ*

[[2Cor.2.12|12]] Furthermore, when I came to Troas to \[preach\] Christ’s gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,

12: 

[[2Cor.2.13|13]] I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.

13: 

[[2Cor.2.14|14]] Now thanks \[be\] unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.

14: 

[[2Cor.2.15|15]] For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:

15: 

[[2Cor.2.16|16]] To the one \[we are\] the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who \[is\] sufficient for these things?

16: 

[[2Cor.2.17|17]] For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.

17:
