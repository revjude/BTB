[[2Cor.3|2 Corinthians 3:1 - 2 Corinthians 3:6]]
*Ministers of a New Covenant*

[[2Cor.3.1|1]] Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some \[others\], epistles of commendation to you, or \[letters\] of commendation from you?

1: 

[[2Cor.3.2|2]] Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:

2: 

[[2Cor.3.3|3]] \[Forasmuch as ye are\] manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.

3: 

[[2Cor.3.4|4]] And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:

4: 

[[2Cor.3.5|5]] Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency \[is\] of God;

5: 

[[2Cor.3.6|6]] Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.

6:
