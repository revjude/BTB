[[2Cor.11|2 Corinthians 11:16 - 2 Corinthians 11:33]]
*Paul’s Suffering and Service*

[[2Cor.11.16|16]] I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.

16: 

[[2Cor.11.17|17]] That which I speak, I speak \[it\] not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.

17: 

[[2Cor.11.18|18]] Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.

18: 

[[2Cor.11.19|19]] For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye \[yourselves\] are wise.

19: 

[[2Cor.11.20|20]] For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour \[you\], if a man take \[of you\], if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.

20: 

[[2Cor.11.21|21]] I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.

21: 

[[2Cor.11.22|22]] Are they Hebrews? so \[am\] I. Are they Israelites? so \[am\] I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so \[am\] I.

22: 

[[2Cor.11.23|23]] Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I \[am\] more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.

23: 

[[2Cor.11.24|24]] Of the Jews five times received I forty \[stripes\] save one.

24: 

[[2Cor.11.25|25]] Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;

25: 

[[2Cor.11.26|26]] \[In\] journeyings often, \[in\] perils of waters, \[in\] perils of robbers, \[in\] perils by \[mine own\] countrymen, \[in\] perils by the heathen, \[in\] perils in the city, \[in\] perils in the wilderness, \[in\] perils in the sea, \[in\] perils among false brethren;

26: 

[[2Cor.11.27|27]] In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.

27: 

[[2Cor.11.28|28]] Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.

28: 

[[2Cor.11.29|29]] Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?

29: 

[[2Cor.11.30|30]] If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.

30: 

[[2Cor.11.31|31]] The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.

31: 

[[2Cor.11.32|32]] In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:

32: 

[[2Cor.11.33|33]] And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.

33:
