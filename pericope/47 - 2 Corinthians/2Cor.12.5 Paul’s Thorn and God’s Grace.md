[[2Cor.12|2 Corinthians 12:5 - 2 Corinthians 12:10]]
*Paul’s Thorn and God’s Grace*

[[2Cor.12.5|5]] Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.

5: 

[[2Cor.12.6|6]] For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but \[now\] I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me \[to be\], or \[that\] he heareth of me.

6: 

[[2Cor.12.7|7]] And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.

7: 

[[2Cor.12.8|8]] For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.

8: 

[[2Cor.12.9|9]] And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.

9: 

[[2Cor.12.10|10]] Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.

10:
