[[2Cor.8|2 Corinthians 8:1 - 2 Corinthians 8:15]]
*Generosity Commended*

[[2Cor.8.1|1]] Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;

1: 

[[2Cor.8.2|2]] How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.

2: 

[[2Cor.8.3|3]] For to \[their\] power, I bear record, yea, and beyond \[their\] power \[they were\] willing of themselves;

3: 

[[2Cor.8.4|4]] Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and \[take upon us\] the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.

4: 

[[2Cor.8.5|5]] And \[this they did\], not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.

5: 

[[2Cor.8.6|6]] Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.

6: 

[[2Cor.8.7|7]] Therefore, as ye abound in every \[thing, in\] faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and \[in\] all diligence, and \[in\] your love to us, \[see\] that ye abound in this grace also.

7: 

[[2Cor.8.8|8]] I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.

8: 

[[2Cor.8.9|9]] For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.

9: 

[[2Cor.8.10|10]] And herein I give \[my\] advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.

10: 

[[2Cor.8.11|11]] Now therefore perform the doing \[of it\]; that as \[there was\] a readiness to will, so \[there may be\] a performance also out of that which ye have.

11: 

[[2Cor.8.12|12]] For if there be first a willing mind, \[it is\] accepted according to that a man hath, \[and\] not according to that he hath not.

12: 

[[2Cor.8.13|13]] For \[I mean\] not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:

13: 

[[2Cor.8.14|14]] But by an equality, \[that\] now at this time your abundance \[may be a supply\] for their want, that their abundance also may be \[a supply\] for your want: that there may be equality:

14: 

[[2Cor.8.15|15]] As it is written, He that \[had gathered\] much had nothing over; and he that \[had gathered\] little had no lack.

15:
