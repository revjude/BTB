[[2Cor.3|2 Corinthians 3:7 - 2 Corinthians 3:18]]
*The Glory of the New Covenant*

[[2Cor.3.7|7]] But if the ministration of death, written \[and\] engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which \[glory\] was to be done away:

7: 

[[2Cor.3.8|8]] How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?

8: 

[[2Cor.3.9|9]] For if the ministration of condemnation \[be\] glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.

9: 

[[2Cor.3.10|10]] For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.

10: 

[[2Cor.3.11|11]] For if that which is done away \[was\] glorious, much more that which remaineth \[is\] glorious.

11: 

[[2Cor.3.12|12]] Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:

12: 

[[2Cor.3.13|13]] And not as Moses, \[which\] put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:

13: 

[[2Cor.3.14|14]] But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which \[vail\] is done away in Christ.

14: 

[[2Cor.3.15|15]] But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.

15: 

[[2Cor.3.16|16]] Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.

16: 

[[2Cor.3.17|17]] Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord \[is\], there \[is\] liberty.

17: 

[[2Cor.3.18|18]] But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, \[even\] as by the Spirit of the Lord.

18:
