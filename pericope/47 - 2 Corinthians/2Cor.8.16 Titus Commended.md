[[2Cor.8|2 Corinthians 8:16 - 2 Corinthians 8:24]]
*Titus Commended*

[[2Cor.8.16|16]] But thanks \[be\] to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.

16: 

[[2Cor.8.17|17]] For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.

17: 

[[2Cor.8.18|18]] And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise \[is\] in the gospel throughout all the churches;

18: 

[[2Cor.8.19|19]] And not \[that\] only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and \[declaration of\] your ready mind:

19: 

[[2Cor.8.20|20]] Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:

20: 

[[2Cor.8.21|21]] Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.

21: 

[[2Cor.8.22|22]] And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which \[I have\] in you.

22: 

[[2Cor.8.23|23]] Whether \[any do inquire\] of Titus, \[he is\] my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren \[be inquired of, they are\] the messengers of the churches, \[and\] the glory of Christ.

23: 

[[2Cor.8.24|24]] Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.

24:
