[[2Cor.6|2 Corinthians 6:1 - 2 Corinthians 6:13]]
*Paul’s Hardships and God’s Grace*

[[2Cor.6.1|1]] We then, \[as\] workers together \[with him\], beseech \[you\] also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.

1: 

[[2Cor.6.2|2]] (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now \[is\] the accepted time; behold, now \[is\] the day of salvation.)

2: 

[[2Cor.6.3|3]] Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:

3: 

[[2Cor.6.4|4]] But in all \[things\] approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,

4: 

[[2Cor.6.5|5]] In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;

5: 

[[2Cor.6.6|6]] By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,

6: 

[[2Cor.6.7|7]] By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,

7: 

[[2Cor.6.8|8]] By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and \[yet\] true;

8: 

[[2Cor.6.9|9]] As unknown, and \[yet\] well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;

9: 

[[2Cor.6.10|10]] As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and \[yet\] possessing all things.

10: 

[[2Cor.6.11|11]] O \[ye\] Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.

11: 

[[2Cor.6.12|12]] Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.

12: 

[[2Cor.6.13|13]] Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto \[my\] children,) be ye also enlarged.

13:
