[[2Cor.11|2 Corinthians 11:1 - 2 Corinthians 11:15]]
*Paul and the False Apostles*

[[2Cor.11.1|1]] Would to God ye could bear with me a little in \[my\] folly: and indeed bear with me.

1: 

[[2Cor.11.2|2]] For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present \[you as\] a chaste virgin to Christ.

2: 

[[2Cor.11.3|3]] But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.

3: 

[[2Cor.11.4|4]] For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or \[if\] ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with \[him\].

4: 

[[2Cor.11.5|5]] For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.

5: 

[[2Cor.11.6|6]] But though \[I be\] rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.

6: 

[[2Cor.11.7|7]] Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?

7: 

[[2Cor.11.8|8]] I robbed other churches, taking wages \[of them\], to do you service.

8: 

[[2Cor.11.9|9]] And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all \[things\] I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and \[so\] will I keep \[myself\].

9: 

[[2Cor.11.10|10]] As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.

10: 

[[2Cor.11.11|11]] Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.

11: 

[[2Cor.11.12|12]] But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.

12: 

[[2Cor.11.13|13]] For such \[are\] false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.

13: 

[[2Cor.11.14|14]] And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.

14: 

[[2Cor.11.15|15]] Therefore \[it is\] no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.

15:
