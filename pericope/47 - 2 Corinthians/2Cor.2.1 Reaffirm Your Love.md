[[2Cor.2|2 Corinthians 2:1 - 2 Corinthians 2:11]]
*Reaffirm Your Love*

[[2Cor.2.1|1]] But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.

1: 

[[2Cor.2.2|2]] For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?

2: 

[[2Cor.2.3|3]] And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is \[the joy\] of you all.

3: 

[[2Cor.2.4|4]] For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.

4: 

[[2Cor.2.5|5]] But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.

5: 

[[2Cor.2.6|6]] Sufficient to such a man \[is\] this punishment, which \[was inflicted\] of many.

6: 

[[2Cor.2.7|7]] So that contrariwise ye \[ought\] rather to forgive \[him\], and comfort \[him\], lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.

7: 

[[2Cor.2.8|8]] Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm \[your\] love toward him.

8: 

[[2Cor.2.9|9]] For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.

9: 

[[2Cor.2.10|10]] To whom ye forgive any thing, I \[forgive\] also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave \[it\], for your sakes \[forgave I it\] in the person of Christ;

10: 

[[2Cor.2.11|11]] Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.

11:
