[[2Cor.4|2 Corinthians 4:7 - 2 Corinthians 4:18]]
*Treasure in Jars of Clay*

[[2Cor.4.7|7]] But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.

7: 

[[2Cor.4.8|8]] \[We are\] troubled on every side, yet not distressed; \[we are\] perplexed, but not in despair;

8: 

[[2Cor.4.9|9]] Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;

9: 

[[2Cor.4.10|10]] Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.

10: 

[[2Cor.4.11|11]] For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.

11: 

[[2Cor.4.12|12]] So then death worketh in us, but life in you.

12: 

[[2Cor.4.13|13]] We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;

13: 

[[2Cor.4.14|14]] Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present \[us\] with you.

14: 

[[2Cor.4.15|15]] For all things \[are\] for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.

15: 

[[2Cor.4.16|16]] For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward \[man\] is renewed day by day.

16: 

[[2Cor.4.17|17]] For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding \[and\] eternal weight of glory;

17: 

[[2Cor.4.18|18]] While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen \[are\] temporal; but the things which are not seen \[are\] eternal.

18:
