[[Gen.35|Genesis 35:16 - Genesis 35:20]]
*Benjamin Born, Rachel Dies*

[[Gen.35.16|16]] And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.

16: 

[[Gen.35.17|17]] And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.

17: 

[[Gen.35.18|18]] And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.

18: 

[[Gen.35.19|19]] And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which \[is\] Bethlehem.

19: 

[[Gen.35.20|20]] And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that \[is\] the pillar of Rachel’s grave unto this day.

20:
