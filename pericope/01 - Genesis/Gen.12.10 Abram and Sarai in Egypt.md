[[Gen.12|Genesis 12:10 - Genesis 12:20]]
*Abram and Sarai in Egypt*

[[Gen.12.10|10]] And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine \[was\] grievous in the land.

10: 

[[Gen.12.11|11]] And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou \[art\] a fair woman to look upon:

11: 

[[Gen.12.12|12]] Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This \[is\] his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.

12: 

[[Gen.12.13|13]] Say, I pray thee, thou \[art\] my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.

13: 

[[Gen.12.14|14]] And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she \[was\] very fair.

14: 

[[Gen.12.15|15]] The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.

15: 

[[Gen.12.16|16]] And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.

16: 

[[Gen.12.17|17]] And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife.

17: 

[[Gen.12.18|18]] And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What \[is\] this \[that\] thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she \[was\] thy wife?

18: 

[[Gen.12.19|19]] Why saidst thou, She \[is\] my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take \[her\], and go thy way.

19: 

[[Gen.12.20|20]] And Pharaoh commanded \[his\] men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.

20:
