[[Gen.20|Genesis 20:1 - Genesis 20:18]]
*Abraham, Sarah, and Abimelech*

[[Gen.20.1|1]] And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.

1: 

[[Gen.20.2|2]] And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She \[is\] my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.

2: 

[[Gen.20.3|3]] But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou \[art but\] a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she \[is\] a man’s wife.

3: 

[[Gen.20.4|4]] But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?

4: 

[[Gen.20.5|5]] Said he not unto me, She \[is\] my sister? and she, even she herself said, He \[is\] my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.

5: 

[[Gen.20.6|6]] And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.

6: 

[[Gen.20.7|7]] Now therefore restore the man \[his\] wife; for he \[is\] a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore \[her\] not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that \[are\] thine.

7: 

[[Gen.20.8|8]] Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.

8: 

[[Gen.20.9|9]] Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.

9: 

[[Gen.20.10|10]] And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?

10: 

[[Gen.20.11|11]] And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God \[is\] not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife’s sake.

11: 

[[Gen.20.12|12]] And yet indeed \[she is\] my sister; she \[is\] the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.

12: 

[[Gen.20.13|13]] And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said unto her, This \[is\] thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He \[is\] my brother.

13: 

[[Gen.20.14|14]] And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave \[them\] unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.

14: 

[[Gen.20.15|15]] And Abimelech said, Behold, my land \[is\] before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.

15: 

[[Gen.20.16|16]] And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand \[pieces\] of silver: behold, he \[is\] to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that \[are\] with thee, and with all \[other\]: thus she was reproved.

16: 

[[Gen.20.17|17]] So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare \[children\].

17: 

[[Gen.20.18|18]] For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham’s wife.

18:
