[[Gen.25|Genesis 25:29 - Genesis 25:34]]
*Esau Sells His Birthright*

[[Gen.25.29|29]] And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he \[was\] faint:

29: 

[[Gen.25.30|30]] And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red \[pottage\]; for I \[am\] faint: therefore was his name called Edom.

30: 

[[Gen.25.31|31]] And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.

31: 

[[Gen.25.32|32]] And Esau said, Behold, I \[am\] at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?

32: 

[[Gen.25.33|33]] And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.

33: 

[[Gen.25.34|34]] Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised \[his\] birthright.

34:
