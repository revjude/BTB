[[Gen.37|Genesis 37:12 - Genesis 37:30]]
*Joseph Sold into Egypt*

[[Gen.37.12|12]] And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.

12: 

[[Gen.37.13|13]] And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed \[the flock\] in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here \[am I\].

13: 

[[Gen.37.14|14]] And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.

14: 

[[Gen.37.15|15]] And a certain man found him, and, behold, \[he was\] wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?

15: 

[[Gen.37.16|16]] And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed \[their flocks\].

16: 

[[Gen.37.17|17]] And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.

17: 

[[Gen.37.18|18]] And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.

18: 

[[Gen.37.19|19]] And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.

19: 

[[Gen.37.20|20]] Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.

20: 

[[Gen.37.21|21]] And Reuben heard \[it\], and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.

21: 

[[Gen.37.22|22]] And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, \[but\] cast him into this pit that \[is\] in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.

22: 

[[Gen.37.23|23]] And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, \[his\] coat of \[many\] colours that \[was\] on him;

23: 

[[Gen.37.24|24]] And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit \[was\] empty, \[there was\] no water in it.

24: 

[[Gen.37.25|25]] And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry \[it\] down to Egypt.

25: 

[[Gen.37.26|26]] And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit \[is it\] if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?

26: 

[[Gen.37.27|27]] Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he \[is\] our brother \[and\] our flesh. And his brethren were content.

27: 

[[Gen.37.28|28]] Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty \[pieces\] of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.

28: 

[[Gen.37.29|29]] And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph \[was\] not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.

29: 

[[Gen.37.30|30]] And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child \[is\] not; and I, whither shall I go?

30:
