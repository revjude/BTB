[[Gen.13|Genesis 13:1 - Genesis 13:9]]
*Abram and Lot Part Ways*

[[Gen.13.1|1]] And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.

1: 

[[Gen.13.2|2]] And Abram \[was\] very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

2: 

[[Gen.13.3|3]] And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;

3: 

[[Gen.13.4|4]] Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.

4: 

[[Gen.13.5|5]] And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.

5: 

[[Gen.13.6|6]] And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.

6: 

[[Gen.13.7|7]] And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.

7: 

[[Gen.13.8|8]] And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we \[be\] brethren.

8: 

[[Gen.13.9|9]] \[Is\] not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if \[thou wilt take\] the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if \[thou depart\] to the right hand, then I will go to the left.

9:
