[[Gen.29|Genesis 29:14 - Genesis 29:30]]
*Jacob Marries Leah and Rachel*

[[Gen.29.14|14]] And Laban said to him, Surely thou \[art\] my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.

14: 

[[Gen.29.15|15]] And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou \[art\] my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what \[shall\] thy wages \[be\]?

15: 

[[Gen.29.16|16]] And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder \[was\] Leah, and the name of the younger \[was\] Rachel.

16: 

[[Gen.29.17|17]] Leah \[was\] tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.

17: 

[[Gen.29.18|18]] And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.

18: 

[[Gen.29.19|19]] And Laban said, \[It is\] better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.

19: 

[[Gen.29.20|20]] And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him \[but\] a few days, for the love he had to her.

20: 

[[Gen.29.21|21]] And Jacob said unto Laban, Give \[me\] my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.

21: 

[[Gen.29.22|22]] And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.

22: 

[[Gen.29.23|23]] And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.

23: 

[[Gen.29.24|24]] And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid \[for\] an handmaid.

24: 

[[Gen.29.25|25]] And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it \[was\] Leah: and he said to Laban, What \[is\] this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?

25: 

[[Gen.29.26|26]] And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.

26: 

[[Gen.29.27|27]] Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.

27: 

[[Gen.29.28|28]] And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.

28: 

[[Gen.29.29|29]] And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.

29: 

[[Gen.29.30|30]] And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
