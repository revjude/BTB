[[Gen.18|Genesis 18:1 - Genesis 18:8]]
*The Three Visitors*

[[Gen.18.1|1]] And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;

1: 

[[Gen.18.2|2]] And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw \[them\], he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,

2: 

[[Gen.18.3|3]] And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:

3: 

[[Gen.18.4|4]] Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:

4: 

[[Gen.18.5|5]] And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.

5: 

[[Gen.18.6|6]] And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead \[it\], and make cakes upon the hearth.

6: 

[[Gen.18.7|7]] And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave \[it\] unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.

7: 

[[Gen.18.8|8]] And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set \[it\] before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.

8:
