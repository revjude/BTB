[[Gen.38|Genesis 38:1 - Genesis 38:26]]
*Judah and Tamar*

[[Gen.38.1|1]] And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name \[was\] Hirah.

1: 

[[Gen.38.2|2]] And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name \[was\] Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.

2: 

[[Gen.38.3|3]] And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.

3: 

[[Gen.38.4|4]] And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.

4: 

[[Gen.38.5|5]] And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.

5: 

[[Gen.38.6|6]] And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name \[was\] Tamar.

6: 

[[Gen.38.7|7]] And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.

7: 

[[Gen.38.8|8]] And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.

8: 

[[Gen.38.9|9]] And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled \[it\] on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.

9: 

[[Gen.38.10|10]] And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.

10: 

[[Gen.38.11|11]] Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren \[did\]. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.

11: 

[[Gen.38.12|12]] And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah’s wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.

12: 

[[Gen.38.13|13]] And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.

13: 

[[Gen.38.14|14]] And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which \[is\] by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.

14: 

[[Gen.38.15|15]] When Judah saw her, he thought her \[to be\] an harlot; because she had covered her face.

15: 

[[Gen.38.16|16]] And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she \[was\] his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?

16: 

[[Gen.38.17|17]] And he said, I will send \[thee\] a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give \[me\] a pledge, till thou send \[it\]?

17: 

[[Gen.38.18|18]] And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that \[is\] in thine hand. And he gave \[it\] her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.

18: 

[[Gen.38.19|19]] And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.

19: 

[[Gen.38.20|20]] And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive \[his\] pledge from the woman’s hand: but he found her not.

20: 

[[Gen.38.21|21]] Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where \[is\] the harlot, that \[was\] openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this \[place\].

21: 

[[Gen.38.22|22]] And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, \[that\] there was no harlot in this \[place\].

22: 

[[Gen.38.23|23]] And Judah said, Let her take \[it\] to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.

23: 

[[Gen.38.24|24]] And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she \[is\] with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.

24: 

[[Gen.38.25|25]] When she \[was\] brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these \[are, am\] I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose \[are\] these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.

25: 

[[Gen.38.26|26]] And Judah acknowledged \[them\], and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.

26:
