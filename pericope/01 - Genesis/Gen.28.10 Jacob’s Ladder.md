[[Gen.28|Genesis 28:10 - Genesis 28:17]]
*Jacob’s Ladder*

[[Gen.28.10|10]] And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.

10: 

[[Gen.28.11|11]] And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put \[them for\] his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.

11: 

[[Gen.28.12|12]] And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.

12: 

[[Gen.28.13|13]] And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I \[am\] the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;

13: 

[[Gen.28.14|14]] And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.

14: 

[[Gen.28.15|15]] And, behold, I \[am\] with thee, and will keep thee in all \[places\] whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done \[that\] which I have spoken to thee of.

15: 

[[Gen.28.16|16]] And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew \[it\] not.

16: 

[[Gen.28.17|17]] And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful \[is\] this place! this \[is\] none other but the house of God, and this \[is\] the gate of heaven.

17:
