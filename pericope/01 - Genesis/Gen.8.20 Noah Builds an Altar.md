[[Gen.8|Genesis 8:20 - Genesis 8:22]]
*Noah Builds an Altar*

[[Gen.8.20|20]] And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.

20: 

[[Gen.8.21|21]] And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake; for the imagination of man’s heart \[is\] evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.

21: 

[[Gen.8.22|22]] While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.

22:
