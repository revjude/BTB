[[Gen.26|Genesis 26:12 - Genesis 26:25]]
*Isaac’s Prosperity*

[[Gen.26.12|12]] Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.

12: 

[[Gen.26.13|13]] And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:

13: 

[[Gen.26.14|14]] For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.

14: 

[[Gen.26.15|15]] For all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.

15: 

[[Gen.26.16|16]] And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.

16: 

[[Gen.26.17|17]] And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.

17: 

[[Gen.26.18|18]] And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.

18: 

[[Gen.26.19|19]] And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.

19: 

[[Gen.26.20|20]] And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac’s herdmen, saying, The water \[is\] ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.

20: 

[[Gen.26.21|21]] And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.

21: 

[[Gen.26.22|22]] And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.

22: 

[[Gen.26.23|23]] And he went up from thence to Beersheba.

23: 

[[Gen.26.24|24]] And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I \[am\] the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I \[am\] with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham’s sake.

24: 

[[Gen.26.25|25]] And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants digged a well.

25:
