[[Gen.45|Genesis 45:16 - Genesis 45:24]]
*Pharaoh Invites Jacob to Egypt*

[[Gen.45.16|16]] And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, Joseph’s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.

16: 

[[Gen.45.17|17]] And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;

17: 

[[Gen.45.18|18]] And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.

18: 

[[Gen.45.19|19]] Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.

19: 

[[Gen.45.20|20]] Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt \[is\] yours.

20: 

[[Gen.45.21|21]] And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.

21: 

[[Gen.45.22|22]] To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred \[pieces\] of silver, and five changes of raiment.

22: 

[[Gen.45.23|23]] And to his father he sent after this \[manner\]; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.

23: 

[[Gen.45.24|24]] So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.

24:
