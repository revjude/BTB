[[Gen.13|Genesis 13:14 - Genesis 13:18]]
*God Renews the Promise to Abram*

[[Gen.13.14|14]] And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:

14: 

[[Gen.13.15|15]] For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.

15: 

[[Gen.13.16|16]] And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, \[then\] shall thy seed also be numbered.

16: 

[[Gen.13.17|17]] Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.

17: 

[[Gen.13.18|18]] Then Abram removed \[his\] tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which \[is\] in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.

18:
