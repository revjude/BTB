[[Gen.4|Genesis 4:1 - Genesis 4:16]]
*Cain and Abel*

[[Gen.4.1|1]] And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

1: 

[[Gen.4.2|2]] And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

2: 

[[Gen.4.3|3]] And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.

3: 

[[Gen.4.4|4]] And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:

4: 

[[Gen.4.5|5]] But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

5: 

[[Gen.4.6|6]] And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?

6: 

[[Gen.4.7|7]] If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee \[shall be\] his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

7: 

[[Gen.4.8|8]] And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.

8: 

[[Gen.4.9|9]] And the LORD said unto Cain, Where \[is\] Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: \[Am\] I my brother’s keeper?

9: 

[[Gen.4.10|10]] And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.

10: 

[[Gen.4.11|11]] And now \[art\] thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand;

11: 

[[Gen.4.12|12]] When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.

12: 

[[Gen.4.13|13]] And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment \[is\] greater than I can bear.

13: 

[[Gen.4.14|14]] Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, \[that\] every one that findeth me shall slay me.

14: 

[[Gen.4.15|15]] And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.

15: 

[[Gen.4.16|16]] And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

16:
