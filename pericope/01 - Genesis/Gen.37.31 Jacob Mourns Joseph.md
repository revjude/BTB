[[Gen.37|Genesis 37:31 - Genesis 37:36]]
*Jacob Mourns Joseph*

[[Gen.37.31|31]] And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;

31: 

[[Gen.37.32|32]] And they sent the coat of \[many\] colours, and they brought \[it\] to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it \[be\] thy son’s coat or no.

32: 

[[Gen.37.33|33]] And he knew it, and said, \[It is\] my son’s coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.

33: 

[[Gen.37.34|34]] And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.

34: 

[[Gen.37.35|35]] And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.

35: 

[[Gen.37.36|36]] And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, \[and\] captain of the guard.

36:
