[[Gen.11|Genesis 11:27 - Genesis 11:32]]
*Terah’s Descendants*

[[Gen.11.27|27]] Now these \[are\] the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

27: 

[[Gen.11.28|28]] And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

28: 

[[Gen.11.29|29]] And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife \[was\] Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

29: 

[[Gen.11.30|30]] But Sarai was barren; she \[had\] no child.

30: 

[[Gen.11.31|31]] And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.

31: 

[[Gen.11.32|32]] And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
