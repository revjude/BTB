[[Gen.19|Genesis 19:30 - Genesis 19:38]]
*Lot and His Daughters*

[[Gen.19.30|30]] And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.

30: 

[[Gen.19.31|31]] And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father \[is\] old, and \[there is\] not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:

31: 

[[Gen.19.32|32]] Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

32: 

[[Gen.19.33|33]] And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.

33: 

[[Gen.19.34|34]] And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, \[and\] lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

34: 

[[Gen.19.35|35]] And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.

35: 

[[Gen.19.36|36]] Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.

36: 

[[Gen.19.37|37]] And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same \[is\] the father of the Moabites unto this day.

37: 

[[Gen.19.38|38]] And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same \[is\] the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.

38:
