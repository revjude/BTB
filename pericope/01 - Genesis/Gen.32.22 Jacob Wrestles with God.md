[[Gen.32|Genesis 32:22 - Genesis 32:32]]
*Jacob Wrestles with God*

[[Gen.32.22|22]] And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.

22: 

[[Gen.32.23|23]] And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.

23: 

[[Gen.32.24|24]] And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.

24: 

[[Gen.32.25|25]] And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.

25: 

[[Gen.32.26|26]] And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.

26: 

[[Gen.32.27|27]] And he said unto him, What \[is\] thy name? And he said, Jacob.

27: 

[[Gen.32.28|28]] And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.

28: 

[[Gen.32.29|29]] And Jacob asked \[him\], and said, Tell \[me\], I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore \[is\] it \[that\] thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.

29: 

[[Gen.32.30|30]] And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.

30: 

[[Gen.32.31|31]] And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.

31: 

[[Gen.32.32|32]] Therefore the children of Israel eat not \[of\] the sinew which shrank, which \[is\] upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew that shrank.

32:
