[[Gen.39|Genesis 39:1 - Genesis 39:12]]
*Joseph and Potiphar’s Wife*

[[Gen.39.1|1]] And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.

1: 

[[Gen.39.2|2]] And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.

2: 

[[Gen.39.3|3]] And his master saw that the LORD \[was\] with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.

3: 

[[Gen.39.4|4]] And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all \[that\] he had he put into his hand.

4: 

[[Gen.39.5|5]] And it came to pass from the time \[that\] he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.

5: 

[[Gen.39.6|6]] And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was \[a\] goodly \[person\], and well favoured.

6: 

[[Gen.39.7|7]] And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.

7: 

[[Gen.39.8|8]] But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what \[is\] with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;

8: 

[[Gen.39.9|9]] \[There is\] none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou \[art\] his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?

9: 

[[Gen.39.10|10]] And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, \[or\] to be with her.

10: 

[[Gen.39.11|11]] And it came to pass about this time, that \[Joseph\] went into the house to do his business; and \[there was\] none of the men of the house there within.

11: 

[[Gen.39.12|12]] And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.

12:
