[[Gen.49|Genesis 49:1 - Genesis 49:28]]
*Jacob Blesses His Sons*

[[Gen.49.1|1]] And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you \[that\] which shall befall you in the last days.

1: 

[[Gen.49.2|2]] Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.

2: 

[[Gen.49.3|3]] Reuben, thou \[art\] my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:

3: 

[[Gen.49.4|4]] Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed; then defiledst thou \[it\]: he went up to my couch.

4: 

[[Gen.49.5|5]] Simeon and Levi \[are\] brethren; instruments of cruelty \[are in\] their habitations.

5: 

[[Gen.49.6|6]] O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.

6: 

[[Gen.49.7|7]] Cursed \[be\] their anger, for \[it was\] fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.

7: 

[[Gen.49.8|8]] Judah, thou \[art he\] whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand \[shall be\] in the neck of thine enemies; thy father’s children shall bow down before thee.

8: 

[[Gen.49.9|9]] Judah \[is\] a lion’s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?

9: 

[[Gen.49.10|10]] The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him \[shall\] the gathering of the people \[be\].

10: 

[[Gen.49.11|11]] Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:

11: 

[[Gen.49.12|12]] His eyes \[shall be\] red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.

12: 

[[Gen.49.13|13]] Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he \[shall be\] for an haven of ships; and his border \[shall be\] unto Zidon.

13: 

[[Gen.49.14|14]] Issachar \[is\] a strong ass couching down between two burdens:

14: 

[[Gen.49.15|15]] And he saw that rest \[was\] good, and the land that \[it was\] pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.

15: 

[[Gen.49.16|16]] Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

16: 

[[Gen.49.17|17]] Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.

17: 

[[Gen.49.18|18]] I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.

18: 

[[Gen.49.19|19]] Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.

19: 

[[Gen.49.20|20]] Out of Asher his bread \[shall be\] fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.

20: 

[[Gen.49.21|21]] Naphtali \[is\] a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.

21: 

[[Gen.49.22|22]] Joseph \[is\] a fruitful bough, \[even\] a fruitful bough by a well; \[whose\] branches run over the wall:

22: 

[[Gen.49.23|23]] The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot \[at him\], and hated him:

23: 

[[Gen.49.24|24]] But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty \[God\] of Jacob; (from thence \[is\] the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)

24: 

[[Gen.49.25|25]] \[Even\] by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:

25: 

[[Gen.49.26|26]] The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.

26: 

[[Gen.49.27|27]] Benjamin shall ravin \[as\] a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.

27: 

[[Gen.49.28|28]] All these \[are\] the twelve tribes of Israel: and this \[is it\] that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.

28:
