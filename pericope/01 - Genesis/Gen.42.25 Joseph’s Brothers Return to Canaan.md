[[Gen.42|Genesis 42:25 - Genesis 42:38]]
*Joseph’s Brothers Return to Canaan*

[[Gen.42.25|25]] Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.

25: 

[[Gen.42.26|26]] And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.

26: 

[[Gen.42.27|27]] And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it \[was\] in his sack’s mouth.

27: 

[[Gen.42.28|28]] And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, \[it is\] even in my sack: and their heart failed \[them\], and they were afraid, saying one to another, What \[is\] this \[that\] God hath done unto us?

28: 

[[Gen.42.29|29]] And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,

29: 

[[Gen.42.30|30]] The man, \[who is\] the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.

30: 

[[Gen.42.31|31]] And we said unto him, We \[are\] true \[men\]; we are no spies:

31: 

[[Gen.42.32|32]] We \[be\] twelve brethren, sons of our father; one \[is\] not, and the youngest \[is\] this day with our father in the land of Canaan.

32: 

[[Gen.42.33|33]] And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye \[are\] true \[men\]; leave one of your brethren \[here\] with me, and take \[food for\] the famine of your households, and be gone:

33: 

[[Gen.42.34|34]] And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye \[are\] no spies, but \[that\] ye \[are\] true \[men: so\] will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.

34: 

[[Gen.42.35|35]] And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money \[was\] in his sack: and when \[both\] they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.

35: 

[[Gen.42.36|36]] And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved \[of my children\]: Joseph \[is\] not, and Simeon \[is\] not, and ye will take Benjamin \[away\]: all these things are against me.

36: 

[[Gen.42.37|37]] And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.

37: 

[[Gen.42.38|38]] And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

38:
