[[Gen.41|Genesis 41:1 - Genesis 41:13]]
*The Dreams of Pharaoh*

[[Gen.41.1|1]] And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.

1: 

[[Gen.41.2|2]] And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.

2: 

[[Gen.41.3|3]] And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the \[other\] kine upon the brink of the river.

3: 

[[Gen.41.4|4]] And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.

4: 

[[Gen.41.5|5]] And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.

5: 

[[Gen.41.6|6]] And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.

6: 

[[Gen.41.7|7]] And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, \[it was\] a dream.

7: 

[[Gen.41.8|8]] And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but \[there was\] none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.

8: 

[[Gen.41.9|9]] Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:

9: 

[[Gen.41.10|10]] Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard’s house, \[both\] me and the chief baker:

10: 

[[Gen.41.11|11]] And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.

11: 

[[Gen.41.12|12]] And \[there was\] there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.

12: 

[[Gen.41.13|13]] And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.

13:
