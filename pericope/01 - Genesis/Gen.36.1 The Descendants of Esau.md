[[Gen.36|Genesis 36:1 - Genesis 36:19]]
*The Descendants of Esau*

[[Gen.36.1|1]] Now these \[are\] the generations of Esau, who \[is\] Edom.

1: 

[[Gen.36.2|2]] Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;

2: 

[[Gen.36.3|3]] And Bashemath Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebajoth.

3: 

[[Gen.36.4|4]] And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;

4: 

[[Gen.36.5|5]] And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these \[are\] the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.

5: 

[[Gen.36.6|6]] And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.

6: 

[[Gen.36.7|7]] For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.

7: 

[[Gen.36.8|8]] Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau \[is\] Edom.

8: 

[[Gen.36.9|9]] And these \[are\] the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:

9: 

[[Gen.36.10|10]] These \[are\] the names of Esau’s sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.

10: 

[[Gen.36.11|11]] And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.

11: 

[[Gen.36.12|12]] And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau’s son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these \[were\] the sons of Adah Esau’s wife.

12: 

[[Gen.36.13|13]] And these \[are\] the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau’s wife.

13: 

[[Gen.36.14|14]] And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau’s wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.

14: 

[[Gen.36.15|15]] These \[were\] dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn \[son\] of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,

15: 

[[Gen.36.16|16]] Duke Korah, duke Gatam, \[and\] duke Amalek: these \[are\] the dukes \[that came\] of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these \[were\] the sons of Adah.

16: 

[[Gen.36.17|17]] And these \[are\] the sons of Reuel Esau’s son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these \[are\] the dukes \[that came\] of Reuel in the land of Edom; these \[are\] the sons of Bashemath Esau’s wife.

17: 

[[Gen.36.18|18]] And these \[are\] the sons of Aholibamah Esau’s wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these \[were\] the dukes \[that came\] of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau’s wife.

18: 

[[Gen.36.19|19]] These \[are\] the sons of Esau, who \[is\] Edom, and these \[are\] their dukes.
