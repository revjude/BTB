[[Gen.34|Genesis 34:1 - Genesis 34:12]]
*The Defiling of Dinah*

[[Gen.34.1|1]] And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.

1: 

[[Gen.34.2|2]] And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.

2: 

[[Gen.34.3|3]] And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.

3: 

[[Gen.34.4|4]] And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.

4: 

[[Gen.34.5|5]] And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.

5: 

[[Gen.34.6|6]] And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.

6: 

[[Gen.34.7|7]] And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard \[it\]: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter; which thing ought not to be done.

7: 

[[Gen.34.8|8]] And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.

8: 

[[Gen.34.9|9]] And make ye marriages with us, \[and\] give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.

9: 

[[Gen.34.10|10]] And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.

10: 

[[Gen.34.11|11]] And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.

11: 

[[Gen.34.12|12]] Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.

12:
