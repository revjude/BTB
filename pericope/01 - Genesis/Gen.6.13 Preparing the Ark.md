[[Gen.6|Genesis 6:13 - Genesis 6:22]]
*Preparing the Ark*

[[Gen.6.13|13]] And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.

13: 

[[Gen.6.14|14]] Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

14: 

[[Gen.6.15|15]] And this \[is the fashion\] which thou shalt make it \[of\]: The length of the ark \[shall be\] three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.

15: 

[[Gen.6.16|16]] A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; \[with\] lower, second, and third \[stories\] shalt thou make it.

16: 

[[Gen.6.17|17]] And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein \[is\] the breath of life, from under heaven; \[and\] every thing that \[is\] in the earth shall die.

17: 

[[Gen.6.18|18]] But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives with thee.

18: 

[[Gen.6.19|19]] And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every \[sort\] shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep \[them\] alive with thee; they shall be male and female.

19: 

[[Gen.6.20|20]] Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every \[sort\] shall come unto thee, to keep \[them\] alive.

20: 

[[Gen.6.21|21]] And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather \[it\] to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.

21: 

[[Gen.6.22|22]] Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.

22:
