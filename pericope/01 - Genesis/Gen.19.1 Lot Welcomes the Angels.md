[[Gen.19|Genesis 19:1 - Genesis 19:11]]
*Lot Welcomes the Angels*

[[Gen.19.1|1]] And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing \[them\] rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;

1: 

[[Gen.19.2|2]] And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant’s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.

2: 

[[Gen.19.3|3]] And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.

3: 

[[Gen.19.4|4]] But before they lay down, the men of the city, \[even\] the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:

4: 

[[Gen.19.5|5]] And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where \[are\] the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.

5: 

[[Gen.19.6|6]] And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,

6: 

[[Gen.19.7|7]] And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.

7: 

[[Gen.19.8|8]] Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as \[is\] good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.

8: 

[[Gen.19.9|9]] And they said, Stand back. And they said \[again\], This one \[fellow\] came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, \[even\] Lot, and came near to break the door.

9: 

[[Gen.19.10|10]] But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.

10: 

[[Gen.19.11|11]] And they smote the men that \[were\] at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.

11:
