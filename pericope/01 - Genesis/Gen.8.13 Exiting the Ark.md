[[Gen.8|Genesis 8:13 - Genesis 8:19]]
*Exiting the Ark*

[[Gen.8.13|13]] And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first \[month\], the first \[day\] of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.

13: 

[[Gen.8.14|14]] And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.

14: 

[[Gen.8.15|15]] And God spake unto Noah, saying,

15: 

[[Gen.8.16|16]] Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee.

16: 

[[Gen.8.17|17]] Bring forth with thee every living thing that \[is\] with thee, of all flesh, \[both\] of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.

17: 

[[Gen.8.18|18]] And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him:

18: 

[[Gen.8.19|19]] Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, \[and\] whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.

19:
