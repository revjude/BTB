[[Gen.25|Genesis 25:19 - Genesis 25:28]]
*Jacob and Esau*

[[Gen.25.19|19]] And these \[are\] the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begat Isaac:

19: 

[[Gen.25.20|20]] And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.

20: 

[[Gen.25.21|21]] And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she \[was\] barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.

21: 

[[Gen.25.22|22]] And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If \[it be\] so, why \[am\] I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD.

22: 

[[Gen.25.23|23]] And the LORD said unto her, Two nations \[are\] in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and \[the one\] people shall be stronger than \[the other\] people; and the elder shall serve the younger.

23: 

[[Gen.25.24|24]] And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, \[there were\] twins in her womb.

24: 

[[Gen.25.25|25]] And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.

25: 

[[Gen.25.26|26]] And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac \[was\] threescore years old when she bare them.

26: 

[[Gen.25.27|27]] And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob \[was\] a plain man, dwelling in tents.

27: 

[[Gen.25.28|28]] And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of \[his\] venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.

28:
