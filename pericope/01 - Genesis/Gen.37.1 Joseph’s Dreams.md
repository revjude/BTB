[[Gen.37|Genesis 37:1 - Genesis 37:11]]
*Joseph’s Dreams*

[[Gen.37.1|1]] And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.

1: 

[[Gen.37.2|2]] These \[are\] the generations of Jacob. Joseph, \[being\] seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad \[was\] with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.

2: 

[[Gen.37.3|3]] Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he \[was\] the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of \[many\] colours.

3: 

[[Gen.37.4|4]] And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.

4: 

[[Gen.37.5|5]] And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told \[it\] his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.

5: 

[[Gen.37.6|6]] And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:

6: 

[[Gen.37.7|7]] For, behold, we \[were\] binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.

7: 

[[Gen.37.8|8]] And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.

8: 

[[Gen.37.9|9]] And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.

9: 

[[Gen.37.10|10]] And he told \[it\] to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What \[is\] this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?

10: 

[[Gen.37.11|11]] And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.

11:
