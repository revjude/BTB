[[Gen.18|Genesis 18:9 - Genesis 18:15]]
*Sarah Laughs at the Promise*

[[Gen.18.9|9]] And they said unto him, Where \[is\] Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.

9: 

[[Gen.18.10|10]] And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard \[it\] in the tent door, which \[was\] behind him.

10: 

[[Gen.18.11|11]] Now Abraham and Sarah \[were\] old \[and\] well stricken in age; \[and\] it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

11: 

[[Gen.18.12|12]] Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?

12: 

[[Gen.18.13|13]] And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?

13: 

[[Gen.18.14|14]] Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.

14: 

[[Gen.18.15|15]] Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.

15:
