[[Gen.22|Genesis 22:11 - Genesis 22:19]]
*The LORD Provides the Sacrifice*

[[Gen.22.11|11]] And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here \[am\] I.

11: 

[[Gen.22.12|12]] And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only \[son\] from me.

12: 

[[Gen.22.13|13]] And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind \[him\] a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.

13: 

[[Gen.22.14|14]] And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said \[to\] this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.

14: 

[[Gen.22.15|15]] And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,

15: 

[[Gen.22.16|16]] And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only \[son\]:

16: 

[[Gen.22.17|17]] That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which \[is\] upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;

17: 

[[Gen.22.18|18]] And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.

18: 

[[Gen.22.19|19]] So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.

19:
