[[Gen.42|Genesis 42:1 - Genesis 42:24]]
*Joseph’s Brothers Sent to Egypt*

[[Gen.42.1|1]] Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?

1: 

[[Gen.42.2|2]] And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.

2: 

[[Gen.42.3|3]] And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.

3: 

[[Gen.42.4|4]] But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.

4: 

[[Gen.42.5|5]] And the sons of Israel came to buy \[corn\] among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

5: 

[[Gen.42.6|6]] And Joseph \[was\] the governor over the land, \[and\] he \[it was\] that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph’s brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him \[with\] their faces to the earth.

6: 

[[Gen.42.7|7]] And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.

7: 

[[Gen.42.8|8]] And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.

8: 

[[Gen.42.9|9]] And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye \[are\] spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.

9: 

[[Gen.42.10|10]] And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.

10: 

[[Gen.42.11|11]] We \[are\] all one man’s sons; we \[are\] true \[men\], thy servants are no spies.

11: 

[[Gen.42.12|12]] And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.

12: 

[[Gen.42.13|13]] And they said, Thy servants \[are\] twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest \[is\] this day with our father, and one \[is\] not.

13: 

[[Gen.42.14|14]] And Joseph said unto them, That \[is it\] that I spake unto you, saying, Ye \[are\] spies:

14: 

[[Gen.42.15|15]] Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.

15: 

[[Gen.42.16|16]] Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether \[there be any\] truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye \[are\] spies.

16: 

[[Gen.42.17|17]] And he put them all together into ward three days.

17: 

[[Gen.42.18|18]] And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; \[for\] I fear God:

18: 

[[Gen.42.19|19]] If ye \[be\] true \[men\], let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:

19: 

[[Gen.42.20|20]] But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.

20: 

[[Gen.42.21|21]] And they said one to another, We \[are\] verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.

21: 

[[Gen.42.22|22]] And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.

22: 

[[Gen.42.23|23]] And they knew not that Joseph understood \[them\]; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.

23: 

[[Gen.42.24|24]] And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.

24:
