[[Gen.35|Genesis 35:1 - Genesis 35:15]]
*Jacob Returns to Bethel*

[[Gen.35.1|1]] And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.

1: 

[[Gen.35.2|2]] Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that \[were\] with him, Put away the strange gods that \[are\] among you, and be clean, and change your garments:

2: 

[[Gen.35.3|3]] And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.

3: 

[[Gen.35.4|4]] And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which \[were\] in their hand, and \[all their\] earrings which \[were\] in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which \[was\] by Shechem.

4: 

[[Gen.35.5|5]] And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that \[were\] round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.

5: 

[[Gen.35.6|6]] So Jacob came to Luz, which \[is\] in the land of Canaan, that \[is\], Bethel, he and all the people that \[were\] with him.

6: 

[[Gen.35.7|7]] And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.

7: 

[[Gen.35.8|8]] But Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.

8: 

[[Gen.35.9|9]] And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.

9: 

[[Gen.35.10|10]] And God said unto him, Thy name \[is\] Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.

10: 

[[Gen.35.11|11]] And God said unto him, I \[am\] God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;

11: 

[[Gen.35.12|12]] And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.

12: 

[[Gen.35.13|13]] And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.

13: 

[[Gen.35.14|14]] And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, \[even\] a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.

14: 

[[Gen.35.15|15]] And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.

15:
