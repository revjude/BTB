[[Gen.31|Genesis 31:43 - Genesis 31:55]]
*Jacob’s Covenant with Laban*

[[Gen.31.43|43]] And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, \[These\] daughters \[are\] my daughters, and \[these\] children \[are\] my children, and \[these\] cattle \[are\] my cattle, and all that thou seest \[is\] mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?

43: 

[[Gen.31.44|44]] Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.

44: 

[[Gen.31.45|45]] And Jacob took a stone, and set it up \[for\] a pillar.

45: 

[[Gen.31.46|46]] And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.

46: 

[[Gen.31.47|47]] And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.

47: 

[[Gen.31.48|48]] And Laban said, This heap \[is\] a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;

48: 

[[Gen.31.49|49]] And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.

49: 

[[Gen.31.50|50]] If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take \[other\] wives beside my daughters, no man \[is\] with us; see, God \[is\] witness betwixt me and thee.

50: 

[[Gen.31.51|51]] And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold \[this\] pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;

51: 

[[Gen.31.52|52]] This heap \[be\] witness, and \[this\] pillar \[be\] witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.

52: 

[[Gen.31.53|53]] The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.

53: 

[[Gen.31.54|54]] Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.

54: 

[[Gen.31.55|55]] And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.

55:
