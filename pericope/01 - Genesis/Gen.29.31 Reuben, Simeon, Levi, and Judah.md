[[Gen.29|Genesis 29:31 - Genesis 29:35]]
*Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah*

[[Gen.29.31|31]] And when the LORD saw that Leah \[was\] hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel \[was\] barren.

31: 

[[Gen.29.32|32]] And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.

32: 

[[Gen.29.33|33]] And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I \[was\] hated, he hath therefore given me this \[son\] also: and she called his name Simeon.

33: 

[[Gen.29.34|34]] And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.

34: 

[[Gen.29.35|35]] And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.

35:
