[[Gen.3|Genesis 3:21 - Genesis 3:24]]
*The Expulsion from Paradise*

[[Gen.3.21|21]] Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.

21: 

[[Gen.3.22|22]] And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:

22: 

[[Gen.3.23|23]] Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.

23: 

[[Gen.3.24|24]] So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

24:
