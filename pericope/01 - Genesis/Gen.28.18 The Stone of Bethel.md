[[Gen.28|Genesis 28:18 - Genesis 28:22]]
*The Stone of Bethel*

[[Gen.28.18|18]] And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put \[for\] his pillows, and set it up \[for\] a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.

18: 

[[Gen.28.19|19]] And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city \[was called\] Luz at the first.

19: 

[[Gen.28.20|20]] And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,

20: 

[[Gen.28.21|21]] So that I come again to my father’s house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:

21: 

[[Gen.28.22|22]] And this stone, which I have set \[for\] a pillar, shall be God’s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.

22:
