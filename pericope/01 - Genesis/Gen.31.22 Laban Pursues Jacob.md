[[Gen.31|Genesis 31:22 - Genesis 31:42]]
*Laban Pursues Jacob*

[[Gen.31.22|22]] And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.

22: 

[[Gen.31.23|23]] And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days’ journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.

23: 

[[Gen.31.24|24]] And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

24: 

[[Gen.31.25|25]] Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.

25: 

[[Gen.31.26|26]] And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives \[taken\] with the sword?

26: 

[[Gen.31.27|27]] Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?

27: 

[[Gen.31.28|28]] And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in \[so\] doing.

28: 

[[Gen.31.29|29]] It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

29: 

[[Gen.31.30|30]] And now, \[though\] thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father’s house, \[yet\] wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?

30: 

[[Gen.31.31|31]] And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.

31: 

[[Gen.31.32|32]] With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what \[is\] thine with me, and take \[it\] to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.

32: 

[[Gen.31.33|33]] And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the two maidservants’ tents; but he found \[them\] not. Then went he out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent.

33: 

[[Gen.31.34|34]] Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel’s furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found \[them\] not.

34: 

[[Gen.31.35|35]] And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women \[is\] upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.

35: 

[[Gen.31.36|36]] And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What \[is\] my trespass? what \[is\] my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?

36: 

[[Gen.31.37|37]] Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set \[it\] here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.

37: 

[[Gen.31.38|38]] This twenty years \[have\] I \[been\] with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.

38: 

[[Gen.31.39|39]] That which was torn \[of beasts\] I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, \[whether\] stolen by day, or stolen by night.

39: 

[[Gen.31.40|40]] \[Thus\] I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.

40: 

[[Gen.31.41|41]] Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.

41: 

[[Gen.31.42|42]] Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked \[thee\] yesternight.

42:
