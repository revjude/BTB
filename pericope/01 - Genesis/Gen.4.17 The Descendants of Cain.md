[[Gen.4|Genesis 4:17 - Genesis 4:24]]
*The Descendants of Cain*

[[Gen.4.17|17]] And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.

17: 

[[Gen.4.18|18]] And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.

18: 

[[Gen.4.19|19]] And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one \[was\] Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.

19: 

[[Gen.4.20|20]] And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and \[of such as have\] cattle.

20: 

[[Gen.4.21|21]] And his brother’s name \[was\] Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.

21: 

[[Gen.4.22|22]] And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain \[was\] Naamah.

22: 

[[Gen.4.23|23]] And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.

23: 

[[Gen.4.24|24]] If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.

24:
