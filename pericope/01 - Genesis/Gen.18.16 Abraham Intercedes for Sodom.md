[[Gen.18|Genesis 18:16 - Genesis 18:33]]
*Abraham Intercedes for Sodom*

[[Gen.18.16|16]] And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.

16: 

[[Gen.18.17|17]] And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;

17: 

[[Gen.18.18|18]] Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?

18: 

[[Gen.18.19|19]] For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.

19: 

[[Gen.18.20|20]] And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;

20: 

[[Gen.18.21|21]] I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.

21: 

[[Gen.18.22|22]] And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.

22: 

[[Gen.18.23|23]] And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?

23: 

[[Gen.18.24|24]] Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that \[are\] therein?

24: 

[[Gen.18.25|25]] That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?

25: 

[[Gen.18.26|26]] And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

26: 

[[Gen.18.27|27]] And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which \[am but\] dust and ashes:

27: 

[[Gen.18.28|28]] Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for \[lack of\] five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy \[it\].

28: 

[[Gen.18.29|29]] And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do \[it\] for forty’s sake.

29: 

[[Gen.18.30|30]] And he said \[unto him\], Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do \[it\], if I find thirty there.

30: 

[[Gen.18.31|31]] And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy \[it\] for twenty’s sake.

31: 

[[Gen.18.32|32]] And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy \[it\] for ten’s sake.

32: 

[[Gen.18.33|33]] And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.

33:
