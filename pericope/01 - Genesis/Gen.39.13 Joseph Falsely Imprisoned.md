[[Gen.39|Genesis 39:13 - Genesis 39:23]]
*Joseph Falsely Imprisoned*

[[Gen.39.13|13]] And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,

13: 

[[Gen.39.14|14]] That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:

14: 

[[Gen.39.15|15]] And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.

15: 

[[Gen.39.16|16]] And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.

16: 

[[Gen.39.17|17]] And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:

17: 

[[Gen.39.18|18]] And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.

18: 

[[Gen.39.19|19]] And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.

19: 

[[Gen.39.20|20]] And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king’s prisoners \[were\] bound: and he was there in the prison.

20: 

[[Gen.39.21|21]] But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.

21: 

[[Gen.39.22|22]] And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners that \[were\] in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer \[of it\].

22: 

[[Gen.39.23|23]] The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing \[that was\] under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and \[that\] which he did, the LORD made \[it\] to prosper.

23:
