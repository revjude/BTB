[[Gen.15|Genesis 15:1 - Genesis 15:7]]
*God’s Covenant with Abram*

[[Gen.15.1|1]] After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I \[am\] thy shield, \[and\] thy exceeding great reward.

1: 

[[Gen.15.2|2]] And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house \[is\] this Eliezer of Damascus?

2: 

[[Gen.15.3|3]] And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.

3: 

[[Gen.15.4|4]] And, behold, the word of the LORD \[came\] unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.

4: 

[[Gen.15.5|5]] And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.

5: 

[[Gen.15.6|6]] And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.

6: 

[[Gen.15.7|7]] And he said unto him, I \[am\] the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.

7:
