[[Gen.45|Genesis 45:25 - Genesis 45:28]]
*The Revival of Jacob*

[[Gen.45.25|25]] And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,

25: 

[[Gen.45.26|26]] And told him, saying, Joseph \[is\] yet alive, and he \[is\] governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob’s heart fainted, for he believed them not.

26: 

[[Gen.45.27|27]] And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:

27: 

[[Gen.45.28|28]] And Israel said, \[It is\] enough; Joseph my son \[is\] yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.

28:
