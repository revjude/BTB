[[Gen.14|Genesis 14:17 - Genesis 14:24]]
*Melchizedek Blesses Abram*

[[Gen.14.17|17]] And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that \[were\] with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which \[is\] the king’s dale.

17: 

[[Gen.14.18|18]] And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he \[was\] the priest of the most high God.

18: 

[[Gen.14.19|19]] And he blessed him, and said, Blessed \[be\] Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:

19: 

[[Gen.14.20|20]] And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

20: 

[[Gen.14.21|21]] And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.

21: 

[[Gen.14.22|22]] And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,

22: 

[[Gen.14.23|23]] That I will not \[take\] from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that \[is\] thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:

23: 

[[Gen.14.24|24]] Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.

24:
