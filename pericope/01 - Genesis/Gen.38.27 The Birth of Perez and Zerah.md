*The Birth of Perez and Zerah*

[[Gen.38.27|27]] And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins \[were\] in her womb.

27: 

[[Gen.38.28|28]] And it came to pass, when she travailed, that \[the one\] put out \[his\] hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.

28: 

[[Gen.38.29|29]] And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? \[this\] breach \[be\] upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.

29: 

[[Gen.38.30|30]] And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.
