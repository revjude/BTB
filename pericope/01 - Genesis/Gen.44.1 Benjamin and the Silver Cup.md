[[Gen.44|Genesis 44:1 - Genesis 44:17]]
*Benjamin and the Silver Cup*

[[Gen.44.1|1]] And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks \[with\] food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth.

1: 

[[Gen.44.2|2]] And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.

2: 

[[Gen.44.3|3]] As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.

3: 

[[Gen.44.4|4]] \[And\] when they were gone out of the city, \[and\] not \[yet\] far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?

4: 

[[Gen.44.5|5]] \[Is\] not this \[it\] in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.

5: 

[[Gen.44.6|6]] And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.

6: 

[[Gen.44.7|7]] And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:

7: 

[[Gen.44.8|8]] Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold?

8: 

[[Gen.44.9|9]] With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen.

9: 

[[Gen.44.10|10]] And he said, Now also \[let\] it \[be\] according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.

10: 

[[Gen.44.11|11]] Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.

11: 

[[Gen.44.12|12]] And he searched, \[and\] began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.

12: 

[[Gen.44.13|13]] Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.

13: 

[[Gen.44.14|14]] And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; for he \[was\] yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.

14: 

[[Gen.44.15|15]] And Joseph said unto them, What deed \[is\] this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?

15: 

[[Gen.44.16|16]] And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we \[are\] my lord’s servants, both we, and \[he\] also with whom the cup is found.

16: 

[[Gen.44.17|17]] And he said, God forbid that I should do so: \[but\] the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.

17:
