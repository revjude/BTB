[[Gen.24|Genesis 24:62 - Genesis 24:67]]
*Isaac Marries Rebekah*

[[Gen.24.62|62]] And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country.

62: 

[[Gen.24.63|63]] And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels \[were\] coming.

63: 

[[Gen.24.64|64]] And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.

64: 

[[Gen.24.65|65]] For she \[had\] said unto the servant, What man \[is\] this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant \[had\] said, It \[is\] my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.

65: 

[[Gen.24.66|66]] And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.

66: 

[[Gen.24.67|67]] And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s \[death\].

67:
