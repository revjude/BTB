[[Gen.15|Genesis 15:8 - Genesis 15:21]]
*God Confirms His Promise*

[[Gen.15.8|8]] And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?

8: 

[[Gen.15.9|9]] And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.

9: 

[[Gen.15.10|10]] And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.

10: 

[[Gen.15.11|11]] And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.

11: 

[[Gen.15.12|12]] And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.

12: 

[[Gen.15.13|13]] And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land \[that is\] not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;

13: 

[[Gen.15.14|14]] And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.

14: 

[[Gen.15.15|15]] And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.

15: 

[[Gen.15.16|16]] But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites \[is\] not yet full.

16: 

[[Gen.15.17|17]] And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.

17: 

[[Gen.15.18|18]] In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:

18: 

[[Gen.15.19|19]] The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,

19: 

[[Gen.15.20|20]] And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,

20: 

[[Gen.15.21|21]] And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.

21:
