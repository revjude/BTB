[[Gen.11|Genesis 11:1 - Genesis 11:9]]
*The Tower of Babel*

[[Gen.11.1|1]] And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

1: 

[[Gen.11.2|2]] And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.

2: 

[[Gen.11.3|3]] And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.

3: 

[[Gen.11.4|4]] And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top \[may reach\] unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

4: 

[[Gen.11.5|5]] And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.

5: 

[[Gen.11.6|6]] And the LORD said, Behold, the people \[is\] one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.

6: 

[[Gen.11.7|7]] Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.

7: 

[[Gen.11.8|8]] So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.

8: 

[[Gen.11.9|9]] Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

9:
