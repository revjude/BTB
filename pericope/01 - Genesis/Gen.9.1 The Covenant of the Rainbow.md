[[Gen.9|Genesis 9:1 - Genesis 9:17]]
*The Covenant of the Rainbow*

[[Gen.9.1|1]] And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.

1: 

[[Gen.9.2|2]] And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth \[upon\] the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.

2: 

[[Gen.9.3|3]] Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.

3: 

[[Gen.9.4|4]] But flesh with the life thereof, \[which is\] the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.

4: 

[[Gen.9.5|5]] And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man’s brother will I require the life of man.

5: 

[[Gen.9.6|6]] Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.

6: 

[[Gen.9.7|7]] And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.

7: 

[[Gen.9.8|8]] And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

8: 

[[Gen.9.9|9]] And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;

9: 

[[Gen.9.10|10]] And with every living creature that \[is\] with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.

10: 

[[Gen.9.11|11]] And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.

11: 

[[Gen.9.12|12]] And God said, This \[is\] the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that \[is\] with you, for perpetual generations:

12: 

[[Gen.9.13|13]] I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.

13: 

[[Gen.9.14|14]] And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:

14: 

[[Gen.9.15|15]] And I will remember my covenant, which \[is\] between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

15: 

[[Gen.9.16|16]] And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that \[is\] upon the earth.

16: 

[[Gen.9.17|17]] And God said unto Noah, This \[is\] the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that \[is\] upon the earth.

17:
