[[Gen.6|Genesis 6:1 - Genesis 6:7]]
*Corruption on the Earth*

[[Gen.6.1|1]] And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,

1: 

[[Gen.6.2|2]] That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they \[were\] fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.

2: 

[[Gen.6.3|3]] And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also \[is\] flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.

3: 

[[Gen.6.4|4]] There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare \[children\] to them, the same \[became\] mighty men which \[were\] of old, men of renown.

4: 

[[Gen.6.5|5]] And GOD saw that the wickedness of man \[was\] great in the earth, and \[that\] every imagination of the thoughts of his heart \[was\] only evil continually.

5: 

[[Gen.6.6|6]] And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.

6: 

[[Gen.6.7|7]] And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.

7:
