*The Israelites Prosper in Goshen*

[[Gen.47.27|27]] And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.

27: 

[[Gen.47.28|28]] And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.

28: 

[[Gen.47.29|29]] And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:

29: 

[[Gen.47.30|30]] But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.

30: 

[[Gen.47.31|31]] And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed’s head.

31:
