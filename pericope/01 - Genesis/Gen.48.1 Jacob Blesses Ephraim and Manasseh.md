[[Gen.48|Genesis 48:1 - Genesis 48:22]]
*Jacob Blesses Ephraim and Manasseh*

[[Gen.48.1|1]] And it came to pass after these things, that \[one\] told Joseph, Behold, thy father \[is\] sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.

1: 

[[Gen.48.2|2]] And \[one\] told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.

2: 

[[Gen.48.3|3]] And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,

3: 

[[Gen.48.4|4]] And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee \[for\] an everlasting possession.

4: 

[[Gen.48.5|5]] And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, \[are\] mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.

5: 

[[Gen.48.6|6]] And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, \[and\] shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.

6: 

[[Gen.48.7|7]] And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet \[there was\] but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same \[is\] Bethlehem.

7: 

[[Gen.48.8|8]] And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said, Who \[are\] these?

8: 

[[Gen.48.9|9]] And Joseph said unto his father, They \[are\] my sons, whom God hath given me in this \[place\]. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.

9: 

[[Gen.48.10|10]] Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, \[so that\] he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.

10: 

[[Gen.48.11|11]] And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.

11: 

[[Gen.48.12|12]] And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.

12: 

[[Gen.48.13|13]] And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought \[them\] near unto him.

13: 

[[Gen.48.14|14]] And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid \[it\] upon Ephraim’s head, who \[was\] the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh \[was\] the firstborn.

14: 

[[Gen.48.15|15]] And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,

15: 

[[Gen.48.16|16]] The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.

16: 

[[Gen.48.17|17]] And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head.

17: 

[[Gen.48.18|18]] And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this \[is\] the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.

18: 

[[Gen.48.19|19]] And his father refused, and said, I know \[it\], my son, I know \[it\]: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.

19: 

[[Gen.48.20|20]] And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.

20: 

[[Gen.48.21|21]] And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.

21: 

[[Gen.48.22|22]] Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
