[[Gen.43|Genesis 43:1 - Genesis 43:15]]
*The Return to Egypt with Benjamin*

[[Gen.43.1|1]] And the famine \[was\] sore in the land.

1: 

[[Gen.43.2|2]] And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.

2: 

[[Gen.43.3|3]] And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother \[be\] with you.

3: 

[[Gen.43.4|4]] If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:

4: 

[[Gen.43.5|5]] But if thou wilt not send \[him\], we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother \[be\] with you.

5: 

[[Gen.43.6|6]] And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye \[so\] ill with me, \[as\] to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?

6: 

[[Gen.43.7|7]] And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, \[Is\] your father yet alive? have ye \[another\] brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?

7: 

[[Gen.43.8|8]] And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, \[and\] also our little ones.

8: 

[[Gen.43.9|9]] I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:

9: 

[[Gen.43.10|10]] For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.

10: 

[[Gen.43.11|11]] And their father Israel said unto them, If \[it must be\] so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:

11: 

[[Gen.43.12|12]] And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry \[it\] again in your hand; peradventure it \[was\] an oversight:

12: 

[[Gen.43.13|13]] Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:

13: 

[[Gen.43.14|14]] And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved \[of my children\], I am bereaved.

14: 

[[Gen.43.15|15]] And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.

15:
