[[Gen.32|Genesis 32:1 - Genesis 32:21]]
*Jacob Prepares to Meet Esau*

[[Gen.32.1|1]] And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

1: 

[[Gen.32.2|2]] And when Jacob saw them, he said, This \[is\] God’s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.

2: 

[[Gen.32.3|3]] And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.

3: 

[[Gen.32.4|4]] And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:

4: 

[[Gen.32.5|5]] And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.

5: 

[[Gen.32.6|6]] And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.

6: 

[[Gen.32.7|7]] Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that \[was\] with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;

7: 

[[Gen.32.8|8]] And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.

8: 

[[Gen.32.9|9]] And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:

9: 

[[Gen.32.10|10]] I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.

10: 

[[Gen.32.11|11]] Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, \[and\] the mother with the children.

11: 

[[Gen.32.12|12]] And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.

12: 

[[Gen.32.13|13]] And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;

13: 

[[Gen.32.14|14]] Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,

14: 

[[Gen.32.15|15]] Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.

15: 

[[Gen.32.16|16]] And he delivered \[them\] into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.

16: 

[[Gen.32.17|17]] And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose \[art\] thou? and whither goest thou? and whose \[are\] these before thee?

17: 

[[Gen.32.18|18]] Then thou shalt say, \[They be\] thy servant Jacob’s; it \[is\] a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he \[is\] behind us.

18: 

[[Gen.32.19|19]] And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.

19: 

[[Gen.32.20|20]] And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob \[is\] behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.

20: 

[[Gen.32.21|21]] So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.

21:
