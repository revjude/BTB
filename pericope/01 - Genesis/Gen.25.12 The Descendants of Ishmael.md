[[Gen.25|Genesis 25:12 - Genesis 25:18]]
*The Descendants of Ishmael*

[[Gen.25.12|12]] Now these \[are\] the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bare unto Abraham:

12: 

[[Gen.25.13|13]] And these \[are\] the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,

13: 

[[Gen.25.14|14]] And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,

14: 

[[Gen.25.15|15]] Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:

15: 

[[Gen.25.16|16]] These \[are\] the sons of Ishmael, and these \[are\] their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.

16: 

[[Gen.25.17|17]] And these \[are\] the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.

17: 

[[Gen.25.18|18]] And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that \[is\] before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: \[and\] he died in the presence of all his brethren.

18:
