[[Gen.19|Genesis 19:12 - Genesis 19:23]]
*Lot Flees to Zoar*

[[Gen.19.12|12]] And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring \[them\] out of this place:

12: 

[[Gen.19.13|13]] For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.

13: 

[[Gen.19.14|14]] And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.

14: 

[[Gen.19.15|15]] And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

15: 

[[Gen.19.16|16]] And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.

16: 

[[Gen.19.17|17]] And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.

17: 

[[Gen.19.18|18]] And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:

18: 

[[Gen.19.19|19]] Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:

19: 

[[Gen.19.20|20]] Behold now, this city \[is\] near to flee unto, and it \[is\] a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (\[is\] it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.

20: 

[[Gen.19.21|21]] And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.

21: 

[[Gen.19.22|22]] Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

22: 

[[Gen.19.23|23]] The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.

23:
