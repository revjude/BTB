[[Gen.23|Genesis 23:1 - Genesis 23:20]]
*The Death and Burial of Sarah*

[[Gen.23.1|1]] And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: \[these were\] the years of the life of Sarah.

1: 

[[Gen.23.2|2]] And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same \[is\] Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.

2: 

[[Gen.23.3|3]] And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,

3: 

[[Gen.23.4|4]] I \[am\] a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.

4: 

[[Gen.23.5|5]] And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,

5: 

[[Gen.23.6|6]] Hear us, my lord: thou \[art\] a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.

6: 

[[Gen.23.7|7]] And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, \[even\] to the children of Heth.

7: 

[[Gen.23.8|8]] And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,

8: 

[[Gen.23.9|9]] That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which \[is\] in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.

9: 

[[Gen.23.10|10]] And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, \[even\] of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,

10: 

[[Gen.23.11|11]] Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that \[is\] therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.

11: 

[[Gen.23.12|12]] And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.

12: 

[[Gen.23.13|13]] And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou \[wilt give it\], I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take \[it\] of me, and I will bury my dead there.

13: 

[[Gen.23.14|14]] And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,

14: 

[[Gen.23.15|15]] My lord, hearken unto me: the land \[is worth\] four hundred shekels of silver; what \[is\] that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.

15: 

[[Gen.23.16|16]] And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current \[money\] with the merchant.

16: 

[[Gen.23.17|17]] And the field of Ephron, which \[was\] in Machpelah, which \[was\] before Mamre, the field, and the cave which \[was\] therein, and all the trees that \[were\] in the field, that \[were\] in all the borders round about, were made sure

17: 

[[Gen.23.18|18]] Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.

18: 

[[Gen.23.19|19]] And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same \[is\] Hebron in the land of Canaan.

19: 

[[Gen.23.20|20]] And the field, and the cave that \[is\] therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.
