[[Gen.47|Genesis 47:1 - Genesis 47:12]]
*Jacob Settles in Goshen*

[[Gen.47.1|1]] Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they \[are\] in the land of Goshen.

1: 

[[Gen.47.2|2]] And he took some of his brethren, \[even\] five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.

2: 

[[Gen.47.3|3]] And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What \[is\] your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants \[are\] shepherds, both we, \[and\] also our fathers.

3: 

[[Gen.47.4|4]] They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine \[is\] sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.

4: 

[[Gen.47.5|5]] And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:

5: 

[[Gen.47.6|6]] The land of Egypt \[is\] before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest \[any\] men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.

6: 

[[Gen.47.7|7]] And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

7: 

[[Gen.47.8|8]] And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old \[art\] thou?

8: 

[[Gen.47.9|9]] And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage \[are\] an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.

9: 

[[Gen.47.10|10]] And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.

10: 

[[Gen.47.11|11]] And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.

11: 

[[Gen.47.12|12]] And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father’s household, with bread, according to \[their\] families.
