[[Gen.27|Genesis 27:1 - Genesis 27:29]]
*Isaac Blesses Jacob*

[[Gen.27.1|1]] And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, \[here am\] I.

1: 

[[Gen.27.2|2]] And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:

2: 

[[Gen.27.3|3]] Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me \[some\] venison;

3: 

[[Gen.27.4|4]] And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring \[it\] to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.

4: 

[[Gen.27.5|5]] And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt \[for\] venison, \[and\] to bring \[it\].

5: 

[[Gen.27.6|6]] And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,

6: 

[[Gen.27.7|7]] Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death.

7: 

[[Gen.27.8|8]] Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.

8: 

[[Gen.27.9|9]] Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:

9: 

[[Gen.27.10|10]] And thou shalt bring \[it\] to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.

10: 

[[Gen.27.11|11]] And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother \[is\] a hairy man, and I \[am\] a smooth man:

11: 

[[Gen.27.12|12]] My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.

12: 

[[Gen.27.13|13]] And his mother said unto him, Upon me \[be\] thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me \[them\].

13: 

[[Gen.27.14|14]] And he went, and fetched, and brought \[them\] to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.

14: 

[[Gen.27.15|15]] And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which \[were\] with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:

15: 

[[Gen.27.16|16]] And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:

16: 

[[Gen.27.17|17]] And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.

17: 

[[Gen.27.18|18]] And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here \[am\] I; who \[art\] thou, my son?

18: 

[[Gen.27.19|19]] And Jacob said unto his father, I \[am\] Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.

19: 

[[Gen.27.20|20]] And Isaac said unto his son, How \[is it\] that thou hast found \[it\] so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought \[it\] to me.

20: 

[[Gen.27.21|21]] And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou \[be\] my very son Esau or not.

21: 

[[Gen.27.22|22]] And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice \[is\] Jacob’s voice, but the hands \[are\] the hands of Esau.

22: 

[[Gen.27.23|23]] And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him.

23: 

[[Gen.27.24|24]] And he said, \[Art\] thou my very son Esau? And he said, I \[am\].

24: 

[[Gen.27.25|25]] And he said, Bring \[it\] near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought \[it\] near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.

25: 

[[Gen.27.26|26]] And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.

26: 

[[Gen.27.27|27]] And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son \[is\] as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:

27: 

[[Gen.27.28|28]] Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:

28: 

[[Gen.27.29|29]] Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee: cursed \[be\] every one that curseth thee, and blessed \[be\] he that blesseth thee.

29:
