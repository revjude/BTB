[[Gen.21|Genesis 21:9 - Genesis 21:21]]
*Sarah Turns against Hagar*

[[Gen.21.9|9]] And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.

9: 

[[Gen.21.10|10]] Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, \[even\] with Isaac.

10: 

[[Gen.21.11|11]] And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of his son.

11: 

[[Gen.21.12|12]] And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.

12: 

[[Gen.21.13|13]] And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he \[is\] thy seed.

13: 

[[Gen.21.14|14]] And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave \[it\] unto Hagar, putting \[it\] on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.

14: 

[[Gen.21.15|15]] And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.

15: 

[[Gen.21.16|16]] And she went, and sat her down over against \[him\] a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against \[him\], and lift up her voice, and wept.

16: 

[[Gen.21.17|17]] And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he \[is\].

17: 

[[Gen.21.18|18]] Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.

18: 

[[Gen.21.19|19]] And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.

19: 

[[Gen.21.20|20]] And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.

20: 

[[Gen.21.21|21]] And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.

21:
