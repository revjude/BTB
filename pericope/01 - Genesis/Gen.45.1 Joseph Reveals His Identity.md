[[Gen.45|Genesis 45:1 - Genesis 45:8]]
*Joseph Reveals His Identity*

[[Gen.45.1|1]] Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.

1: 

[[Gen.45.2|2]] And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.

2: 

[[Gen.45.3|3]] And Joseph said unto his brethren, I \[am\] Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.

3: 

[[Gen.45.4|4]] And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I \[am\] Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.

4: 

[[Gen.45.5|5]] Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.

5: 

[[Gen.45.6|6]] For these two years \[hath\] the famine \[been\] in the land: and yet \[there are\] five years, in the which \[there shall\] neither \[be\] earing nor harvest.

6: 

[[Gen.45.7|7]] And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

7: 

[[Gen.45.8|8]] So now \[it was\] not you \[that\] sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.

8:
