[[Gen.41|Genesis 41:37 - Genesis 41:45]]
*Joseph Given Charge of Egypt*

[[Gen.41.37|37]] And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.

37: 

[[Gen.41.38|38]] And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find \[such a one\] as this \[is\], a man in whom the Spirit of God \[is\]?

38: 

[[Gen.41.39|39]] And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, \[there is\] none so discreet and wise as thou \[art\]:

39: 

[[Gen.41.40|40]] Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.

40: 

[[Gen.41.41|41]] And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.

41: 

[[Gen.41.42|42]] And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;

42: 

[[Gen.41.43|43]] And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him \[ruler\] over all the land of Egypt.

43: 

[[Gen.41.44|44]] And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I \[am\] Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.

44: 

[[Gen.41.45|45]] And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over \[all\] the land of Egypt.

45:
