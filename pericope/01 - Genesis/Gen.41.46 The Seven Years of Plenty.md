[[Gen.41|Genesis 41:46 - Genesis 41:52]]
*The Seven Years of Plenty*

[[Gen.41.46|46]] And Joseph \[was\] thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.

46: 

[[Gen.41.47|47]] And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.

47: 

[[Gen.41.48|48]] And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which \[was\] round about every city, laid he up in the same.

48: 

[[Gen.41.49|49]] And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for \[it was\] without number.

[[Gen.41.50|50]] And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.

[[Gen.41.51|51]] And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, \[said he\], hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.

51: 

[[Gen.41.52|52]] And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
