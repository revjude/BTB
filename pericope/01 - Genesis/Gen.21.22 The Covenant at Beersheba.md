[[Gen.21|Genesis 21:22 - Genesis 21:34]]
*The Covenant at Beersheba*

[[Gen.21.22|22]] And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God \[is\] with thee in all that thou doest:

22: 

[[Gen.21.23|23]] Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son: \[but\] according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.

23: 

[[Gen.21.24|24]] And Abraham said, I will swear.

24: 

[[Gen.21.25|25]] And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.

25: 

[[Gen.21.26|26]] And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I \[of it\], but to day.

26: 

[[Gen.21.27|27]] And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.

27: 

[[Gen.21.28|28]] And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

28: 

[[Gen.21.29|29]] And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What \[mean\] these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?

29: 

[[Gen.21.30|30]] And he said, For \[these\] seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.

30: 

[[Gen.21.31|31]] Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them.

31: 

[[Gen.21.32|32]] Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.

32: 

[[Gen.21.33|33]] And \[Abraham\] planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.

33: 

[[Gen.21.34|34]] And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines’ land many days.

34:
