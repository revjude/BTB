[[Gen.26|Genesis 26:6 - Genesis 26:11]]
*Isaac Deceives Abimelech*

[[Gen.26.6|6]] And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:

6: 

[[Gen.26.7|7]] And the men of the place asked \[him\] of his wife; and he said, She \[is\] my sister: for he feared to say, \[She is\] my wife; lest, \[said he\], the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she \[was\] fair to look upon.

7: 

[[Gen.26.8|8]] And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac \[was\] sporting with Rebekah his wife.

8: 

[[Gen.26.9|9]] And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she \[is\] thy wife: and how saidst thou, She \[is\] my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.

9: 

[[Gen.26.10|10]] And Abimelech said, What \[is\] this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.

10: 

[[Gen.26.11|11]] And Abimelech charged all \[his\] people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.

11:
