[[Gen.3|Genesis 3:8 - Genesis 3:13]]
*God Arraigns Adam and Eve*

[[Gen.3.8|8]] And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.

8: 

[[Gen.3.9|9]] And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where \[art\] thou?

9: 

[[Gen.3.10|10]] And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I \[was\] naked; and I hid myself.

10: 

[[Gen.3.11|11]] And he said, Who told thee that thou \[wast\] naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?

11: 

[[Gen.3.12|12]] And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest \[to be\] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.

12: 

[[Gen.3.13|13]] And the LORD God said unto the woman, What \[is\] this \[that\] thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.

13:
