[[Gen.24|Genesis 24:1 - Genesis 24:14]]
*A Wife for Isaac*

[[Gen.24.1|1]] And Abraham was old, \[and\] well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.

1: 

[[Gen.24.2|2]] And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:

2: 

[[Gen.24.3|3]] And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:

3: 

[[Gen.24.4|4]] But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.

4: 

[[Gen.24.5|5]] And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?

5: 

[[Gen.24.6|6]] And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.

6: 

[[Gen.24.7|7]] The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.

7: 

[[Gen.24.8|8]] And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.

8: 

[[Gen.24.9|9]] And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.

9: 

[[Gen.24.10|10]] And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master \[were\] in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.

10: 

[[Gen.24.11|11]] And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, \[even\] the time that women go out to draw \[water\].

11: 

[[Gen.24.12|12]] And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.

12: 

[[Gen.24.13|13]] Behold, I stand \[here\] by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:

13: 

[[Gen.24.14|14]] And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: \[let the same be\] she \[that\] thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.

14:
