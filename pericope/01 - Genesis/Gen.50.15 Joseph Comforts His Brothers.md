[[Gen.50|Genesis 50:15 - Genesis 50:21]]
*Joseph Comforts His Brothers*

[[Gen.50.15|15]] And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.

15: 

[[Gen.50.16|16]] And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,

16: 

[[Gen.50.17|17]] So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.

17: 

[[Gen.50.18|18]] And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we \[be\] thy servants.

18: 

[[Gen.50.19|19]] And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for \[am\] I in the place of God?

19: 

[[Gen.50.20|20]] But as for you, ye thought evil against me; \[but\] God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as \[it is\] this day, to save much people alive.

20: 

[[Gen.50.21|21]] Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.

21:
