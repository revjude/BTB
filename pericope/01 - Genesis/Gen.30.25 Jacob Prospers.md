[[Gen.30|Genesis 30:25 - Genesis 30:43]]
*Jacob Prospers*

[[Gen.30.25|25]] And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.

25: 

[[Gen.30.26|26]] Give \[me\] my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.

26: 

[[Gen.30.27|27]] And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, \[tarry: for\] I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.

27: 

[[Gen.30.28|28]] And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give \[it\].

28: 

[[Gen.30.29|29]] And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.

29: 

[[Gen.30.30|30]] For \[it was\] little which thou hadst before I \[came\], and it is \[now\] increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?

30: 

[[Gen.30.31|31]] And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed \[and\] keep thy flock:

31: 

[[Gen.30.32|32]] I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and \[of such\] shall be my hire.

32: 

[[Gen.30.33|33]] So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that \[is\] not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.

33: 

[[Gen.30.34|34]] And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.

34: 

[[Gen.30.35|35]] And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, \[and\] every one that had \[some\] white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave \[them\] into the hand of his sons.

35: 

[[Gen.30.36|36]] And he set three days’ journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.

36: 

[[Gen.30.37|37]] And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which \[was\] in the rods.

37: 

[[Gen.30.38|38]] And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.

38: 

[[Gen.30.39|39]] And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.

39: 

[[Gen.30.40|40]] And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban’s cattle.

40: 

[[Gen.30.41|41]] And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.

41: 

[[Gen.30.42|42]] But when the cattle were feeble, he put \[them\] not in: so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.

42: 

[[Gen.30.43|43]] And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.

43:
