[[Gen.3|Genesis 3:16 - Genesis 3:20]]
*The Punishment of Mankind*

[[Gen.3.16|16]] Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire \[shall be\] to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.

16: 

[[Gen.3.17|17]] And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed \[is\] the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat \[of\] it all the days of thy life;

17: 

[[Gen.3.18|18]] Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;

18: 

[[Gen.3.19|19]] In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou \[art\], and unto dust shalt thou return.

19: 

[[Gen.3.20|20]] And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.

20:
