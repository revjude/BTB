[[Gen.43|Genesis 43:16 - Genesis 43:34]]
*Joseph’s Hospitality to His Brothers*

[[Gen.43.16|16]] And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring \[these\] men home, and slay, and make ready; for \[these\] men shall dine with me at noon.

16: 

[[Gen.43.17|17]] And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house.

17: 

[[Gen.43.18|18]] And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.

18: 

[[Gen.43.19|19]] And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,

19: 

[[Gen.43.20|20]] And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:

20: 

[[Gen.43.21|21]] And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, \[every\] man’s money \[was\] in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.

21: 

[[Gen.43.22|22]] And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.

22: 

[[Gen.43.23|23]] And he said, Peace \[be\] to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.

23: 

[[Gen.43.24|24]] And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave \[them\] water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.

24: 

[[Gen.43.25|25]] And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.

25: 

[[Gen.43.26|26]] And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which \[was\] in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.

26: 

[[Gen.43.27|27]] And he asked them of \[their\] welfare, and said, \[Is\] your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? \[Is\] he yet alive?

27: 

[[Gen.43.28|28]] And they answered, Thy servant our father \[is\] in good health, he \[is\] yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.

28: 

[[Gen.43.29|29]] And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said, \[Is\] this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.

29: 

[[Gen.43.30|30]] And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought \[where\] to weep; and he entered into \[his\] chamber, and wept there.

30: 

[[Gen.43.31|31]] And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.

31: 

[[Gen.43.32|32]] And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that \[is\] an abomination unto the Egyptians.

32: 

[[Gen.43.33|33]] And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.

33: 

[[Gen.43.34|34]] And he took \[and sent\] messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin’s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.

34:
