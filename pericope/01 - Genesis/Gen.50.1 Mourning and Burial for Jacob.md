[[Gen.50|Genesis 50:1 - Genesis 50:14]]
*Mourning and Burial for Jacob*

[[Gen.50.1|1]] And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.

1: 

[[Gen.50.2|2]] And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.

2: 

[[Gen.50.3|3]] And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.

3: 

[[Gen.50.4|4]] And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,

4: 

[[Gen.50.5|5]] My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.

5: 

[[Gen.50.6|6]] And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.

6: 

[[Gen.50.7|7]] And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,

7: 

[[Gen.50.8|8]] And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.

8: 

[[Gen.50.9|9]] And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.

9: 

[[Gen.50.10|10]] And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which \[is\] beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.

10: 

[[Gen.50.11|11]] And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This \[is\] a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which \[is\] beyond Jordan.

11: 

[[Gen.50.12|12]] And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:

12: 

[[Gen.50.13|13]] For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.

13: 

[[Gen.50.14|14]] And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.

14:
