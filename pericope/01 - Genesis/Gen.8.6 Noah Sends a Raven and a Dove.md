[[Gen.8|Genesis 8:6 - Genesis 8:12]]
*Noah Sends a Raven and a Dove*

[[Gen.8.6|6]] And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:

6: 

[[Gen.8.7|7]] And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.

7: 

[[Gen.8.8|8]] Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;

8: 

[[Gen.8.9|9]] But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters \[were\] on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.

9: 

[[Gen.8.10|10]] And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;

10: 

[[Gen.8.11|11]] And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth \[was\] an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.

11: 

[[Gen.8.12|12]] And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.

12:
