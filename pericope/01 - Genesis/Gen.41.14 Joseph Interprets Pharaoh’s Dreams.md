[[Gen.41|Genesis 41:14 - Genesis 41:36]]
*Joseph Interprets Pharaoh’s Dreams*

[[Gen.41.14|14]] Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved \[himself\], and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.

14: 

[[Gen.41.15|15]] And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and \[there is\] none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, \[that\] thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.

15: 

[[Gen.41.16|16]] And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, \[It is\] not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

16: 

[[Gen.41.17|17]] And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:

17: 

[[Gen.41.18|18]] And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:

18: 

[[Gen.41.19|19]] And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:

19: 

[[Gen.41.20|20]] And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:

20: 

[[Gen.41.21|21]] And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they \[were\] still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.

21: 

[[Gen.41.22|22]] And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:

22: 

[[Gen.41.23|23]] And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, \[and\] blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:

23: 

[[Gen.41.24|24]] And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told \[this\] unto the magicians; but \[there was\] none that could declare \[it\] to me.

24: 

[[Gen.41.25|25]] And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh \[is\] one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he \[is\] about to do.

25: 

[[Gen.41.26|26]] The seven good kine \[are\] seven years; and the seven good ears \[are\] seven years: the dream \[is\] one.

26: 

[[Gen.41.27|27]] And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them \[are\] seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.

27: 

[[Gen.41.28|28]] This \[is\] the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God \[is\] about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.

28: 

[[Gen.41.29|29]] Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:

29: 

[[Gen.41.30|30]] And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;

30: 

[[Gen.41.31|31]] And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it \[shall be\] very grievous.

31: 

[[Gen.41.32|32]] And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; \[it is\] because the thing \[is\] established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.

32: 

[[Gen.41.33|33]] Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.

33: 

[[Gen.41.34|34]] Let Pharaoh do \[this\], and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.

34: 

[[Gen.41.35|35]] And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.

35: 

[[Gen.41.36|36]] And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.

36:
