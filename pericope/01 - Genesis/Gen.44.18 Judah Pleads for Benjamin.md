[[Gen.44|Genesis 44:18 - Genesis 44:34]]
*Judah Pleads for Benjamin*

[[Gen.44.18|18]] Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou \[art\] even as Pharaoh.

18: 

[[Gen.44.19|19]] My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?

19: 

[[Gen.44.20|20]] And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.

20: 

[[Gen.44.21|21]] And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.

21: 

[[Gen.44.22|22]] And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for \[if\] he should leave his father, \[his father\] would die.

22: 

[[Gen.44.23|23]] And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.

23: 

[[Gen.44.24|24]] And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.

24: 

[[Gen.44.25|25]] And our father said, Go again, \[and\] buy us a little food.

25: 

[[Gen.44.26|26]] And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother \[be\] with us.

26: 

[[Gen.44.27|27]] And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two \[sons\]:

27: 

[[Gen.44.28|28]] And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:

28: 

[[Gen.44.29|29]] And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

29: 

[[Gen.44.30|30]] Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad \[be\] not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life;

30: 

[[Gen.44.31|31]] It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad \[is\] not \[with us\], that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.

31: 

[[Gen.44.32|32]] For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.

32: 

[[Gen.44.33|33]] Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.

33: 

[[Gen.44.34|34]] For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad \[be\] not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.
