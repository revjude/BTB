[[Gen.50.22|22]] And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.

[[Gen.50.23|23]] And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third \[generation\]: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph’s knees.

[[Gen.50.24|24]] And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
