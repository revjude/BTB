[[Gen.22|Genesis 22:1 - Genesis 22:10]]
*The Offering of Isaac*

[[Gen.22.1|1]] And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, \[here\] I \[am\].

1: 

[[Gen.22.2|2]] And he said, Take now thy son, thine only \[son\] Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.

2: 

[[Gen.22.3|3]] And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.

3: 

[[Gen.22.4|4]] Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.

4: 

[[Gen.22.5|5]] And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.

5: 

[[Gen.22.6|6]] And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid \[it\] upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.

6: 

[[Gen.22.7|7]] And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here \[am\] I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where \[is\] the lamb for a burnt offering?

7: 

[[Gen.22.8|8]] And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.

8: 

[[Gen.22.9|9]] And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

9: 

[[Gen.22.10|10]] And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.

10:
