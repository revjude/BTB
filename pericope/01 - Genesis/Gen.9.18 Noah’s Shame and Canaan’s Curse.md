[[Gen.9|Genesis 9:18 - Genesis 9:25]]
*Noah’s Shame and Canaan’s Curse*

[[Gen.9.18|18]] And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham \[is\] the father of Canaan.

18: 

[[Gen.9.19|19]] These \[are\] the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.

19: 

[[Gen.9.20|20]] And Noah began \[to be\] an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:

20: 

[[Gen.9.21|21]] And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.

21: 

[[Gen.9.22|22]] And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.

22: 

[[Gen.9.23|23]] And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid \[it\] upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces \[were\] backward, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.

23: 

[[Gen.9.24|24]] And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.

24: 

[[Gen.9.25|25]] And he said, Cursed \[be\] Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.

25:
