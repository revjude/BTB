[[Gen.3|Genesis 3:14 - Genesis 3:15]]
*The Fate of the Serpent*

[[Gen.3.14|14]] And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou \[art\] cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:

14: 

[[Gen.3.15|15]] And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.

15:
