[[Gen.12|Genesis 12:1 - Genesis 12:9]]
*The Call of Abram*

[[Gen.12.1|1]] Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will shew thee:

1: 

[[Gen.12.2|2]] And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:

2: 

[[Gen.12.3|3]] And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.

3: 

[[Gen.12.4|4]] So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram \[was\] seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.

4: 

[[Gen.12.5|5]] And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.

5: 

[[Gen.12.6|6]] And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite \[was\] then in the land.

6: 

[[Gen.12.7|7]] And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.

7: 

[[Gen.12.8|8]] And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, \[having\] Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.

8: 

[[Gen.12.9|9]] And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.
