[[Gen.26|Genesis 26:26 - Genesis 26:33]]
*Isaac’s Covenant with Abimelech*

[[Gen.26.26|26]] Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.

26: 

[[Gen.26.27|27]] And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?

27: 

[[Gen.26.28|28]] And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, \[even\] betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;

28: 

[[Gen.26.29|29]] That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou \[art\] now the blessed of the LORD.

29: 

[[Gen.26.30|30]] And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.

30: 

[[Gen.26.31|31]] And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.

31: 

[[Gen.26.32|32]] And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.

32: 

[[Gen.26.33|33]] And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city \[is\] Beersheba unto this day.

33:
