[[Gen.45|Genesis 45:9 - Genesis 45:15]]
*Joseph Sends for His Father*

[[Gen.45.9|9]] Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:

9: 

[[Gen.45.10|10]] And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children’s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:

10: 

[[Gen.45.11|11]] And there will I nourish thee; for yet \[there are\] five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.

11: 

[[Gen.45.12|12]] And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that \[it is\] my mouth that speaketh unto you.

12: 

[[Gen.45.13|13]] And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.

13: 

[[Gen.45.14|14]] And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.

14: 

[[Gen.45.15|15]] Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.

15:
