[[Gen.31|Genesis 31:1 - Genesis 31:21]]
*Jacob Flees from Laban*

[[Gen.31.1|1]] And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that \[was\] our father’s; and of \[that\] which \[was\] our father’s hath he gotten all this glory.

1: 

[[Gen.31.2|2]] And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it \[was\] not toward him as before.

2: 

[[Gen.31.3|3]] And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.

3: 

[[Gen.31.4|4]] And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,

4: 

[[Gen.31.5|5]] And said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that it \[is\] not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.

5: 

[[Gen.31.6|6]] And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.

6: 

[[Gen.31.7|7]] And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.

7: 

[[Gen.31.8|8]] If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.

8: 

[[Gen.31.9|9]] Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given \[them\] to me.

9: 

[[Gen.31.10|10]] And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle \[were\] ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.

10: 

[[Gen.31.11|11]] And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, \[saying\], Jacob: And I said, Here \[am\] I.

11: 

[[Gen.31.12|12]] And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle \[are\] ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.

12: 

[[Gen.31.13|13]] I \[am\] the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, \[and\] where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.

13: 

[[Gen.31.14|14]] And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, \[Is there\] yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?

14: 

[[Gen.31.15|15]] Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.

15: 

[[Gen.31.16|16]] For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that \[is\] ours, and our children’s: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.

16: 

[[Gen.31.17|17]] Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;

17: 

[[Gen.31.18|18]] And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.

18: 

[[Gen.31.19|19]] And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that \[were\] her father’s.

19: 

[[Gen.31.20|20]] And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.

20: 

[[Gen.31.21|21]] So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face \[toward\] the mount Gilead.

21:
