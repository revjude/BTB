[[Gen.13|Genesis 13:10 - Genesis 13:13]]
*Lot Proceeds toward Sodom*

[[Gen.13.10|10]] And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it \[was\] well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, \[even\] as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.

10: 

[[Gen.13.11|11]] Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.

11: 

[[Gen.13.12|12]] Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched \[his\] tent toward Sodom.

12: 

[[Gen.13.13|13]] But the men of Sodom \[were\] wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.

13:
