[[Gen.14|Genesis 14:10 - Genesis 14:16]]
*Abram Rescues Lot*

[[Gen.14.10|10]] And the vale of Siddim \[was full of\] slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.

10: 

[[Gen.14.11|11]] And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.

11: 

[[Gen.14.12|12]] And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.

12: 

[[Gen.14.13|13]] And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these \[were\] confederate with Abram.

13: 

[[Gen.14.14|14]] And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained \[servants\], born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued \[them\] unto Dan.

14: 

[[Gen.14.15|15]] And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which \[is\] on the left hand of Damascus.

15: 

[[Gen.14.16|16]] And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.

16:
