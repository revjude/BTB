[[Gen.46|Genesis 46:28 - Genesis 46:34]]
*Jacob Arrives in Egypt*

[[Gen.46.28|28]] And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.

28: 

[[Gen.46.29|29]] And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

29: 

[[Gen.46.30|30]] And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou \[art\] yet alive.

30: 

[[Gen.46.31|31]] And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father’s house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father’s house, which \[were\] in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;

31: 

[[Gen.46.32|32]] And the men \[are\] shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.

32: 

[[Gen.46.33|33]] And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What \[is\] your occupation?

33: 

[[Gen.46.34|34]] That ye shall say, Thy servants’ trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, \[and\] also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd \[is\] an abomination unto the Egyptians.

34:
