[[Gen.1|Genesis 1:14 - Genesis 1:19]]
*The Fourth Day*

[[Gen.1.14|14]] And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:

14: 

[[Gen.1.15|15]] And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.

15: 

[[Gen.1.16|16]] And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: \[he made\] the stars also.

16: 

[[Gen.1.17|17]] And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,

17: 

[[Gen.1.18|18]] And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that \[it was\] good.

18: 

[[Gen.1.19|19]] And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

19:
