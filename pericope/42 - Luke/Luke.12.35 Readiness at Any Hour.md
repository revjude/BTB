[[Luke.12|Luke 12:35 - Luke 12:48]]
*Readiness at Any Hour*

[[Luke.12.35|35]] Let your loins be girded about, and \[your\] lights burning;

35: 

[[Luke.12.36|36]] And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.

36: 

[[Luke.12.37|37]] Blessed \[are\] those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.

37: 

[[Luke.12.38|38]] And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find \[them\] so, blessed are those servants.

38: 

[[Luke.12.39|39]] And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.

39: 

[[Luke.12.40|40]] Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.

40: 

[[Luke.12.41|41]] Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?

41: 

[[Luke.12.42|42]] And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom \[his\] lord shall make ruler over his household, to give \[them their\] portion of meat in due season?

42: 

[[Luke.12.43|43]] Blessed \[is\] that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.

43: 

[[Luke.12.44|44]] Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.

44: 

[[Luke.12.45|45]] But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;

45: 

[[Luke.12.46|46]] The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for \[him\], and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.

46: 

[[Luke.12.47|47]] And that servant, which knew his lord’s will, and prepared not \[himself\], neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many \[stripes\].

47: 

[[Luke.12.48|48]] But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few \[stripes\]. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.

48:
