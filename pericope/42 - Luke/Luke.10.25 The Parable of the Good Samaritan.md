[[Luke.10|Luke 10:25 - Luke 10:37]]
*The Parable of the Good Samaritan*

[[Luke.10.25|25]] And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

25: 

[[Luke.10.26|26]] He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?

26: 

[[Luke.10.27|27]] And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.

27: 

[[Luke.10.28|28]] And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.

28: 

[[Luke.10.29|29]] But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?

29: 

[[Luke.10.30|30]] And Jesus answering said, A certain \[man\] went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded \[him\], and departed, leaving \[him\] half dead.

30: 

[[Luke.10.31|31]] And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.

31: 

[[Luke.10.32|32]] And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked \[on him\], and passed by on the other side.

32: 

[[Luke.10.33|33]] But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion \[on him\],

33: 

[[Luke.10.34|34]] And went to \[him\], and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.

34: 

[[Luke.10.35|35]] And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave \[them\] to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.

35: 

[[Luke.10.36|36]] Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?

36: 

[[Luke.10.37|37]] And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.

37:
