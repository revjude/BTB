[[Luke.9|Luke 9:28 - Luke 9:36]]
*The Transfiguration*

[[Luke.9.28|28]] And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.

28: 

[[Luke.9.29|29]] And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment \[was\] white \[and\] glistering.

29: 

[[Luke.9.30|30]] And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:

30: 

[[Luke.9.31|31]] Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.

31: 

[[Luke.9.32|32]] But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.

32: 

[[Luke.9.33|33]] And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.

33: 

[[Luke.9.34|34]] While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.

34: 

[[Luke.9.35|35]] And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.

35: 

[[Luke.9.36|36]] And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept \[it\] close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.

36:
