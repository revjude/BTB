[[Luke.23|Luke 23:50 - Luke 23:56]]
*The Burial of Jesus*

[[Luke.23.50|50]] And, behold, \[there was\] a man named Joseph, a counseller; \[and he was\] a good man, and a just:

50: 

[[Luke.23.51|51]] (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) \[he was\] of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.

51: 

[[Luke.23.52|52]] This \[man\] went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.

52: 

[[Luke.23.53|53]] And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.

53: 

[[Luke.23.54|54]] And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.

54: 

[[Luke.23.55|55]] And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.

55: 

[[Luke.23.56|56]] And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.

56:
