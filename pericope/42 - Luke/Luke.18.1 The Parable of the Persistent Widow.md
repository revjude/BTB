[[Luke.18|Luke 18:1 - Luke 18:8]]
*The Parable of the Persistent Widow*

[[Luke.18.1|1]] And he spake a parable unto them \[to this end\], that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;

1: 

[[Luke.18.2|2]] Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:

2: 

[[Luke.18.3|3]] And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.

3: 

[[Luke.18.4|4]] And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;

4: 

[[Luke.18.5|5]] Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.

5: 

[[Luke.18.6|6]] And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.

6: 

[[Luke.18.7|7]] And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?

7: 

[[Luke.18.8|8]] I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?

8:
