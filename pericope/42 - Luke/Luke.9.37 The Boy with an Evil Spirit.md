[[Luke.9|Luke 9:37 - Luke 9:42]]
*The Boy with an Evil Spirit*

[[Luke.9.37|37]] And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.

37: 

[[Luke.9.38|38]] And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.

38: 

[[Luke.9.39|39]] And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.

39: 

[[Luke.9.40|40]] And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.

40: 

[[Luke.9.41|41]] And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.

41: 

[[Luke.9.42|42]] And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare \[him\]. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.

42:
