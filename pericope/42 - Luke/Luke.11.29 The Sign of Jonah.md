[[Luke.11|Luke 11:29 - Luke 11:32]]
*The Sign of Jonah*

[[Luke.11.29|29]] And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.

29: 

[[Luke.11.30|30]] For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.

30: 

[[Luke.11.31|31]] The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon \[is\] here.

31: 

[[Luke.11.32|32]] The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas \[is\] here.

32:
