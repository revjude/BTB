[[Luke.20|Luke 20:1 - Luke 20:8]]
*Jesus’ Authority Challenged*

1: 

[[Luke.20.2|2]] And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?

2: 

[[Luke.20.3|3]] And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:

7: 

[[Luke.20.8|8]] And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.

8:
