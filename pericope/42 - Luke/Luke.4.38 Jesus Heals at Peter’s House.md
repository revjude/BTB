[[Luke.4|Luke 4:38 - Luke 4:41]]
*Jesus Heals at Peter’s House*

[[Luke.4.38|38]] And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s house. And Simon’s wife’s mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her.

38: 

[[Luke.4.39|39]] And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.

39: 

[[Luke.4.40|40]] Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.
