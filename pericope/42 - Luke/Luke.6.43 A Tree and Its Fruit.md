[[Luke.6|Luke 6:43 - Luke 6:45]]
*A Tree and Its Fruit*

[[Luke.6.43|43]] For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

43: 

[[Luke.6.44|44]] For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.

44: 

[[Luke.6.45|45]] A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.

45:
