[[Luke.6|Luke 6:37 - Luke 6:42]]
*Judging Others*

[[Luke.6.37|37]] Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:

37: 

[[Luke.6.38|38]] Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.

38: 

[[Luke.6.39|39]] And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?

39: 

[[Luke.6.40|40]] The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.

40: 

[[Luke.6.41|41]] And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

41: 

[[Luke.6.42|42]] Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother’s eye.

42:
