[[Luke.10|Luke 10:13 - Luke 10:16]]
*Woe to the Unrepentant*

[[Luke.10.13|13]] Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.

13: 

[[Luke.10.14|14]] But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.

14: 

[[Luke.10.15|15]] And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell.

15: 

[[Luke.10.16|16]] He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.

16:
