[[Luke.16|Luke 16:19 - Luke 16:31]]
*The Rich Man and Lazarus*

[[Luke.16.19|19]] There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:

19: 

[[Luke.16.20|20]] And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,

20: 

[[Luke.16.21|21]] And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.

21: 

[[Luke.16.22|22]] And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;

22: 

[[Luke.16.23|23]] And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.

23: 

[[Luke.16.24|24]] And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.

24: 

[[Luke.16.25|25]] But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.

25: 

[[Luke.16.26|26]] And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that \[would come\] from thence.

26: 

[[Luke.16.27|27]] Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house:

27: 

[[Luke.16.28|28]] For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.

28: 

[[Luke.16.29|29]] Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.

29: 

[[Luke.16.30|30]] And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.

30: 

[[Luke.16.31|31]] And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.

31:
