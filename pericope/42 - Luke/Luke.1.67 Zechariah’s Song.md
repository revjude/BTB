[[Luke.1|Luke 1:67 - Luke 1:80]]
*Zechariah’s Song*

[[Luke.1.67|67]] And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,

67: 

[[Luke.1.68|68]] Blessed \[be\] the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,

68: 

[[Luke.1.69|69]] And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;

69: 

[[Luke.1.70|70]] As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:

70: 

[[Luke.1.71|71]] That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;

71: 

[[Luke.1.72|72]] To perform the mercy \[promised\] to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;

72: 

[[Luke.1.73|73]] The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,

73: 

[[Luke.1.74|74]] That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,

74: 

[[Luke.1.75|75]] In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.

75: 

[[Luke.1.76|76]] And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;

76: 

[[Luke.1.77|77]] To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,

77: 

[[Luke.1.78|78]] Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,

78: 

[[Luke.1.79|79]] To give light to them that sit in darkness and \[in\] the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.

79: 

[[Luke.1.80|80]] And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.

80:
