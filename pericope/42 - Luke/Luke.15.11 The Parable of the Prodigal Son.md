[[Luke.15|Luke 15:11 - Luke 15:32]]
*The Parable of the Prodigal Son*

[[Luke.15.11|11]] And he said, A certain man had two sons:

11: 

[[Luke.15.12|12]] And the younger of them said to \[his\] father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth \[to me\]. And he divided unto them \[his\] living.

12: 

[[Luke.15.13|13]] And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.

13: 

[[Luke.15.14|14]] And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.

14: 

[[Luke.15.15|15]] And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.

15: 

[[Luke.15.16|16]] And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.

16: 

[[Luke.15.17|17]] And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!

17: 

[[Luke.15.18|18]] I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,

18: 

[[Luke.15.19|19]] And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.

19: 

[[Luke.15.20|20]] And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.

20: 

[[Luke.15.21|21]] And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.

21: 

[[Luke.15.22|22]] But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put \[it\] on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on \[his\] feet:

22: 

[[Luke.15.23|23]] And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill \[it\]; and let us eat, and be merry:

23: 

[[Luke.15.24|24]] For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.

24: 

[[Luke.15.25|25]] Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.

25: 

[[Luke.15.26|26]] And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.

26: 

[[Luke.15.27|27]] And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.

27: 

[[Luke.15.28|28]] And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.

28: 

[[Luke.15.29|29]] And he answering said to \[his\] father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:

29: 

[[Luke.15.30|30]] But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.

30: 

[[Luke.15.31|31]] And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.

31: 

[[Luke.15.32|32]] It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.

32:
