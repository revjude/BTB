[[Luke.14|Luke 14:7 - Luke 14:14]]
*The Parable of the Guests*

[[Luke.14.7|7]] And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them,

7: 

[[Luke.14.8|8]] When thou art bidden of any \[man\] to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;

8: 

[[Luke.14.9|9]] And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.

9: 

[[Luke.14.10|10]] But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee.

10: 

[[Luke.14.11|11]] For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

11: 

[[Luke.14.12|12]] Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor \[thy\] rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.

12: 

[[Luke.14.13|13]] But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:

13: 

[[Luke.14.14|14]] And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.

14:
