[[Luke.19|Luke 19:1 - Luke 19:10]]
*Jesus and Zacchaeus*

[[Luke.19.1|1]] And \[Jesus\] entered and passed through Jericho.

1: 

[[Luke.19.2|2]] And, behold, \[there was\] a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.

2: 

[[Luke.19.3|3]] And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.

3: 

[[Luke.19.4|4]] And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that \[way\].

4: 

[[Luke.19.5|5]] And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.

5: 

[[Luke.19.6|6]] And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.

6: 

[[Luke.19.7|7]] And when they saw \[it\], they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.

7: 

[[Luke.19.8|8]] And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore \[him\] fourfold.

8: 

[[Luke.19.9|9]] And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.

9: 

[[Luke.19.10|10]] For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.

10:
