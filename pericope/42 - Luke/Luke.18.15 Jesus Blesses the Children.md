[[Luke.18|Luke 18:15 - Luke 18:17]]
*Jesus Blesses the Children*

[[Luke.18.15|15]] And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when \[his\] disciples saw \[it\], they rebuked them.

15: 

[[Luke.18.16|16]] But Jesus called them \[unto him\], and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.

16: 

[[Luke.18.17|17]] Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.

17:
