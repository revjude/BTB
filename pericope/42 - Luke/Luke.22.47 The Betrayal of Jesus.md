[[Luke.22|Luke 22:47 - Luke 22:53]]
*The Betrayal of Jesus*

[[Luke.22.47|47]] And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.

47: 

[[Luke.22.48|48]] But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?

48: 

[[Luke.22.49|49]] When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?

49: 

[[Luke.22.50|50]] And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.

50: 

[[Luke.22.51|51]] And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.

51: 

[[Luke.22.52|52]] Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?

52: 

[[Luke.22.53|53]] When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.

53:
