[[Luke.2|Luke 2:25 - Luke 2:35]]
*The Prophecy of Simeon*

[[Luke.2.25|25]] And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name \[was\] Simeon; and the same man \[was\] just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.

25: 

[[Luke.2.26|26]] And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.

26: 

[[Luke.2.27|27]] And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,

27: 

[[Luke.2.28|28]] Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,

28: 

[[Luke.2.29|29]] Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:

29: 

[[Luke.2.30|30]] For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,

30: 

[[Luke.2.31|31]] Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;

31: 

[[Luke.2.32|32]] A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.

32: 

[[Luke.2.33|33]] And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.

33: 

[[Luke.2.34|34]] And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this \[child\] is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;

34: 

[[Luke.2.35|35]] (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.

35:
