*Jesus before the Sanhedrin*

[[Luke.22.66|66]] And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,

66: 

[[Luke.22.67|67]] Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:

[[Luke.22.68|68]] And if I also ask \[you\], ye will not answer me, nor let \[me\] go.
