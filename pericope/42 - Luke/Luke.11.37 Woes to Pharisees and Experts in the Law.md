[[Luke.11|Luke 11:37 - Luke 11:54]]
*Woes to Pharisees and Experts in the Law*

[[Luke.11.37|37]] And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.

37: 

[[Luke.11.38|38]] And when the Pharisee saw \[it\], he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.

38: 

[[Luke.11.39|39]] And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.

39: 

[[Luke.11.40|40]] \[Ye\] fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?

40: 

[[Luke.11.41|41]] But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.

41: 

[[Luke.11.42|42]] But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.

42: 

[[Luke.11.43|43]] Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.

43: 

[[Luke.11.44|44]] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over \[them\] are not aware \[of them\].

44: 

[[Luke.11.45|45]] Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.

45: 

[[Luke.11.46|46]] And he said, Woe unto you also, \[ye\] lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.

46: 

[[Luke.11.47|47]] Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.

47: 

[[Luke.11.48|48]] Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.

48: 

[[Luke.11.49|49]] Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and \[some\] of them they shall slay and persecute:

49: 

[[Luke.11.50|50]] That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;

50: 

[[Luke.11.51|51]] From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.

51: 

[[Luke.11.52|52]] Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.

52: 

[[Luke.11.53|53]] And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge \[him\] vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:

53: 

[[Luke.11.54|54]] Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.

54:
