[[Luke.12|Luke 12:8 - Luke 12:12]]
*Confessing Christ*

[[Luke.12.8|8]] Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:

8: 

[[Luke.12.9|9]] But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.

9: 

[[Luke.12.10|10]] And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.

10: 

[[Luke.12.11|11]] And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and \[unto\] magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:

11: 

[[Luke.12.12|12]] For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.

12:
