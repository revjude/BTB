[[Luke.18|Luke 18:35 - Luke 18:43]]
*Jesus Heals a Blind Beggar*

[[Luke.18.35|35]] And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:

35: 

[[Luke.18.36|36]] And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.

36: 

[[Luke.18.37|37]] And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.

37: 

[[Luke.18.38|38]] And he cried, saying, Jesus, \[thou\] Son of David, have mercy on me.

38: 

[[Luke.18.39|39]] And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, \[Thou\] Son of David, have mercy on me.

39: 

[[Luke.18.40|40]] And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,

40: 

[[Luke.18.41|41]] Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.

41: 

[[Luke.18.42|42]] And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.

42: 

[[Luke.18.43|43]] And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw \[it\], gave praise unto God.

43:
