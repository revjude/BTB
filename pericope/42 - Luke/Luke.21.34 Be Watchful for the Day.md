[[Luke.21|Luke 21:34 - Luke 21:38]]
*Be Watchful for the Day*

[[Luke.21.34|34]] And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and \[so\] that day come upon you unawares.

34: 

[[Luke.21.35|35]] For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.

35: 

[[Luke.21.36|36]] Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.

36: 

[[Luke.21.37|37]] And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called \[the mount\] of Olives.

37: 

[[Luke.21.38|38]] And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.

38:
