[[Luke.16|Luke 16:1 - Luke 16:13]]
*The Parable of the Shrewd Manager*

[[Luke.16.1|1]] And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.

1: 

[[Luke.16.2|2]] And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.

2: 

[[Luke.16.3|3]] Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.

3: 

[[Luke.16.4|4]] I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.

4: 

[[Luke.16.5|5]] So he called every one of his lord’s debtors \[unto him\], and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?

5: 

[[Luke.16.6|6]] And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.

6: 

[[Luke.16.7|7]] Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.

7: 

[[Luke.16.8|8]] And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.

8: 

[[Luke.16.9|9]] And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.

9: 

[[Luke.16.10|10]] He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.

10: 

[[Luke.16.11|11]] If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true \[riches\]?

11: 

[[Luke.16.12|12]] And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that which is your own?

12: 

[[Luke.16.13|13]] No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

13:
