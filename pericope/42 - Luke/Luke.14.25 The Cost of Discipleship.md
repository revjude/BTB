[[Luke.14|Luke 14:25 - Luke 14:33]]
*The Cost of Discipleship*

[[Luke.14.25|25]] And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them,

25: 

[[Luke.14.26|26]] If any \[man\] come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.

26: 

[[Luke.14.27|27]] And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.

27: 

[[Luke.14.28|28]] For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have \[sufficient\] to finish \[it\]?

28: 

[[Luke.14.29|29]] Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish \[it\], all that behold \[it\] begin to mock him,

29: 

[[Luke.14.30|30]] Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.

30: 

[[Luke.14.31|31]] Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?

31: 

[[Luke.14.32|32]] Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.

32: 

[[Luke.14.33|33]] So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.

33:
