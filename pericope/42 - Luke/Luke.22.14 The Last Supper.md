[[Luke.22|Luke 22:14 - Luke 22:23]]
*The Last Supper*

[[Luke.22.14|14]] And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.

14: 

[[Luke.22.15|15]] And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:

15: 

[[Luke.22.16|16]] For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

16: 

[[Luke.22.17|17]] And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide \[it\] among yourselves:

17: 

[[Luke.22.18|18]] For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.

18: 

[[Luke.22.19|19]] And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake \[it\], and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.

19: 

[[Luke.22.20|20]] Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup \[is\] the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.

20: 

[[Luke.22.21|21]] But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me \[is\] with me on the table.

21: 

[[Luke.22.22|22]] And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!

22: 

[[Luke.22.23|23]] And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.

23:
