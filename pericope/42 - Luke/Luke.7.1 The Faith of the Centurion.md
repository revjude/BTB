[[Luke.7|Luke 7:1 - Luke 7:10]]
*The Faith of the Centurion*

[[Luke.7.1|1]] Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.

1: 

[[Luke.7.2|2]] And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.

2: 

[[Luke.7.3|3]] And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.

3: 

[[Luke.7.4|4]] And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:

4: 

[[Luke.7.5|5]] For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.

5: 

[[Luke.7.6|6]] Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:

6: 

[[Luke.7.7|7]] Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.

7: 

[[Luke.7.8|8]] For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth \[it\].

8: 

[[Luke.7.9|9]] When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.

9: 

[[Luke.7.10|10]] And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.

10:
