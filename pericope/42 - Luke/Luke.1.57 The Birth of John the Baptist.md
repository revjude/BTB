[[Luke.1|Luke 1:57 - Luke 1:66]]
*The Birth of John the Baptist*

[[Luke.1.57|57]] Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.

57: 

[[Luke.1.58|58]] And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.

58: 

[[Luke.1.59|59]] And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.

59: 

[[Luke.1.60|60]] And his mother answered and said, Not \[so\]; but he shall be called John.

60: 

[[Luke.1.61|61]] And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.

61: 

[[Luke.1.62|62]] And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.

62: 

[[Luke.1.63|63]] And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.

63: 

[[Luke.1.64|64]] And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue \[loosed\], and he spake, and praised God.

64: 

[[Luke.1.65|65]] And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.

65: 

[[Luke.1.66|66]] And all they that heard \[them\] laid \[them\] up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.

66:
