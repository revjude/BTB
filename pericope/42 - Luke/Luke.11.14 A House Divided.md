[[Luke.11|Luke 11:14 - Luke 11:23]]
*A House Divided*

[[Luke.11.14|14]] And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.

14: 

[[Luke.11.15|15]] But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.

15: 

[[Luke.11.16|16]] And others, tempting \[him\], sought of him a sign from heaven.

16: 

[[Luke.11.17|17]] But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house \[divided\] against a house falleth.

17: 

[[Luke.11.18|18]] If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.

18: 

[[Luke.11.19|19]] And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast \[them\] out? therefore shall they be your judges.

19: 

[[Luke.11.20|20]] But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.

20: 

[[Luke.11.21|21]] When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:

21: 

[[Luke.11.22|22]] But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.

22: 

[[Luke.11.23|23]] He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.

23:
