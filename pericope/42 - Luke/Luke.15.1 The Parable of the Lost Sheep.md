[[Luke.15|Luke 15:1 - Luke 15:7]]
*The Parable of the Lost Sheep*

[[Luke.15.1|1]] Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.

1: 

[[Luke.15.2|2]] And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.

2: 

[[Luke.15.3|3]] And he spake this parable unto them, saying,

3: 

[[Luke.15.4|4]] What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?

4: 

[[Luke.15.5|5]] And when he hath found \[it\], he layeth \[it\] on his shoulders, rejoicing.

5: 

[[Luke.15.6|6]] And when he cometh home, he calleth together \[his\] friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.

6: 

[[Luke.15.7|7]] I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.

7:
