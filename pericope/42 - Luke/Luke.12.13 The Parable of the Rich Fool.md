[[Luke.12|Luke 12:13 - Luke 12:21]]
*The Parable of the Rich Fool*

[[Luke.12.13|13]] And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.

13: 

[[Luke.12.14|14]] And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?

14: 

[[Luke.12.15|15]] And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.

15: 

[[Luke.12.16|16]] And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:

16: 

[[Luke.12.17|17]] And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?

17: 

[[Luke.12.18|18]] And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.

18: 

[[Luke.12.19|19]] And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, \[and\] be merry.

19: 

[[Luke.12.20|20]] But God said unto him, \[Thou\] fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?

20: 

[[Luke.12.21|21]] So \[is\] he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.

21:
