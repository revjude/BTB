[[Luke.11|Luke 11:24 - Luke 11:26]]
*An Unclean Spirit Returns*

[[Luke.11.24|24]] When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.

24: 

[[Luke.11.25|25]] And when he cometh, he findeth \[it\] swept and garnished.

25: 

[[Luke.11.26|26]] Then goeth he, and taketh \[to him\] seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last \[state\] of that man is worse than the first.

26:
