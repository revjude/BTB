[[Luke.22|Luke 22:7 - Luke 22:13]]
*Preparing the Passover*

[[Luke.22.7|7]] Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.

7: 

[[Luke.22.8|8]] And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.

8: 

[[Luke.22.9|9]] And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?

9: 

[[Luke.22.10|10]] And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.

10: 

[[Luke.22.11|11]] And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?

11: 

[[Luke.22.12|12]] And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.

12: 

[[Luke.22.13|13]] And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.

13:
