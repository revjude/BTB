[[Luke.21|Luke 21:29 - Luke 21:33]]
*The Lesson of the Fig Tree*

[[Luke.21.29|29]] And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;

29: 

[[Luke.21.30|30]] When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand.

30: 

[[Luke.21.31|31]] So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.

31: 

[[Luke.21.32|32]] Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.

32: 

[[Luke.21.33|33]] Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.

33:
