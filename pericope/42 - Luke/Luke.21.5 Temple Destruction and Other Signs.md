[[Luke.21|Luke 21:5 - Luke 21:9]]
*Temple Destruction and Other Signs*

[[Luke.21.5|5]] And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,

5: 

[[Luke.21.6|6]] \[As for\] these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.

6: 

[[Luke.21.7|7]] And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign \[will there be\] when these things shall come to pass?

7: 

[[Luke.21.8|8]] And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am \[Christ\]; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.

8: 

[[Luke.21.9|9]] But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end \[is\] not by and by.

9:
