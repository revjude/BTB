[[Luke.17|Luke 17:1 - Luke 17:4]]
*Temptations and Trespasses*

[[Luke.17.1|1]] Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe \[unto him\], through whom they come!

1: 

[[Luke.17.2|2]] It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.

[[Luke.17.3|3]] Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.

3:

4:
