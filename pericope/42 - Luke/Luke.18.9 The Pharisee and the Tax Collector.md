[[Luke.18|Luke 18:9 - Luke 18:14]]
*The Pharisee and the Tax Collector*

[[Luke.18.9|9]] And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:

9: 

[[Luke.18.10|10]] Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.

10: 

[[Luke.18.11|11]] The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men \[are\], extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.

11: 

[[Luke.18.12|12]] I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.

12: 

[[Luke.18.13|13]] And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as \[his\] eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.

13: 

[[Luke.18.14|14]] I tell you, this man went down to his house justified \[rather\] than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

14:
