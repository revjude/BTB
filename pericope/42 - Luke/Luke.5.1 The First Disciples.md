[[Luke.5|Luke 5:1 - Luke 5:11]]
*The First Disciples*

[[Luke.5.1|1]] And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,

1: 

[[Luke.5.2|2]] And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing \[their\] nets.

2: 

[[Luke.5.3|3]] And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.

3: 

[[Luke.5.4|4]] Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.

4: 

[[Luke.5.5|5]] And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.

5: 

[[Luke.5.6|6]] And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.

6: 

[[Luke.5.7|7]] And they beckoned unto \[their\] partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.

7: 

[[Luke.5.8|8]] When Simon Peter saw \[it\], he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.

8: 

[[Luke.5.9|9]] For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:

9: 

[[Luke.5.10|10]] And so \[was\] also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.

10: 

[[Luke.5.11|11]] And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.

11:
