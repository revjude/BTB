[[Luke.12|Luke 12:22 - Luke 12:31]]
*Do Not Worry*

[[Luke.12.22|22]] And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.

22: 

[[Luke.12.23|23]] The life is more than meat, and the body \[is more\] than raiment.

23: 

[[Luke.12.24|24]] Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?

24: 

[[Luke.12.25|25]] And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?

25: 

[[Luke.12.26|26]] If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?

26: 

[[Luke.12.27|27]] Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

27: 

[[Luke.12.28|28]] If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more \[will he clothe\] you, O ye of little faith?

28: 

[[Luke.12.29|29]] And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.

29: 

[[Luke.12.30|30]] For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.

30: 

[[Luke.12.31|31]] But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.

31:
