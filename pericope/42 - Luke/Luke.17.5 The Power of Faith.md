[[Luke.17|Luke 17:5 - Luke 17:10]]
*The Power of Faith*

[[Luke.17.5|5]] And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.

5: 

[[Luke.17.6|6]] And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.

6: 

[[Luke.17.7|7]] But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?

7: 

[[Luke.17.8|8]] And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?

8: 

[[Luke.17.9|9]] Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.

9: 

[[Luke.17.10|10]] So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.

10:
