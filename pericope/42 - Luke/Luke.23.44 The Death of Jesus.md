[[Luke.23|Luke 23:44 - Luke 23:49]]
*The Death of Jesus*

[[Luke.23.44|44]] And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.

44: 

[[Luke.23.45|45]] And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.

45: 

[[Luke.23.46|46]] And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.

46: 

[[Luke.23.47|47]] Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.

47: 

[[Luke.23.48|48]] And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.

48: 

[[Luke.23.49|49]] And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.

49:
