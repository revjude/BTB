[[Luke.12|Luke 12:57 - Luke 12:59]]
*Reconciling with an Adversary*

[[Luke.12.57|57]] Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?

57: 

[[Luke.12.58|58]] When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, \[as thou art\] in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.

58: 

[[Luke.12.59|59]] I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite.

59:
