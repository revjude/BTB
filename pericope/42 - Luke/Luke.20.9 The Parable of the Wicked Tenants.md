[[Luke.20|Luke 20:9 - Luke 20:18]]
*The Parable of the Wicked Tenants*

[[Luke.20.9|9]] Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.

9: 

[[Luke.20.10|10]] And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent \[him\] away empty.

10: 

[[Luke.20.11|11]] And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated \[him\] shamefully, and sent \[him\] away empty.

11: 

[[Luke.20.12|12]] And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast \[him\] out.

12: 

[[Luke.20.13|13]] Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence \[him\] when they see him.

13: 

[[Luke.20.14|14]] But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.

14: 

[[Luke.20.15|15]] So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed \[him\]. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?

15: 

[[Luke.20.16|16]] He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard \[it\], they said, God forbid.

16: 

[[Luke.20.17|17]] And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?

17: 

[[Luke.20.18|18]] Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

18:
