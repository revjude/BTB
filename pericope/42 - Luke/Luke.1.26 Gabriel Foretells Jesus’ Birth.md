[[Luke.1|Luke 1:26 - Luke 1:38]]
*Gabriel Foretells Jesus’ Birth*

[[Luke.1.26|26]] And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,

26: 

[[Luke.1.27|27]] To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name \[was\] Mary.

27: 

[[Luke.1.28|28]] And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, \[thou that art\] highly favoured, the Lord \[is\] with thee: blessed \[art\] thou among women.

28: 

[[Luke.1.29|29]] And when she saw \[him\], she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.

29: 

[[Luke.1.30|30]] And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.

30: 

[[Luke.1.31|31]] And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.

31: 

[[Luke.1.32|32]] He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:

32: 

[[Luke.1.33|33]] And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.

33: 

[[Luke.1.34|34]] Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?

34: 

[[Luke.1.35|35]] And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.

35: 

[[Luke.1.36|36]] And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.

36: 

[[Luke.1.37|37]] For with God nothing shall be impossible.

37: 

[[Luke.1.38|38]] And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.

38:
