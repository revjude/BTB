[[Luke.12|Luke 12:49 - Luke 12:53]]
*Not Peace but Division*

[[Luke.12.49|49]] I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?

49: 

[[Luke.12.50|50]] But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!

50: 

[[Luke.12.51|51]] Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:

51: 

[[Luke.12.52|52]] For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.

52: 

[[Luke.12.53|53]] The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.

53:
