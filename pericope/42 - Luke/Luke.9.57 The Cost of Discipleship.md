*The Cost of Discipleship*

[[Luke.9.57|57]] And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain \[man\] said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.

57: 

[[Luke.9.58|58]] And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air \[have\] nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay \[his\] head.

58: 

[[Luke.9.59|59]] And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.

59: 

[[Luke.9.60|60]] Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.

60: 

[[Luke.9.61|61]] And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.

61: 

[[Luke.9.62|62]] And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
