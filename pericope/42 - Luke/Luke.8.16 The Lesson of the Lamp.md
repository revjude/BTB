[[Luke.8|Luke 8:16 - Luke 8:18]]
*The Lesson of the Lamp*

[[Luke.8.16|16]] No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth \[it\] under a bed; but setteth \[it\] on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.

16: 

[[Luke.8.17|17]] For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither \[any thing\] hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.

17: 

[[Luke.8.18|18]] Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.

18:
