[[Luke.5|Luke 5:36 - Luke 5:39]]
*The Patches and the Wineskins*

[[Luke.5.36|36]] And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was \[taken\] out of the new agreeth not with the old.

36: 

[[Luke.5.37|37]] And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.

37: 

[[Luke.5.38|38]] But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.

38: 

[[Luke.5.39|39]] No man also having drunk old \[wine\] straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.

39:
