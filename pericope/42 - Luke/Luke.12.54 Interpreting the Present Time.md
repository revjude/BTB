[[Luke.12|Luke 12:54 - Luke 12:56]]
*Interpreting the Present Time*

[[Luke.12.54|54]] And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.

54: 

[[Luke.12.55|55]] And when \[ye see\] the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass.

55: 

[[Luke.12.56|56]] \[Ye\] hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?

56:
