[[Luke.7|Luke 7:36 - Luke 7:50]]
*A Sinful Woman Anoints Jesus*

[[Luke.7.36|36]] And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.

36: 

[[Luke.7.37|37]] And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that \[Jesus\] sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,

37: 

[[Luke.7.38|38]] And stood at his feet behind \[him\] weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe \[them\] with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed \[them\] with the ointment.

38: 

[[Luke.7.39|39]] Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw \[it\], he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman \[this is\] that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.

39: 

[[Luke.7.40|40]] And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.

40: 

[[Luke.7.41|41]] There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.

41: 

[[Luke.7.42|42]] And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?

42: 

[[Luke.7.43|43]] Simon answered and said, I suppose that \[he\], to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.

43: 

[[Luke.7.44|44]] And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped \[them\] with the hairs of her head.

44: 

[[Luke.7.45|45]] Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.

45: 

[[Luke.7.46|46]] My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.

46: 

[[Luke.7.47|47]] Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, \[the same\] loveth little.

47: 

[[Luke.7.48|48]] And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.

48: 

[[Luke.7.49|49]] And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?

49: 

[[Luke.7.50|50]] And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.

50:
