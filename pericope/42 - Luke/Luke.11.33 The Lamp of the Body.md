[[Luke.11|Luke 11:33 - Luke 11:36]]
*The Lamp of the Body*

[[Luke.11.33|33]] No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth \[it\] in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.

33: 

[[Luke.11.34|34]] The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when \[thine eye\] is evil, thy body also \[is\] full of darkness.

34: 

[[Luke.11.35|35]] Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.

35: 

[[Luke.11.36|36]] If thy whole body therefore \[be\] full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.

36:
