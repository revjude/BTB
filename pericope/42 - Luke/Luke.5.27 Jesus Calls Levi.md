[[Luke.5.27|27]] And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.

27: 

[[Luke.5.28|28]] And he left all, rose up, and followed him.

28: 

[[Luke.5.29|29]] And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.

29: 

[[Luke.5.30|30]] But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?

[[Luke.5.31|31]] And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.

31:
