[[Luke.6|Luke 6:27 - Luke 6:36]]
*Love Your Enemies*

[[Luke.6.27|27]] But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,

27: 

[[Luke.6.28|28]] Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.

28: 

[[Luke.6.29|29]] And unto him that smiteth thee on the \[one\] cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not \[to take thy\] coat also.

29: 

[[Luke.6.30|30]] Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask \[them\] not again.

30: 

[[Luke.6.31|31]] And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.

31: 

[[Luke.6.32|32]] For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.

32: 

[[Luke.6.33|33]] And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.

33: 

[[Luke.6.34|34]] And if ye lend \[to them\] of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.

34: 

[[Luke.6.35|35]] But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and \[to\] the evil.

35: 

[[Luke.6.36|36]] Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.

36:
