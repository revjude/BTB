[[Luke.4.32|32]] And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.

32: 

[[Luke.4.33|33]] And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,

33: 

[[Luke.4.34|34]] Saying, Let \[us\] alone; what have we to do with thee, \[thou\] Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.

[[Luke.4.36|36]] And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word \[is\] this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.

36: 

[[Luke.4.37|37]] And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.
