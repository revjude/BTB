[[Luke.8|Luke 8:26 - Luke 8:39]]
*The Demons and the Pigs*

[[Luke.8.26|26]] And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.

26: 

[[Luke.8.27|27]] And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in \[any\] house, but in the tombs.

27: 

[[Luke.8.28|28]] When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, \[thou\] Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.

28: 

[[Luke.8.29|29]] (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)

29: 

[[Luke.8.30|30]] And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.

30: 

[[Luke.8.31|31]] And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.

31: 

[[Luke.8.32|32]] And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.

32: 

[[Luke.8.33|33]] Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.

33: 

[[Luke.8.34|34]] When they that fed \[them\] saw what was done, they fled, and went and told \[it\] in the city and in the country.

34: 

[[Luke.8.35|35]] Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.

35: 

[[Luke.8.36|36]] They also which saw \[it\] told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.

36: 

[[Luke.8.37|37]] Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.

37: 

[[Luke.8.38|38]] Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,

38: 

[[Luke.8.39|39]] Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.
