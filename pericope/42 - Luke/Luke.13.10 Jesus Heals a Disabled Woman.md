[[Luke.13|Luke 13:10 - Luke 13:17]]
*Jesus Heals a Disabled Woman*

[[Luke.13.10|10]] And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.

10: 

[[Luke.13.11|11]] And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up \[herself\].

11: 

[[Luke.13.12|12]] And when Jesus saw her, he called \[her to him\], and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.

12: 

[[Luke.13.13|13]] And he laid \[his\] hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.

13: 

[[Luke.13.14|14]] And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.

14: 

[[Luke.13.15|15]] The Lord then answered him, and said, \[Thou\] hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or \[his\] ass from the stall, and lead \[him\] away to watering?

15: 

[[Luke.13.16|16]] And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?

16: 

[[Luke.13.17|17]] And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.

17:
