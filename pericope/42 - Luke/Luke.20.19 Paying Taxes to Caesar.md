[[Luke.20|Luke 20:19 - Luke 20:26]]
*Paying Taxes to Caesar*

[[Luke.20.19|19]] And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.

19: 

[[Luke.20.20|20]] And they watched \[him\], and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.

20: 

[[Luke.20.21|21]] And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person \[of any\], but teachest the way of God truly:

21: 

[[Luke.20.22|22]] Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?

22: 

[[Luke.20.23|23]] But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?

23: 

[[Luke.20.24|24]] Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar’s.

24: 

[[Luke.20.25|25]] And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar’s, and unto God the things which be God’s.

25: 

[[Luke.20.26|26]] And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.

26:
