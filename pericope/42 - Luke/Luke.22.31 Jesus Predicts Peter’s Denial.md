[[Luke.22|Luke 22:31 - Luke 22:38]]
*Jesus Predicts Peter’s Denial*

[[Luke.22.31|31]] And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired \[to have\] you, that he may sift \[you\] as wheat:

31: 

[[Luke.22.32|32]] But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.

32: 

[[Luke.22.33|33]] And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.

33: 

[[Luke.22.34|34]] And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.

34: 

[[Luke.22.35|35]] And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.

35: 

[[Luke.22.36|36]] Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take \[it\], and likewise \[his\] scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.

36: 

[[Luke.22.37|37]] For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.

37: 

[[Luke.22.38|38]] And they said, Lord, behold, here \[are\] two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.

38:
