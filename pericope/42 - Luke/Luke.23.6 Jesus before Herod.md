[[Luke.23|Luke 23:6 - Luke 23:12]]
*Jesus before Herod*

[[Luke.23.6|6]] When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.

6: 

[[Luke.23.7|7]] And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.

7: 

[[Luke.23.8|8]] And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long \[season\], because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.

8: 

[[Luke.23.9|9]] Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.

9: 

[[Luke.23.10|10]] And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.

10: 

[[Luke.23.11|11]] And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked \[him\], and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.

11: 

[[Luke.23.12|12]] And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.

12:
