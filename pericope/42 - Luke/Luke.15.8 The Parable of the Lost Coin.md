[[Luke.15|Luke 15:8 - Luke 15:10]]
*The Parable of the Lost Coin*

[[Luke.15.8|8]] Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find \[it\]?

8: 

[[Luke.15.9|9]] And when she hath found \[it\], she calleth \[her\] friends and \[her\] neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.

9: 

[[Luke.15.10|10]] Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.

10:
