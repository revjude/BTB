[[Luke.1|Luke 1:39 - Luke 1:45]]
*Mary Visits Elizabeth*

[[Luke.1.39|39]] And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;

39: 

[[Luke.1.40|40]] And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.

40: 

[[Luke.1.41|41]] And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:

41: 

[[Luke.1.42|42]] And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed \[art\] thou among women, and blessed \[is\] the fruit of thy womb.

42: 

[[Luke.1.43|43]] And whence \[is\] this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

43: 

[[Luke.1.44|44]] For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.

44: 

[[Luke.1.45|45]] And blessed \[is\] she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.

45:
