[[Luke.2|Luke 2:41 - Luke 2:52]]
*The Boy Jesus at the Temple*

[[Luke.2.41|41]] Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.

41: 

[[Luke.2.42|42]] And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.

42: 

[[Luke.2.43|43]] And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not \[of it\].

43: 

[[Luke.2.44|44]] But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day’s journey; and they sought him among \[their\] kinsfolk and acquaintance.

44: 

[[Luke.2.45|45]] And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.

45: 

[[Luke.2.46|46]] And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.

46: 

[[Luke.2.47|47]] And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.

47: 

[[Luke.2.48|48]] And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.

48: 

[[Luke.2.49|49]] And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s business?

49: 

[[Luke.2.50|50]] And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.

50: 

[[Luke.2.51|51]] And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.

51: 

[[Luke.2.52|52]] And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.

52:
