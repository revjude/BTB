[[Luke.20.46|46]] Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;

46: 

[[Luke.20.47|47]] Which devour widows’ houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.

47:
