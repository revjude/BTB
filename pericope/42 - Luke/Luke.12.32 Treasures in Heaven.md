[[Luke.12|Luke 12:32 - Luke 12:34]]
*Treasures in Heaven*

[[Luke.12.32|32]] Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.

32: 

[[Luke.12.33|33]] Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.

33: 

[[Luke.12.34|34]] For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

34:
