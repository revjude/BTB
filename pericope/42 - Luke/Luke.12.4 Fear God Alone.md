[[Luke.12|Luke 12:4 - Luke 12:7]]
*Fear God Alone*

[[Luke.12.4|4]] And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.

4: 

[[Luke.12.5|5]] But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.

5: 

[[Luke.12.6|6]] Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?

6: 

[[Luke.12.7|7]] But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.

7:
