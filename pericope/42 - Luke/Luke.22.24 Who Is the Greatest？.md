[[Luke.22|Luke 22:24 - Luke 22:30]]
*Who Is the Greatest？*

[[Luke.22.24|24]] And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.

24: 

[[Luke.22.25|25]] And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.

25: 

[[Luke.22.26|26]] But ye \[shall\] not \[be\] so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.

26: 

[[Luke.22.27|27]] For whether \[is\] greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? \[is\] not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.

27: 

[[Luke.22.28|28]] Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.

28: 

[[Luke.22.29|29]] And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;

29: 

[[Luke.22.30|30]] That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

30:
