[[Luke.10|Luke 10:21 - Luke 10:24]]
*Jesus’ Prayer of Thanksgiving*

[[Luke.10.21|21]] In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.

21: 

[[Luke.10.22|22]] All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and \[he\] to whom the Son will reveal \[him\].

22: 

[[Luke.10.23|23]] And he turned him unto \[his\] disciples, and said privately, Blessed \[are\] the eyes which see the things that ye see:

23: 

[[Luke.10.24|24]] For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen \[them\]; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard \[them\].

24:
