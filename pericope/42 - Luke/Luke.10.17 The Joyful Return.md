[[Luke.10|Luke 10:17 - Luke 10:20]]
*The Joyful Return*

[[Luke.10.17|17]] And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name.

17: 

[[Luke.10.18|18]] And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.

18: 

[[Luke.10.19|19]] Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.

19: 

[[Luke.10.20|20]] Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.

20:
