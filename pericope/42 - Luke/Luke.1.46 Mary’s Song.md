[[Luke.1|Luke 1:46 - Luke 1:56]]
*Mary’s Song*

[[Luke.1.46|46]] And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,

46: 

[[Luke.1.47|47]] And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.

47: 

[[Luke.1.48|48]] For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.

48: 

[[Luke.1.49|49]] For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy \[is\] his name.

49: 

[[Luke.1.50|50]] And his mercy \[is\] on them that fear him from generation to generation.

50: 

[[Luke.1.51|51]] He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.

51: 

[[Luke.1.52|52]] He hath put down the mighty from \[their\] seats, and exalted them of low degree.

52: 

[[Luke.1.53|53]] He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.

53: 

[[Luke.1.54|54]] He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of \[his\] mercy;

54: 

[[Luke.1.55|55]] As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.

55: 

[[Luke.1.56|56]] And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.

56:
