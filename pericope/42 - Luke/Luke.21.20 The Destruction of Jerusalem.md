[[Luke.21|Luke 21:20 - Luke 21:24]]
*The Destruction of Jerusalem*

[[Luke.21.20|20]] And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.

20: 

[[Luke.21.21|21]] Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.

21: 

[[Luke.21.22|22]] For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.

22: 

[[Luke.21.23|23]] But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.

23: 

[[Luke.21.24|24]] And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.

24:
