[[Luke.22|Luke 22:39 - Luke 22:46]]
*Jesus Prays on the Mount of Olives*

[[Luke.22.39|39]] And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.

39: 

[[Luke.22.40|40]] And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.

40: 

[[Luke.22.41|41]] And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,

41: 

[[Luke.22.42|42]] Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.

42: 

[[Luke.22.43|43]] And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.

43: 

[[Luke.22.44|44]] And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.

44: 

[[Luke.22.45|45]] And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,

45: 

[[Luke.22.46|46]] And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.

46:
