[[Luke.16|Luke 16:14 - Luke 16:18]]
*The Law and the Prophets*

[[Luke.16.14|14]] And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.

14: 

[[Luke.16.15|15]] And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.

15: 

[[Luke.16.16|16]] The law and the prophets \[were\] until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.

16: 

[[Luke.16.17|17]] And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.

17: 

[[Luke.16.18|18]] Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from \[her\] husband committeth adultery.

18:
