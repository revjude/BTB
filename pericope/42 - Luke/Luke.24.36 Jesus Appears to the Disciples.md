[[Luke.24|Luke 24:36 - Luke 24:49]]
*Jesus Appears to the Disciples*

[[Luke.24.36|36]] And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace \[be\] unto you.

36: 

[[Luke.24.37|37]] But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.

37: 

[[Luke.24.38|38]] And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?

38: 

[[Luke.24.39|39]] Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.

39: 

[[Luke.24.40|40]] And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them \[his\] hands and \[his\] feet.

40: 

[[Luke.24.41|41]] And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?

41: 

[[Luke.24.42|42]] And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.

42: 

[[Luke.24.43|43]] And he took \[it\], and did eat before them.

43: 

[[Luke.24.44|44]] And he said unto them, These \[are\] the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and \[in\] the prophets, and \[in\] the psalms, concerning me.

44: 

[[Luke.24.45|45]] Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,

45: 

[[Luke.24.46|46]] And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:

46: 

[[Luke.24.47|47]] And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

47: 

[[Luke.24.48|48]] And ye are witnesses of these things.

48: 

[[Luke.24.49|49]] And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.

49:
