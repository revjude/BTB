[[Luke.7|Luke 7:18 - Luke 7:23]]
*John’s Inquiry*

[[Luke.7.18|18]] And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.

18: 

[[Luke.7.19|19]] And John calling \[unto him\] two of his disciples sent \[them\] to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?

19: 

[[Luke.7.20|20]] When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?

20: 

[[Luke.7.21|21]] And in that same hour he cured many of \[their\] infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many \[that were\] blind he gave sight.

21: 

[[Luke.7.22|22]] Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.

22: 

[[Luke.7.23|23]] And blessed is \[he\], whosoever shall not be offended in me.

23:
