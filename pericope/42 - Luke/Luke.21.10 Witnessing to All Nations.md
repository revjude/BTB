[[Luke.21|Luke 21:10 - Luke 21:19]]
*Witnessing to All Nations*

[[Luke.21.10|10]] Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:

10: 

[[Luke.21.11|11]] And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.

11: 

[[Luke.21.12|12]] But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute \[you\], delivering \[you\] up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name’s sake.

12: 

[[Luke.21.13|13]] And it shall turn to you for a testimony.

13: 

[[Luke.21.14|14]] Settle \[it\] therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:

14: 

[[Luke.21.15|15]] For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.

15: 

[[Luke.21.16|16]] And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and \[some\] of you shall they cause to be put to death.

16: 

[[Luke.21.17|17]] And ye shall be hated of all \[men\] for my name’s sake.

17: 

[[Luke.21.18|18]] But there shall not an hair of your head perish.

18: 

[[Luke.21.19|19]] In your patience possess ye your souls.

19:
