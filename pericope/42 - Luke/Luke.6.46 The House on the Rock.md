[[Luke.6|Luke 6:46 - Luke 6:49]]
*The House on the Rock*

[[Luke.6.46|46]] And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?

46: 

[[Luke.6.47|47]] Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:

47: 

[[Luke.6.48|48]] He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.

48: 

[[Luke.6.49|49]] But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.

49:
