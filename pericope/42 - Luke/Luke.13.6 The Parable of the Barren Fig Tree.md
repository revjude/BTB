[[Luke.13|Luke 13:6 - Luke 13:9]]
*The Parable of the Barren Fig Tree*

[[Luke.13.6|6]] He spake also this parable; A certain \[man\] had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.

6: 

[[Luke.13.7|7]] Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?

7: 

[[Luke.13.8|8]] And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung \[it\]:

8: 

[[Luke.13.9|9]] And if it bear fruit, \[well\]: and if not, \[then\] after that thou shalt cut it down.

9:
