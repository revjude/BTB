[[Luke.5|Luke 5:12 - Luke 5:16]]
*The Leper’s Prayer*

[[Luke.5.12|12]] And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on \[his\] face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

12: 

[[Luke.5.13|13]] And he put forth \[his\] hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.

13: 

[[Luke.5.14|14]] And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.

14: 

[[Luke.5.15|15]] But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.

15: 

[[Luke.5.16|16]] And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.

16:
