[[Luke.9|Luke 9:51 - Luke 9:56]]
*The Samaritans Reject Jesus*

[[Luke.9.51|51]] And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,

51: 

[[Luke.9.52|52]] And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.

52: 

[[Luke.9.53|53]] And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.

53: 

[[Luke.9.54|54]] And when his disciples James and John saw \[this\], they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?

54: 

[[Luke.9.55|55]] But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.

55: 

[[Luke.9.56|56]] For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save \[them\]. And they went to another village.

56:
