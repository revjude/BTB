[[Luke.6|Luke 6:20 - Luke 6:23]]
*The Beatitudes*

[[Luke.6.20|20]] And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed \[be ye\] poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.

20: 

[[Luke.6.21|21]] Blessed \[are ye\] that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed \[are ye\] that weep now: for ye shall laugh.

21: 

[[Luke.6.22|22]] Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you \[from their company\], and shall reproach \[you\], and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.

22: 

[[Luke.6.23|23]] Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward \[is\] great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.

23:
