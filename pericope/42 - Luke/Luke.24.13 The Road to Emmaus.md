[[Luke.24|Luke 24:13 - Luke 24:35]]
*The Road to Emmaus*

[[Luke.24.13|13]] And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem \[about\] threescore furlongs.

13: 

[[Luke.24.14|14]] And they talked together of all these things which had happened.

14: 

[[Luke.24.15|15]] And it came to pass, that, while they communed \[together\] and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.

15: 

[[Luke.24.16|16]] But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.

16: 

[[Luke.24.17|17]] And he said unto them, What manner of communications \[are\] these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?

17: 

[[Luke.24.18|18]] And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?

18: 

[[Luke.24.19|19]] And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:

19: 

[[Luke.24.20|20]] And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.

20: 

[[Luke.24.21|21]] But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.

21: 

[[Luke.24.22|22]] Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;

22: 

[[Luke.24.23|23]] And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.

23: 

[[Luke.24.24|24]] And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found \[it\] even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.

24: 

[[Luke.24.25|25]] Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:

25: 

[[Luke.24.26|26]] Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?

26: 

[[Luke.24.27|27]] And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.

27: 

[[Luke.24.28|28]] And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.

28: 

[[Luke.24.29|29]] But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.

29: 

[[Luke.24.30|30]] And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed \[it\], and brake, and gave to them.

30: 

[[Luke.24.31|31]] And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.

31: 

[[Luke.24.32|32]] And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?

32: 

[[Luke.24.33|33]] And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,

33: 

[[Luke.24.34|34]] Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.

34: 

[[Luke.24.35|35]] And they told what things \[were done\] in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.

35:
