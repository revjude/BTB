[[Luke.19|Luke 19:28 - Luke 19:40]]
*The Triumphal Entry*

[[Luke.19.28|28]] And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.

28: 

[[Luke.19.29|29]] And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called \[the mount\] of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,

29: 

[[Luke.19.30|30]] Saying, Go ye into the village over against \[you\]; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring \[him hither\].

30: 

[[Luke.19.31|31]] And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose \[him\]? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.

31: 

[[Luke.19.32|32]] And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.

32: 

[[Luke.19.33|33]] And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?

33: 

[[Luke.19.34|34]] And they said, The Lord hath need of him.

34: 

[[Luke.19.35|35]] And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.

35: 

[[Luke.19.36|36]] And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.

36: 

[[Luke.19.37|37]] And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;

37: 

[[Luke.19.38|38]] Saying, Blessed \[be\] the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.

38: 

[[Luke.19.39|39]] And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.

39: 

[[Luke.19.40|40]] And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.

40:
