[[Luke.14|Luke 14:34 - Luke 14:35]]
*Good Salt*

[[Luke.14.34|34]] Salt \[is\] good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?

34: 

[[Luke.14.35|35]] It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; \[but\] men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

35:
