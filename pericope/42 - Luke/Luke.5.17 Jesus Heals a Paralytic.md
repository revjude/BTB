[[Luke.5|Luke 5:17 - Luke 5:26]]
*Jesus Heals a Paralytic*

[[Luke.5.17|17]] And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was \[present\] to heal them.

17: 

[[Luke.5.18|18]] And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought \[means\] to bring him in, and to lay \[him\] before him.

18: 

[[Luke.5.19|19]] And when they could not find by what \[way\] they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with \[his\] couch into the midst before Jesus.

19: 

[[Luke.5.20|20]] And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.

20: 

[[Luke.5.21|21]] And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?

21: 

[[Luke.5.22|22]] But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?

22: 

[[Luke.5.23|23]] Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?

23: 

[[Luke.5.24|24]] But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.

24: 

[[Luke.5.25|25]] And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.

25: 

[[Luke.5.26|26]] And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.

26:
