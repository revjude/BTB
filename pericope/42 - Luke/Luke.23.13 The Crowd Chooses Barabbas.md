[[Luke.23|Luke 23:13 - Luke 23:25]]
*The Crowd Chooses Barabbas*

[[Luke.23.13|13]] And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,

13: 

[[Luke.23.14|14]] Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined \[him\] before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:

14: 

[[Luke.23.15|15]] No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.

15: 

[[Luke.23.16|16]] I will therefore chastise him, and release \[him\].

16: 

[[Luke.23.18|18]] And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this \[man\], and release unto us Barabbas:

18: 

[[Luke.23.19|19]] (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)

19: 

[[Luke.23.20|20]] Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.

20: 

[[Luke.23.21|21]] But they cried, saying, Crucify \[him\], crucify him.

21: 

[[Luke.23.22|22]] And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let \[him\] go.

22: 

[[Luke.23.23|23]] And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.

23: 

[[Luke.23.24|24]] And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.

24: 

[[Luke.23.25|25]] And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.

25:
