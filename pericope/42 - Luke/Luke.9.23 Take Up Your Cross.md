[[Luke.9|Luke 9:23 - Luke 9:27]]
*Take Up Your Cross*

[[Luke.9.23|23]] And he said to \[them\] all, If any \[man\] will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.

23: 

[[Luke.9.24|24]] For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.

24: 

[[Luke.9.25|25]] For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?

25: 

[[Luke.9.26|26]] For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and \[in his\] Father’s, and of the holy angels.

26: 

[[Luke.9.27|27]] But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.

27:
