[[Luke.7|Luke 7:24 - Luke 7:35]]
*Jesus Testifies about John*

[[Luke.7.24|24]] And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?

24: 

[[Luke.7.25|25]] But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts.

25: 

[[Luke.7.26|26]] But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.

26: 

[[Luke.7.27|27]] This is \[he\], of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

27: 

[[Luke.7.28|28]] For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.

28: 

[[Luke.7.29|29]] And all the people that heard \[him\], and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.

29: 

[[Luke.7.30|30]] But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.

30: 

[[Luke.7.31|31]] And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?

31: 

[[Luke.7.32|32]] They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.

32: 

[[Luke.7.33|33]] For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.

33: 

[[Luke.7.34|34]] The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!

34: 

[[Luke.7.35|35]] But wisdom is justified of all her children.

35:
