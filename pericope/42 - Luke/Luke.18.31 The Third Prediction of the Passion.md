[[Luke.18|Luke 18:31 - Luke 18:34]]
*The Third Prediction of the Passion*

[[Luke.18.31|31]] Then he took \[unto him\] the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.

31: 

[[Luke.18.32|32]] For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:

32: 

[[Luke.18.33|33]] And they shall scourge \[him\], and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.

33: 

[[Luke.18.34|34]] And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.

34:
