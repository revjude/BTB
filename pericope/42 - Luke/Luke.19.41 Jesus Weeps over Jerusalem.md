[[Luke.19|Luke 19:41 - Luke 19:44]]
*Jesus Weeps over Jerusalem*

[[Luke.19.41|41]] And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,

41: 

[[Luke.19.42|42]] Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things \[which belong\] unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.

42: 

[[Luke.19.43|43]] For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,

43: 

[[Luke.19.44|44]] And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.

44:
