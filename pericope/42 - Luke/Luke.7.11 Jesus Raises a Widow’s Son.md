[[Luke.7|Luke 7:11 - Luke 7:17]]
*Jesus Raises a Widow’s Son*

[[Luke.7.11|11]] And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.

11: 

[[Luke.7.12|12]] Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.

12: 

[[Luke.7.13|13]] And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.

13: 

[[Luke.7.14|14]] And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare \[him\] stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.

14: 

[[Luke.7.15|15]] And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.

15: 

[[Luke.7.16|16]] And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.

16: 

[[Luke.7.17|17]] And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.

17:
