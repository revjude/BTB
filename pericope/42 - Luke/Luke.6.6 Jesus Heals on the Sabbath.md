[[Luke.6|Luke 6:6 - Luke 6:11]]
*Jesus Heals on the Sabbath*

[[Luke.6.6|6]] And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.

6: 

[[Luke.6.7|7]] And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.

7: 

[[Luke.6.8|8]] But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.

8: 

[[Luke.6.9|9]] Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy \[it\]?

9: 

[[Luke.6.10|10]] And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.

10: 

[[Luke.6.11|11]] And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.

11:
