[[Luke.13|Luke 13:31 - Luke 13:35]]
*Lament over Jerusalem*

[[Luke.13.31|31]] The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.

31: 

[[Luke.13.32|32]] And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third \[day\] I shall be perfected.

32: 

[[Luke.13.33|33]] Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the \[day\] following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.

33: 

[[Luke.13.34|34]] O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen \[doth gather\] her brood under \[her\] wings, and ye would not!

34: 

[[Luke.13.35|35]] Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until \[the time\] come when ye shall say, Blessed \[is\] he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

35:
