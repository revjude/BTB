[[Luke.24|Luke 24:1 - Luke 24:12]]
*The Resurrection*

[[Luke.24.1|1]] Now upon the first \[day\] of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain \[others\] with them.

1: 

[[Luke.24.2|2]] And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.

2: 

[[Luke.24.3|3]] And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.

3: 

[[Luke.24.4|4]] And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:

4: 

[[Luke.24.5|5]] And as they were afraid, and bowed down \[their\] faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?

5: 

[[Luke.24.6|6]] He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,

6: 

[[Luke.24.7|7]] Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.

7: 

[[Luke.24.8|8]] And they remembered his words,

8: 

[[Luke.24.9|9]] And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.

9: 

[[Luke.24.10|10]] It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary \[the mother\] of James, and other \[women that were\] with them, which told these things unto the apostles.

10: 

[[Luke.24.11|11]] And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.

11: 

[[Luke.24.12|12]] Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.

12:
