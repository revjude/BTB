[[Luke.22|Luke 22:54 - Luke 22:62]]
*Peter Denies Jesus*

[[Luke.22.54|54]] Then took they him, and led \[him\], and brought him into the high priest’s house. And Peter followed afar off.

54: 

[[Luke.22.55|55]] And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.

55: 

[[Luke.22.56|56]] But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.

56: 

[[Luke.22.57|57]] And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.

57: 

[[Luke.22.58|58]] And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.

58: 

[[Luke.22.59|59]] And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this \[fellow\] also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.

59: 

[[Luke.22.60|60]] And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.

60: 

[[Luke.22.61|61]] And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.

61: 

[[Luke.22.62|62]] And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.

62:
