[[Luke.10|Luke 10:1 - Luke 10:12]]
*Jesus Sends the Seventy-Two*

[[Luke.10.1|1]] After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.

1: 

[[Luke.10.2|2]] Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly \[is\] great, but the labourers \[are\] few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.

2: 

[[Luke.10.3|3]] Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.

3: 

[[Luke.10.4|4]] Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.

4: 

[[Luke.10.5|5]] And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace \[be\] to this house.

5: 

[[Luke.10.6|6]] And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.

6: 

[[Luke.10.7|7]] And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.

7: 

[[Luke.10.8|8]] And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:

8: 

[[Luke.10.9|9]] And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.

9: 

[[Luke.10.10|10]] But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,

10: 

[[Luke.10.11|11]] Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.

11: 

[[Luke.10.12|12]] But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.

12:
