[[Luke.18|Luke 18:18 - Luke 18:30]]
*The Rich Young Ruler*

[[Luke.18.18|18]] And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

18: 

[[Luke.18.19|19]] And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none \[is\] good, save one, \[that is\], God.

19: 

[[Luke.18.20|20]] Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.

20: 

[[Luke.18.21|21]] And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.

21: 

[[Luke.18.22|22]] Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.

22: 

[[Luke.18.23|23]] And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.

23: 

[[Luke.18.24|24]] And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!

24: 

[[Luke.18.25|25]] For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

25: 

[[Luke.18.26|26]] And they that heard \[it\] said, Who then can be saved?

26: 

[[Luke.18.27|27]] And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.

27: 

[[Luke.18.28|28]] Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.

28: 

[[Luke.18.29|29]] And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God’s sake,

29: 

[[Luke.18.30|30]] Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.

30:
