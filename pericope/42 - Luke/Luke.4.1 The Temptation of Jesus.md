[[Luke.4|Luke 4:1 - Luke 4:13]]
*The Temptation of Jesus*

[[Luke.4.1|1]] And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,

1: 

[[Luke.4.2|2]] Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered.

2: 

[[Luke.4.3|3]] And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.

3: 

[[Luke.4.4|4]] And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.

4: 

[[Luke.4.5|5]] And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

5: 

[[Luke.4.6|6]] And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.

6: 

[[Luke.4.7|7]] If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.

7: 

[[Luke.4.8|8]] And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.

8: 

[[Luke.4.9|9]] And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence:

9: 

[[Luke.4.10|10]] For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee:

10: 

[[Luke.4.11|11]] And in \[their\] hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.

11: 

[[Luke.4.12|12]] And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.

12: 

[[Luke.4.13|13]] And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.

13:
