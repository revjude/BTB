[[Luke.17|Luke 17:11 - Luke 17:19]]
*The Ten Lepers*

[[Luke.17.11|11]] And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

11: 

[[Luke.17.12|12]] And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:

12: 

[[Luke.17.13|13]] And they lifted up \[their\] voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.

13: 

[[Luke.17.14|14]] And when he saw \[them\], he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.

14: 

[[Luke.17.15|15]] And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,

15: 

[[Luke.17.16|16]] And fell down on \[his\] face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.

16: 

[[Luke.17.17|17]] And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where \[are\] the nine?

17: 

[[Luke.17.18|18]] There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.

18: 

[[Luke.17.19|19]] And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.

19:
