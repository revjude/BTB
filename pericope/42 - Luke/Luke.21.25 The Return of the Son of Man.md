[[Luke.21|Luke 21:25 - Luke 21:28]]
*The Return of the Son of Man*

[[Luke.21.25|25]] And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;

25: 

[[Luke.21.26|26]] Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.

26: 

[[Luke.21.27|27]] And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.

27: 

[[Luke.21.28|28]] And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.

28:
