1: 

[[Luke.2.2|2]] (\[And\] this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)

2: 

[[Luke.2.3|3]] And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.

3: 

[[Luke.2.4|4]] And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)
