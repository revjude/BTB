*The Joyful Return*

[[2Chr.20.26|26]] And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.

26: 

[[2Chr.20.27|27]] Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.

27: 

[[2Chr.20.28|28]] And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD.

28: 

[[2Chr.20.29|29]] And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of \[those\] countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel.

29: 

[[2Chr.20.30|30]] So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about.

30:
