[[2Chr.22|2 Chronicles 22:8 - 2 Chronicles 22:9]]
*Jehu Kills the Princes of Judah*

[[2Chr.22.8|8]] And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.

8: 

[[2Chr.22.9|9]] And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he \[is\] the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.

9:
