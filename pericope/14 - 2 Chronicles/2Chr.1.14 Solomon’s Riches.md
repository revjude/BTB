[[2Chr.1|2 Chronicles 1:14 - 2 Chronicles 1:17]]
*Solomon’s Riches*

[[2Chr.1.14|14]] And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.

14: 

[[2Chr.1.15|15]] And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem \[as plenteous\] as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that \[are\] in the vale for abundance.

15: 

[[2Chr.1.16|16]] And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.

16: 

[[2Chr.1.17|17]] And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred \[shekels\] of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out \[horses\] for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.

17:
