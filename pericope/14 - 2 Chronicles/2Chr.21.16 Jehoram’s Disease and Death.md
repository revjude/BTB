[[2Chr.21|2 Chronicles 21:16 - 2 Chronicles 21:20]]
*Jehoram’s Disease and Death*

[[2Chr.21.16|16]] Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that \[were\] near the Ethiopians:

16: 

[[2Chr.21.17|17]] And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king’s house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.

17: 

[[2Chr.21.18|18]] And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.

18: 

[[2Chr.21.19|19]] And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.

19: 

[[2Chr.21.20|20]] Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.

20:
