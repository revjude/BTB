[[2Chr.32|2 Chronicles 32:20 - 2 Chronicles 32:23]]
*Jerusalem Delivered from the Assyrians*

[[2Chr.32.20|20]] And for this \[cause\] Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.

20: 

[[2Chr.32.21|21]] And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.

21: 

[[2Chr.32.22|22]] Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all \[other\], and guided them on every side.

22: 

[[2Chr.32.23|23]] And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.

23:
