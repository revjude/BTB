[[2Chr.36|2 Chronicles 36:22 - 2 Chronicles 36:23]]
*The Proclamation of Cyrus*

[[2Chr.36.22|22]] Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD \[spoken\] by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and \[put it\] also in writing, saying,

22: 

[[2Chr.36.23|23]] Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem, which \[is\] in Judah. Who \[is there\] among you of all his people? The LORD his God \[be\] with him, and let him go up.

23:
