[[2Chr.15|2 Chronicles 15:1 - 2 Chronicles 15:7]]
*The Prophecy of Azariah*

[[2Chr.15.1|1]] And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:

1: 

[[2Chr.15.2|2]] And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD \[is\] with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.

2: 

[[2Chr.15.3|3]] Now for a long season Israel \[hath been\] without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.

3: 

[[2Chr.15.4|4]] But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.

4: 

[[2Chr.15.5|5]] And in those times \[there was\] no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations \[were\] upon all the inhabitants of the countries.

5: 

[[2Chr.15.6|6]] And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.

6: 

[[2Chr.15.7|7]] Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.

7:
