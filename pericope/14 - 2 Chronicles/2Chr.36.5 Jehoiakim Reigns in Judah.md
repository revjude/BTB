*Jehoiakim Reigns in Judah*

[[2Chr.36.5|5]] Jehoiakim \[was\] twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did \[that which was\] evil in the sight of the LORD his God.

5: 

[[2Chr.36.6|6]] Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.

6: 

[[2Chr.36.7|7]] Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.

7: 

[[2Chr.36.8|8]] Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they \[are\] written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
