[[2Chr.20|2 Chronicles 20:31 - 2 Chronicles 20:34]]
*Summary of Jehoshaphat’s Reign*

[[2Chr.20.31|31]] And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: \[he was\] thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name \[was\] Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.

31: 

[[2Chr.20.32|32]] And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing \[that which was\] right in the sight of the LORD.

32: 

[[2Chr.20.33|33]] Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.

33: 

[[2Chr.20.34|34]] Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they \[are\] written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who \[is\] mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.

34:
