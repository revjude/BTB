[[2Chr.32|2 Chronicles 32:1 - 2 Chronicles 32:8]]
*Sennacherib Invades Judah*

[[2Chr.32.1|1]] After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself.

1: 

[[2Chr.32.2|2]] And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,

2: 

[[2Chr.32.3|3]] He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which \[were\] without the city: and they did help him.

3: 

[[2Chr.32.4|4]] So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?

4: 

[[2Chr.32.5|5]] Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised \[it\] up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo \[in\] the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.

5: 

[[2Chr.32.6|6]] And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,

6: 

[[2Chr.32.7|7]] Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that \[is\] with him: for \[there be\] more with us than with him:

7: 

[[2Chr.32.8|8]] With him \[is\] an arm of flesh; but with us \[is\] the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.

8:
