[[2Chr.16|2 Chronicles 16:1 - 2 Chronicles 16:6]]
*War between Asa and Baasha*

[[2Chr.16.1|1]] In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.

1: 

[[2Chr.16.2|2]] Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king’s house, and sent to Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,

2: 

[[2Chr.16.3|3]] \[There is\] a league between me and thee, as \[there was\] between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.

3: 

[[2Chr.16.4|4]] And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.

4: 

[[2Chr.16.5|5]] And it came to pass, when Baasha heard \[it\], that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease.

5: 

[[2Chr.16.6|6]] Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.

6:
