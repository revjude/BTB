[[2Chr.28|2 Chronicles 28:5 - 2 Chronicles 28:15]]
*Aram Defeats Judah*

[[2Chr.28.5|5]] Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought \[them\] to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.

5: 

[[2Chr.28.6|6]] For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, \[which were\] all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.

6: 

[[2Chr.28.7|7]] And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king’s son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah \[that was\] next to the king.

7: 

[[2Chr.28.8|8]] And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.

8: 

[[2Chr.28.9|9]] But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name \[was\] Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage \[that\] reacheth up unto heaven.

9: 

[[2Chr.28.10|10]] And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: \[but are there\] not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?

10: 

[[2Chr.28.11|11]] Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD \[is\] upon you.

11: 

[[2Chr.28.12|12]] Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,

12: 

[[2Chr.28.13|13]] And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD \[already\], ye intend to add \[more\] to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and \[there is\] fierce wrath against Israel.

13: 

[[2Chr.28.14|14]] So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.

14: 

[[2Chr.28.15|15]] And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.

15:
