[[2Chr.34|2 Chronicles 34:14 - 2 Chronicles 34:21]]
*Hilkiah Finds the Book of the Law*

[[2Chr.34.14|14]] And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD \[given\] by Moses.

14: 

[[2Chr.34.15|15]] And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.

15: 

[[2Chr.34.16|16]] And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do \[it\].

16: 

[[2Chr.34.17|17]] And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.

17: 

[[2Chr.34.18|18]] Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.

18: 

[[2Chr.34.19|19]] And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.

19: 

[[2Chr.34.20|20]] And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king’s, saying,

20: 

[[2Chr.34.21|21]] Go, inquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great \[is\] the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.

21:
