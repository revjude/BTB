[[2Chr.21|2 Chronicles 21:1 - 2 Chronicles 21:7]]
*Jehoram Reigns in Judah*

[[2Chr.21.1|1]] Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.

1: 

[[2Chr.21.2|2]] And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these \[were\] the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.

2: 

[[2Chr.21.3|3]] And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he \[was\] the firstborn.

3: 

[[2Chr.21.4|4]] Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and \[divers\] also of the princes of Israel.

4: 

[[2Chr.21.5|5]] Jehoram \[was\] thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

5: 

[[2Chr.21.6|6]] And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought \[that which was\] evil in the eyes of the LORD.

6: 

[[2Chr.21.7|7]] Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.

7:
