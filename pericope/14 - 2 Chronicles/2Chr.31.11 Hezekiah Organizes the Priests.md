[[2Chr.31|2 Chronicles 31:11 - 2 Chronicles 31:21]]
*Hezekiah Organizes the Priests*

[[2Chr.31.11|11]] Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared \[them\],

11: 

[[2Chr.31.12|12]] And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated \[things\] faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite \[was\] ruler, and Shimei his brother \[was\] the next.

12: 

[[2Chr.31.13|13]] And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, \[were\] overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.

13: 

[[2Chr.31.14|14]] And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, \[was\] over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.

14: 

[[2Chr.31.15|15]] And next him \[were\] Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in \[their\] set office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small:

15: 

[[2Chr.31.16|16]] Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, \[even\] unto every one that entereth into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses;

16: 

[[2Chr.31.17|17]] Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses;

17: 

[[2Chr.31.18|18]] And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:

18: 

[[2Chr.31.19|19]] Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, \[which were\] in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.

19: 

[[2Chr.31.20|20]] And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought \[that which was\] good and right and truth before the LORD his God.

20: 

[[2Chr.31.21|21]] And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did \[it\] with all his heart, and prospered.

21:
