[[2Chr.30|2 Chronicles 30:13 - 2 Chronicles 30:27]]
*Hezekiah Celebrates the Passover*

[[2Chr.30.13|13]] And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.

13: 

[[2Chr.30.14|14]] And they arose and took away the altars that \[were\] in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast \[them\] into the brook Kidron.

14: 

[[2Chr.30.15|15]] Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth \[day\] of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.

15: 

[[2Chr.30.16|16]] And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, \[which they received\] of the hand of the Levites.

16: 

[[2Chr.30.17|17]] For \[there were\] many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one \[that was\] not clean, to sanctify \[them\] unto the LORD.

17: 

[[2Chr.30.18|18]] For a multitude of the people, \[even\] many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one

18: 

[[2Chr.30.19|19]] \[That\] prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though \[he be\] not \[cleansed\] according to the purification of the sanctuary.

19: 

[[2Chr.30.20|20]] And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.

20: 

[[2Chr.30.21|21]] And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, \[singing\] with loud instruments unto the LORD.

21: 

[[2Chr.30.22|22]] And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.

22: 

[[2Chr.30.23|23]] And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept \[other\] seven days with gladness.

23: 

[[2Chr.30.24|24]] For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.

24: 

[[2Chr.30.25|25]] And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.

25: 

[[2Chr.30.26|26]] So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel \[there was\] not the like in Jerusalem.

26: 

[[2Chr.30.27|27]] Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came \[up\] to his holy dwelling place, \[even\] unto heaven.

27:
