[[2Chr.20|2 Chronicles 20:14 - 2 Chronicles 20:19]]
*The Prophecy of Jahaziel*

[[2Chr.20.14|14]] Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation;

14: 

[[2Chr.20.15|15]] And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle \[is\] not yours, but God’s.

15: 

[[2Chr.20.16|16]] To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel.

16: 

[[2Chr.20.17|17]] Ye shall not \[need\] to fight in this \[battle\]: set yourselves, stand ye \[still\], and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD \[will be\] with you.

17: 

[[2Chr.20.18|18]] And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with \[his\] face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshipping the LORD.

18: 

[[2Chr.20.19|19]] And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high.

19:
