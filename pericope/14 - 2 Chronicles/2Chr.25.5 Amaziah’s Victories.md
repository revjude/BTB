[[2Chr.25|2 Chronicles 25:5 - 2 Chronicles 25:13]]
*Amaziah’s Victories*

[[2Chr.25.5|5]] Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of \[their\] fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice \[men, able\] to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.

5: 

[[2Chr.25.6|6]] He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver.

6: 

[[2Chr.25.7|7]] But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD \[is\] not with Israel, \[to wit, with\] all the children of Ephraim.

7: 

[[2Chr.25.8|8]] But if thou wilt go, do \[it\], be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.

8: 

[[2Chr.25.9|9]] And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.

9: 

[[2Chr.25.10|10]] Then Amaziah separated them, \[to wit\], the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.

10: 

[[2Chr.25.11|11]] And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.

11: 

[[2Chr.25.12|12]] And \[other\] ten thousand \[left\] alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.

12: 

[[2Chr.25.13|13]] But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.

13:
