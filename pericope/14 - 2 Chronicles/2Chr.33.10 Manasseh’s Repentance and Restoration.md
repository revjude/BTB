[[2Chr.33|2 Chronicles 33:10 - 2 Chronicles 33:20]]
*Manasseh’s Repentance and Restoration*

[[2Chr.33.10|10]] And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken.

10: 

[[2Chr.33.11|11]] Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.

11: 

[[2Chr.33.12|12]] And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,

12: 

[[2Chr.33.13|13]] And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he \[was\] God.

13: 

[[2Chr.33.14|14]] Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.

14: 

[[2Chr.33.15|15]] And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast \[them\] out of the city.

15: 

[[2Chr.33.16|16]] And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.

16: 

[[2Chr.33.17|17]] Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, \[yet\] unto the LORD their God only.

17: 

[[2Chr.33.18|18]] Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they \[are written\] in the book of the kings of Israel.

18: 

[[2Chr.33.19|19]] His prayer also, and \[how God\] was intreated of him, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they \[are\] written among the sayings of the seers.

19: 

[[2Chr.33.20|20]] So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.

20:
