[[2Chr.16|2 Chronicles 16:11 - 2 Chronicles 16:14]]
*The Death and Burial of Asa*

[[2Chr.16.11|11]] And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they \[are\] written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

11: 

[[2Chr.16.12|12]] And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease \[was\] exceeding \[great\]: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.

12: 

[[2Chr.16.13|13]] And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.

13: 

[[2Chr.16.14|14]] And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds \[of spices\] prepared by the apothecaries’ art: and they made a very great burning for him.

14:
