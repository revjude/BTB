[[2Chr.31|2 Chronicles 31:3 - 2 Chronicles 31:10]]
*Contributions for Worship*

[[2Chr.31.3|3]] \[He appointed\] also the king’s portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, \[to wit\], for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as \[it is\] written in the law of the LORD.

3: 

[[2Chr.31.4|4]] Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.

4: 

[[2Chr.31.5|5]] And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all \[things\] brought they in abundantly.

5: 

[[2Chr.31.6|6]] And \[concerning\] the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid \[them\] by heaps.

6: 

[[2Chr.31.7|7]] In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished \[them\] in the seventh month.

7: 

[[2Chr.31.8|8]] And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.

8: 

[[2Chr.31.9|9]] Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.

9: 

[[2Chr.31.10|10]] And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since \[the people\] began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left \[is\] this great store.

10:
