[[2Chr.18|2 Chronicles 18:28 - 2 Chronicles 18:34]]
*Ahab’s Defeat and Death*

[[2Chr.18.28|28]] So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.

28: 

[[2Chr.18.29|29]] And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.

29: 

[[2Chr.18.30|30]] Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that \[were\] with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.

30: 

[[2Chr.18.31|31]] And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It \[is\] the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them \[to depart\] from him.

31: 

[[2Chr.18.32|32]] For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.

32: 

[[2Chr.18.33|33]] And a \[certain\] man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.

33: 

[[2Chr.18.34|34]] And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed \[himself\] up in \[his\] chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.

34:
