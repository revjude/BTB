[[2Chr.24|2 Chronicles 24:23 - 2 Chronicles 24:27]]
*The Death of Joash*

[[2Chr.24.23|23]] And it came to pass at the end of the year, \[that\] the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.

23: 

[[2Chr.24.24|24]] For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.

24: 

[[2Chr.24.25|25]] And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.

25: 

[[2Chr.24.26|26]] And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.

26: 

[[2Chr.24.27|27]] Now \[concerning\] his sons, and the greatness of the burdens \[laid\] upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they \[are\] written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.

27:
