[[2Chr.28|2 Chronicles 28:16 - 2 Chronicles 28:27]]
*The Idolatry of Ahaz*

[[2Chr.28.16|16]] At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him.

16: 

[[2Chr.28.17|17]] For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.

17: 

[[2Chr.28.18|18]] The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.

18: 

[[2Chr.28.19|19]] For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD.

19: 

[[2Chr.28.20|20]] And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.

20: 

[[2Chr.28.21|21]] For Ahaz took away a portion \[out\] of the house of the LORD, and \[out\] of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave \[it\] unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.

21: 

[[2Chr.28.22|22]] And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this \[is that\] king Ahaz.

22: 

[[2Chr.28.23|23]] For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, \[therefore\] will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.

23: 

[[2Chr.28.24|24]] And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.

24: 

[[2Chr.28.25|25]] And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers.

25: 

[[2Chr.28.26|26]] Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they \[are\] written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

26: 

[[2Chr.28.27|27]] And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, \[even\] in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.

27:
