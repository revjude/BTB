29: 

[[2Chr.34.30|30]] And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.

30: 

[[2Chr.34.31|31]] And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.

[[2Chr.34.33|33]] And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that \[pertained\] to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, \[even\] to serve the LORD their God. \[And\] all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.
