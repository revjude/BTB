[[2Chr.21|2 Chronicles 21:12 - 2 Chronicles 21:15]]
*Elijah’s Letter to Jehoram*

[[2Chr.21.12|12]] And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,

12: 

[[2Chr.21.13|13]] But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father’s house, \[which were\] better than thyself:

13: 

[[2Chr.21.14|14]] Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:

14: 

[[2Chr.21.15|15]] And thou \[shalt have\] great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.

15:
