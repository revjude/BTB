[[2Chr.36|2 Chronicles 36:11 - 2 Chronicles 36:14]]
*Zedekiah Reigns in Judah*

[[2Chr.36.11|11]] Zedekiah \[was\] one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.

11: 

[[2Chr.36.12|12]] And he did \[that which was\] evil in the sight of the LORD his God, \[and\] humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet \[speaking\] from the mouth of the LORD.

12: 

[[2Chr.36.13|13]] And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.

13: 

[[2Chr.36.14|14]] Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.

14:
