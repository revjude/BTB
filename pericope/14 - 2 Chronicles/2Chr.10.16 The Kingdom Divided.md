[[2Chr.10|2 Chronicles 10:16 - 2 Chronicles 10:19]]
*The Kingdom Divided*

[[2Chr.10.16|16]] And when all Israel \[saw\] that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? and \[we have\] none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: \[and\] now, David, see to thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents.

16: 

[[2Chr.10.17|17]] But \[as for\] the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

17: 

[[2Chr.10.18|18]] Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that \[was\] over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to \[his\] chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.

18: 

[[2Chr.10.19|19]] And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.

19:
