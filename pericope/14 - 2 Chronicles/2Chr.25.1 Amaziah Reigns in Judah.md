[[2Chr.25|2 Chronicles 25:1 - 2 Chronicles 25:4]]
*Amaziah Reigns in Judah*

[[2Chr.25.1|1]] Amaziah \[was\] twenty and five years old \[when\] he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name \[was\] Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.

1: 

[[2Chr.25.2|2]] And he did \[that which was\] right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.

2: 

[[2Chr.25.3|3]] Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.

3: 

[[2Chr.25.4|4]] But he slew not their children, but \[did\] as \[it is\] written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.

4:
