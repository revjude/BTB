[[2Chr.23|2 Chronicles 23:12 - 2 Chronicles 23:15]]
*The Death of Athaliah*

[[2Chr.23.12|12]] Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:

12: 

[[2Chr.23.13|13]] And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.

13: 

[[2Chr.23.14|14]] Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.

14: 

[[2Chr.23.15|15]] So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king’s house, they slew her there.

15:
