[[2Chr.9|2 Chronicles 9:13 - 2 Chronicles 9:28]]
*Solomon’s Wealth and Splendor*

[[2Chr.9.13|13]] Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;

13: 

[[2Chr.9.14|14]] Beside \[that which\] chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.

14: 

[[2Chr.9.15|15]] And king Solomon made two hundred targets \[of\] beaten gold: six hundred \[shekels\] of beaten gold went to one target.

15: 

[[2Chr.9.16|16]] And three hundred shields \[made he of\] beaten gold: three hundred \[shekels\] of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.

16: 

[[2Chr.9.17|17]] Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.

17: 

[[2Chr.9.18|18]] And \[there were\] six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, \[which were\] fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the stays:

18: 

[[2Chr.9.19|19]] And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.

19: 

[[2Chr.9.20|20]] And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon \[were of\] gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon \[were of\] pure gold: none \[were of\] silver; it was \[not\] any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon.

20: 

[[2Chr.9.21|21]] For the king’s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

21: 

[[2Chr.9.22|22]] And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.

22: 

[[2Chr.9.23|23]] And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.

23: 

[[2Chr.9.24|24]] And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.

24: 

[[2Chr.9.25|25]] And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.

25: 

[[2Chr.9.26|26]] And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.

26: 

[[2Chr.9.27|27]] And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that \[are\] in the low plains in abundance.

27: 

[[2Chr.9.28|28]] And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands.
