[[2Chr.6|2 Chronicles 6:1 - 2 Chronicles 6:11]]
*Solomon Blesses the LORD*

[[2Chr.6.1|1]] Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.

1: 

[[2Chr.6.2|2]] But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever.

2: 

[[2Chr.6.3|3]] And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.

3: 

[[2Chr.6.4|4]] And he said, Blessed \[be\] the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled \[that\] which he spake with his mouth to my father David, saying,

4: 

[[2Chr.6.5|5]] Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:

5: 

[[2Chr.6.6|6]] But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.

6: 

[[2Chr.6.7|7]] Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

7: 

[[2Chr.6.8|8]] But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine heart:

8: 

[[2Chr.6.9|9]] Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.

9: 

[[2Chr.6.10|10]] The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

10: 

[[2Chr.6.11|11]] And in it have I put the ark, wherein \[is\] the covenant of the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.

11:
