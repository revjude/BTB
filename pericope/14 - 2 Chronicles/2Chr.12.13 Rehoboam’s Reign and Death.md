[[2Chr.12|2 Chronicles 12:13 - 2 Chronicles 12:16]]
*Rehoboam’s Reign and Death*

[[2Chr.12.13|13]] So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam \[was\] one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother’s name \[was\] Naamah an Ammonitess.

13: 

[[2Chr.12.14|14]] And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.

14: 

[[2Chr.12.15|15]] Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, \[are\] they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And \[there were\] wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.

15: 

[[2Chr.12.16|16]] And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.

16:
