[[2Chr.21|2 Chronicles 21:8 - 2 Chronicles 21:11]]
*Edom and Libnah Rebel*

[[2Chr.21.8|8]] In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king.

8: 

[[2Chr.21.9|9]] Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.

9: 

[[2Chr.21.10|10]] So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time \[also\] did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.

10: 

[[2Chr.21.11|11]] Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah \[thereto\].

11:
