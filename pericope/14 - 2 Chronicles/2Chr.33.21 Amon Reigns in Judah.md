[[2Chr.33|2 Chronicles 33:21 - 2 Chronicles 33:25]]
*Amon Reigns in Judah*

[[2Chr.33.21|21]] Amon \[was\] two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem.

21: 

[[2Chr.33.22|22]] But he did \[that which was\] evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;

22: 

[[2Chr.33.23|23]] And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.

23: 

[[2Chr.33.24|24]] And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.

24: 

[[2Chr.33.25|25]] But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.

25:
