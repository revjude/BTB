[[2Chr.2|2 Chronicles 2:1 - 2 Chronicles 2:10]]
*Preparations for the Temple*

[[2Chr.2.1|1]] And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.

1: 

[[2Chr.2.2|2]] And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.

2: 

[[2Chr.2.3|3]] And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, \[even so deal with me\].

3: 

[[2Chr.2.4|4]] Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate \[it\] to him, \[and\] to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This \[is an ordinance\] for ever to Israel.

4: 

[[2Chr.2.5|5]] And the house which I build \[is\] great: for great \[is\] our God above all gods.

5: 

[[2Chr.2.6|6]] But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who \[am\] I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?

6: 

[[2Chr.2.7|7]] Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that \[are\] with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.

7: 

[[2Chr.2.8|8]] Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants \[shall be\] with thy servants,

8: 

[[2Chr.2.9|9]] Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build \[shall be\] wonderful great.

9: 

[[2Chr.2.10|10]] And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.

10:
