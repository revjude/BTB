[[2Chr.36|2 Chronicles 36:15 - 2 Chronicles 36:21]]
*The Fall of Jerusalem*

[[2Chr.36.15|15]] And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:

15: 

[[2Chr.36.16|16]] But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till \[there was\] no remedy.

16: 

[[2Chr.36.17|17]] Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave \[them\] all into his hand.

17: 

[[2Chr.36.18|18]] And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all \[these\] he brought to Babylon.

18: 

[[2Chr.36.19|19]] And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.

19: 

[[2Chr.36.20|20]] And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:

20: 

[[2Chr.36.21|21]] To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: \[for\] as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.

21:
