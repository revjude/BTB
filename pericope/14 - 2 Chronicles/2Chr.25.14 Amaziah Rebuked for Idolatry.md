[[2Chr.25|2 Chronicles 25:14 - 2 Chronicles 25:16]]
*Amaziah Rebuked for Idolatry*

[[2Chr.25.14|14]] Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up \[to be\] his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.

14: 

[[2Chr.25.15|15]] Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?

15: 

[[2Chr.25.16|16]] And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that \[the king\] said unto him, Art thou made of the king’s counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.

16:
