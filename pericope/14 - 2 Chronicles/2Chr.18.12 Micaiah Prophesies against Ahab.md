[[2Chr.18|2 Chronicles 18:12 - 2 Chronicles 18:27]]
*Micaiah Prophesies against Ahab*

[[2Chr.18.12|12]] And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets \[declare\] good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.

12: 

[[2Chr.18.13|13]] And Micaiah said, \[As\] the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.

13: 

[[2Chr.18.14|14]] And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.

14: 

[[2Chr.18.15|15]] And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?

15: 

[[2Chr.18.16|16]] Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return \[therefore\] every man to his house in peace.

16: 

[[2Chr.18.17|17]] And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee \[that\] he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?

17: 

[[2Chr.18.18|18]] Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and \[on\] his left.

18: 

[[2Chr.18.19|19]] And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.

19: 

[[2Chr.18.20|20]] Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?

20: 

[[2Chr.18.21|21]] And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And \[the LORD\] said, Thou shalt entice \[him\], and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do \[even\] so.

21: 

[[2Chr.18.22|22]] Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.

22: 

[[2Chr.18.23|23]] Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?

23: 

[[2Chr.18.24|24]] And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.

24: 

[[2Chr.18.25|25]] Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;

25: 

[[2Chr.18.26|26]] And say, Thus saith the king, Put this \[fellow\] in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.

26: 

[[2Chr.18.27|27]] And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, \[then\] hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.

27:
