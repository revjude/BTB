[[2Chr.32|2 Chronicles 32:24 - 2 Chronicles 32:31]]
*Hezekiah’s Illness and Recovery*

[[2Chr.32.24|24]] In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.

24: 

[[2Chr.32.25|25]] But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit \[done\] unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.

25: 

[[2Chr.32.26|26]] Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, \[both\] he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.

26: 

[[2Chr.32.27|27]] And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;

27: 

[[2Chr.32.28|28]] Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.

28: 

[[2Chr.32.29|29]] Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.

29: 

[[2Chr.32.30|30]] This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.

30: 

[[2Chr.32.31|31]] Howbeit in \[the business of\] the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was \[done\] in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all \[that was\] in his heart.

31:
