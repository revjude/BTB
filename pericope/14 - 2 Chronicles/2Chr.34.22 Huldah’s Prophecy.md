[[2Chr.34|2 Chronicles 34:22 - 2 Chronicles 34:28]]
*Huldah’s Prophecy*

[[2Chr.34.22|22]] And Hilkiah, and \[they\] that the king \[had appointed\], went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that \[effect\].

22: 

[[2Chr.34.23|23]] And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me,

23: 

[[2Chr.34.24|24]] Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, \[even\] all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah:

24: 

[[2Chr.34.25|25]] Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.

25: 

[[2Chr.34.26|26]] And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel \[concerning\] the words which thou hast heard;

26: 

[[2Chr.34.27|27]] Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard \[thee\] also, saith the LORD.

27: 

[[2Chr.34.28|28]] Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.

28:
