[[2Chr.25|2 Chronicles 25:17 - 2 Chronicles 25:24]]
*Jehoash Defeats Amaziah*

[[2Chr.25.17|17]] Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.

17: 

[[2Chr.25.18|18]] And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that \[was\] in Lebanon sent to the cedar that \[was\] in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that \[was\] in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.

18: 

[[2Chr.25.19|19]] Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to \[thine\] hurt, that thou shouldest fall, \[even\] thou, and Judah with thee?

19: 

[[2Chr.25.20|20]] But Amaziah would not hear; for it \[came\] of God, that he might deliver them into the hand \[of their enemies\], because they sought after the gods of Edom.

20: 

[[2Chr.25.21|21]] So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, \[both\] he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which \[belongeth\] to Judah.

21: 

[[2Chr.25.22|22]] And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.

22: 

[[2Chr.25.23|23]] And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

23: 

[[2Chr.25.24|24]] And \[he took\] all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.

24:
