[[2Chr.34|2 Chronicles 34:8 - 2 Chronicles 34:13]]
*Josiah Repairs the Temple*

[[2Chr.34.8|8]] Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.

8: 

[[2Chr.34.9|9]] And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.

9: 

[[2Chr.34.10|10]] And they put \[it\] in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house:

10: 

[[2Chr.34.11|11]] Even to the artificers and builders gave they \[it\], to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.

11: 

[[2Chr.34.12|12]] And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them \[were\] Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set \[it\] forward; and \[other of\] the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick.

12: 

[[2Chr.34.13|13]] Also \[they were\] over the bearers of burdens, and \[were\] overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites \[there were\] scribes, and officers, and porters.

13:
