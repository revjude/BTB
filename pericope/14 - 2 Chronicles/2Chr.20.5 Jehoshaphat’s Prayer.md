[[2Chr.20|2 Chronicles 20:5 - 2 Chronicles 20:13]]
*Jehoshaphat’s Prayer*

[[2Chr.20.5|5]] And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,

5: 

[[2Chr.20.6|6]] And said, O LORD God of our fathers, \[art\] not thou God in heaven? and rulest \[not\] thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand \[is there not\] power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?

6: 

[[2Chr.20.7|7]] \[Art\] not thou our God, \[who\] didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?

7: 

[[2Chr.20.8|8]] And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying,

8: 

[[2Chr.20.9|9]] If, \[when\] evil cometh upon us, \[as\] the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy name \[is\] in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.

9: 

[[2Chr.20.10|10]] And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;

10: 

[[2Chr.20.11|11]] Behold, \[I say, how\] they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.

11: 

[[2Chr.20.12|12]] O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes \[are\] upon thee.

12: 

[[2Chr.20.13|13]] And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.

13:
