[[2Chr.24|2 Chronicles 24:1 - 2 Chronicles 24:14]]
*Joash Repairs the Temple*

[[2Chr.24.1|1]] Joash \[was\] seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also \[was\] Zibiah of Beersheba.

1: 

[[2Chr.24.2|2]] And Joash did \[that which was\] right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.

2: 

[[2Chr.24.3|3]] And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.

3: 

[[2Chr.24.4|4]] And it came to pass after this, \[that\] Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD.

4: 

[[2Chr.24.5|5]] And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened \[it\] not.

5: 

[[2Chr.24.6|6]] And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, \[according to the commandment\] of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?

6: 

[[2Chr.24.7|7]] For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.

7: 

[[2Chr.24.8|8]] And at the king’s commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.

8: 

[[2Chr.24.9|9]] And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection \[that\] Moses the servant of God \[laid\] upon Israel in the wilderness.

9: 

[[2Chr.24.10|10]] And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.

10: 

[[2Chr.24.11|11]] Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king’s office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that \[there was\] much money, the king’s scribe and the high priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.

11: 

[[2Chr.24.12|12]] And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.

12: 

[[2Chr.24.13|13]] So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.

13: 

[[2Chr.24.14|14]] And when they had finished \[it\], they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, \[even\] vessels to minister, and to offer \[withal\], and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.

14:
