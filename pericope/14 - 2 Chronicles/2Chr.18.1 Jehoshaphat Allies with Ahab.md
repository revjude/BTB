[[2Chr.18|2 Chronicles 18:1 - 2 Chronicles 18:11]]
*Jehoshaphat Allies with Ahab*

[[2Chr.18.1|1]] Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab.

1: 

[[2Chr.18.2|2]] And after \[certain\] years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that \[he had\] with him, and persuaded him to go up \[with him\] to Ramothgilead.

2: 

[[2Chr.18.3|3]] And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I \[am\] as thou \[art\], and my people as thy people; and \[we will be\] with thee in the war.

3: 

[[2Chr.18.4|4]] And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.

4: 

[[2Chr.18.5|5]] Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver \[it\] into the king’s hand.

5: 

[[2Chr.18.6|6]] But Jehoshaphat said, \[Is there\] not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might inquire of him?

6: 

[[2Chr.18.7|7]] And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, \[There is\] yet one man, by whom we may inquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same \[is\] Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.

7: 

[[2Chr.18.8|8]] And the king of Israel called for one \[of his\] officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.

8: 

[[2Chr.18.9|9]] And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in \[their\] robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.

9: 

[[2Chr.18.10|10]] And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.

10: 

[[2Chr.18.11|11]] And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver \[it\] into the hand of the king.

11:
