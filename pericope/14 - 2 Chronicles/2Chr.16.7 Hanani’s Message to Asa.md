[[2Chr.16|2 Chronicles 16:7 - 2 Chronicles 16:10]]
*Hanani’s Message to Asa*

[[2Chr.16.7|7]] And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.

7: 

[[2Chr.16.8|8]] Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.

8: 

[[2Chr.16.9|9]] For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of \[them\] whose heart \[is\] perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.

9: 

[[2Chr.16.10|10]] Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for \[he was\] in a rage with him because of this \[thing\]. And Asa oppressed \[some\] of the people the same time.

10:
