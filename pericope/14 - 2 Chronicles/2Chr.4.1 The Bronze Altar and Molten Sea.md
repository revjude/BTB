[[2Chr.4|2 Chronicles 4:1 - 2 Chronicles 4:5]]
*The Bronze Altar and Molten Sea*

[[2Chr.4.1|1]] Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.

1: 

[[2Chr.4.2|2]] Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.

2: 

[[2Chr.4.3|3]] And under it \[was\] the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen \[were\] cast, when it was cast.

3: 

[[2Chr.4.4|4]] It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea \[was set\] above upon them, and all their hinder parts \[were\] inward.

4: 

[[2Chr.4.5|5]] And the thickness of it \[was\] an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; \[and\] it received and held three thousand baths.

5:
