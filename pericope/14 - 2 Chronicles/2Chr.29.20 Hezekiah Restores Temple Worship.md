[[2Chr.29|2 Chronicles 29:20 - 2 Chronicles 29:36]]
*Hezekiah Restores Temple Worship*

[[2Chr.29.20|20]] Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.

20: 

[[2Chr.29.21|21]] And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer \[them\] on the altar of the LORD.

21: 

[[2Chr.29.22|22]] So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled \[it\] on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.

22: 

[[2Chr.29.23|23]] And they brought forth the he goats \[for\] the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:

23: 

[[2Chr.29.24|24]] And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded \[that\] the burnt offering and the sin offering \[should be made\] for all Israel.

24: 

[[2Chr.29.25|25]] And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king’s seer, and Nathan the prophet: for \[so was\] the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.

25: 

[[2Chr.29.26|26]] And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.

26: 

[[2Chr.29.27|27]] And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began \[also\] with the trumpets, and with the instruments \[ordained\] by David king of Israel.

27: 

[[2Chr.29.28|28]] And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: \[and\] all \[this continued\] until the burnt offering was finished.

28: 

[[2Chr.29.29|29]] And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.

29: 

[[2Chr.29.30|30]] Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.

30: 

[[2Chr.29.31|31]] Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.

31: 

[[2Chr.29.32|32]] And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, \[and\] two hundred lambs: all these \[were\] for a burnt offering to the LORD.

32: 

[[2Chr.29.33|33]] And the consecrated things \[were\] six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.

33: 

[[2Chr.29.34|34]] But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the \[other\] priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites \[were\] more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.

34: 

[[2Chr.29.35|35]] And also the burnt offerings \[were\] in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for \[every\] burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.

35: 

[[2Chr.29.36|36]] And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was \[done\] suddenly.

36:
