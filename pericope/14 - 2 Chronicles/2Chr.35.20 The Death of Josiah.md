[[2Chr.35|2 Chronicles 35:20 - 2 Chronicles 35:24]]
*The Death of Josiah*

[[2Chr.35.20|20]] After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.

20: 

[[2Chr.35.21|21]] But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? \[I come\] not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from \[meddling with\] God, who \[is\] with me, that he destroy thee not.

21: 

[[2Chr.35.22|22]] Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.

22: 

[[2Chr.35.23|23]] And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.

23: 

[[2Chr.35.24|24]] His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in \[one of\] the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.

24:
