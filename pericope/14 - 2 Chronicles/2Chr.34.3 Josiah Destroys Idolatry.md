[[2Chr.34|2 Chronicles 34:3 - 2 Chronicles 34:7]]
*Josiah Destroys Idolatry*

[[2Chr.34.3|3]] For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.

3: 

[[2Chr.34.4|4]] And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that \[were\] on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust \[of them\], and strowed \[it\] upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.

4: 

[[2Chr.34.5|5]] And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.

5: 

[[2Chr.34.6|6]] And \[so did he\] in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.

6: 

[[2Chr.34.7|7]] And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.

7:
