[[2Chr.23|2 Chronicles 23:1 - 2 Chronicles 23:11]]
*Joash Anointed King of Judah*

[[2Chr.23.1|1]] And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.

1: 

[[2Chr.23.2|2]] And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.

2: 

[[2Chr.23.3|3]] And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.

3: 

[[2Chr.23.4|4]] This \[is\] the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, \[shall be\] porters of the doors;

4: 

[[2Chr.23.5|5]] And a third part \[shall be\] at the king’s house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people \[shall be\] in the courts of the house of the LORD.

5: 

[[2Chr.23.6|6]] But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they \[are\] holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.

6: 

[[2Chr.23.7|7]] And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever \[else\] cometh into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.

7: 

[[2Chr.23.8|8]] So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go \[out\] on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.

8: 

[[2Chr.23.9|9]] Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that \[had been\] king David’s, which \[were\] in the house of God.

9: 

[[2Chr.23.10|10]] And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.

10: 

[[2Chr.23.11|11]] Then they brought out the king’s son, and put upon him the crown, and \[gave him\] the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.

11:
