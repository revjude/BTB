[[2Chr.12|2 Chronicles 12:1 - 2 Chronicles 12:12]]
*Shishak Raids Jerusalem*

[[2Chr.12.1|1]] And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.

1: 

[[2Chr.12.2|2]] And it came to pass, \[that\] in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,

2: 

[[2Chr.12.3|3]] With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people \[were\] without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.

3: 

[[2Chr.12.4|4]] And he took the fenced cities which \[pertained\] to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.

4: 

[[2Chr.12.5|5]] Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and \[to\] the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.

5: 

[[2Chr.12.6|6]] Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD \[is\] righteous.

6: 

[[2Chr.12.7|7]] And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; \[therefore\] I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.

7: 

[[2Chr.12.8|8]] Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.

8: 

[[2Chr.12.9|9]] So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.

9: 

[[2Chr.12.10|10]] Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed \[them\] to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king’s house.

10: 

[[2Chr.12.11|11]] And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.

11: 

[[2Chr.12.12|12]] And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy \[him\] altogether: and also in Judah things went well.

12:
