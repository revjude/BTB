[[2Chr.24|2 Chronicles 24:17 - 2 Chronicles 24:22]]
*The Wickedness of Joash*

[[2Chr.24.17|17]] Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.

17: 

[[2Chr.24.18|18]] And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.

18: 

[[2Chr.24.19|19]] Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.

19: 

[[2Chr.24.20|20]] And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you.

20: 

[[2Chr.24.21|21]] And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.

21: 

[[2Chr.24.22|22]] Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon \[it\], and require \[it\].

22:
