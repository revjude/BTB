[[2Chr.9|2 Chronicles 9:1 - 2 Chronicles 9:12]]
*The Queen of Sheba*

[[2Chr.9.1|1]] And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.

1: 

[[2Chr.9.2|2]] And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.

2: 

[[2Chr.9.3|3]] And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,

3: 

[[2Chr.9.4|4]] And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.

4: 

[[2Chr.9.5|5]] And she said to the king, \[It was\] a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:

5: 

[[2Chr.9.6|6]] Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen \[it\]: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: \[for\] thou exceedest the fame that I heard.

6: 

[[2Chr.9.7|7]] Happy \[are\] thy men, and happy \[are\] these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.

7: 

[[2Chr.9.8|8]] Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, \[to be\] king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.

8: 

[[2Chr.9.9|9]] And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.

9: 

[[2Chr.9.10|10]] And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.

10: 

[[2Chr.9.11|11]] And the king made \[of\] the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king’s palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.

11: 

[[2Chr.9.12|12]] And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside \[that\] which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.

12:
