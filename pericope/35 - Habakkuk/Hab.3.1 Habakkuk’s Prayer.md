[[Hab.3|Habakkuk 3:1 - Habakkuk 3:16]]
*Habakkuk’s Prayer*

[[Hab.3.1|1]] A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.

1: 

[[Hab.3.2|2]] O LORD, I have heard thy speech, \[and\] was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.

2: 

[[Hab.3.3|3]] God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.

3: 

[[Hab.3.4|4]] And \[his\] brightness was as the light; he had horns \[coming\] out of his hand: and there \[was\] the hiding of his power.

4: 

[[Hab.3.5|5]] Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.

5: 

[[Hab.3.6|6]] He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways \[are\] everlasting.

6: 

[[Hab.3.7|7]] I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: \[and\] the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.

7: 

[[Hab.3.8|8]] Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? \[was\] thine anger against the rivers? \[was\] thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses \[and\] thy chariots of salvation?

8: 

[[Hab.3.9|9]] Thy bow was made quite naked, \[according\] to the oaths of the tribes, \[even thy\] word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.

9: 

[[Hab.3.10|10]] The mountains saw thee, \[and\] they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, \[and\] lifted up his hands on high.

10: 

[[Hab.3.11|11]] The sun \[and\] moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, \[and\] at the shining of thy glittering spear.

11: 

[[Hab.3.12|12]] Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.

12: 

[[Hab.3.13|13]] Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, \[even\] for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.

13: 

[[Hab.3.14|14]] Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing \[was\] as to devour the poor secretly.

14: 

[[Hab.3.15|15]] Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, \[through\] the heap of great waters.

15: 

[[Hab.3.16|16]] When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.

16:
