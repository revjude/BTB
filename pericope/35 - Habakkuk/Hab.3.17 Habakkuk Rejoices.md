[[Hab.3|Habakkuk 3:17 - Habakkuk 3:19]]
*Habakkuk Rejoices*

[[Hab.3.17|17]] Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither \[shall\] fruit \[be\] in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and \[there shall be\] no herd in the stalls:

17: 

[[Hab.3.18|18]] Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.

18: 

[[Hab.3.19|19]] The LORD God \[is\] my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds’ \[feet\], and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.

19:
