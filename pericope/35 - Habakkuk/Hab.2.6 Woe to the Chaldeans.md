[[Hab.2|Habakkuk 2:6 - Habakkuk 2:20]]
*Woe to the Chaldeans*

[[Hab.2.6|6]] Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth \[that which is\] not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!

6: 

[[Hab.2.7|7]] Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?

7: 

[[Hab.2.8|8]] Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men’s blood, and \[for\] the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.

8: 

[[Hab.2.9|9]] Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!

9: 

[[Hab.2.10|10]] Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned \[against\] thy soul.

10: 

[[Hab.2.11|11]] For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.

11: 

[[Hab.2.12|12]] Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!

12: 

[[Hab.2.13|13]] Behold, \[is it\] not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?

13: 

[[Hab.2.14|14]] For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.

14: 

[[Hab.2.15|15]] Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to \[him\], and makest \[him\] drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!

15: 

[[Hab.2.16|16]] Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD’S right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing \[shall be\] on thy glory.

16: 

[[Hab.2.17|17]] For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, \[which\] made them afraid, because of men’s blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.

17: 

[[Hab.2.18|18]] What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?

18: 

[[Hab.2.19|19]] Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it \[is\] laid over with gold and silver, and \[there is\] no breath at all in the midst of it.

19: 

[[Hab.2.20|20]] But the LORD \[is\] in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.

20:
