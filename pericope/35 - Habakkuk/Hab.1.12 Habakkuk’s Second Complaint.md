[[Hab.1|Habakkuk 1:12 - Habakkuk 1:17]]
*Habakkuk’s Second Complaint*

[[Hab.1.12|12]] \[Art\] thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.

12: 

[[Hab.1.13|13]] \[Thou art\] of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, \[and\] holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth \[the man that is\] more righteous than he?

13: 

[[Hab.1.14|14]] And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, \[that have\] no ruler over them?

14: 

[[Hab.1.15|15]] They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.

15: 

[[Hab.1.16|16]] Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion \[is\] fat, and their meat plenteous.

16: 

[[Hab.1.17|17]] Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?

17:
