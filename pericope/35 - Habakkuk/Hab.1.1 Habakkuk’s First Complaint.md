1: 

[[Hab.1.2|2]] O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! \[even\] cry out unto thee \[of\] violence, and thou wilt not save!

3: 

[[Hab.1.4|4]] Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.

4:
