[[Hab.2|Habakkuk 2:1 - Habakkuk 2:5]]
*The LORD Answers Again*

[[Hab.2.1|1]] I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.

1: 

[[Hab.2.2|2]] And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make \[it\] plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.

2: 

[[Hab.2.3|3]] For the vision \[is\] yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.

3: 

[[Hab.2.4|4]] Behold, his soul \[which\] is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.

4: 

[[Hab.2.5|5]] Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, \[he is\] a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and \[is\] as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:

5:
