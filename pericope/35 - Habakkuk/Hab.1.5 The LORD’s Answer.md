[[Hab.1|Habakkuk 1:5 - Habakkuk 1:11]]
*The LORD’s Answer*

[[Hab.1.5|5]] Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for \[I\] will work a work in your days, \[which\] ye will not believe, though it be told \[you\].

5: 

[[Hab.1.6|6]] For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, \[that\] bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces \[that are\] not theirs.

6: 

[[Hab.1.7|7]] They \[are\] terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.

7: 

[[Hab.1.8|8]] Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle \[that\] hasteth to eat.

8: 

[[Hab.1.9|9]] They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up \[as\] the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.

9: 

[[Hab.1.10|10]] And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.

10: 

[[Hab.1.11|11]] Then shall \[his\] mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, \[imputing\] this his power unto his god.

11:
