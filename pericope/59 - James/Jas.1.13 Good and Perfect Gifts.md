[[Jas.1|James 1:13 - James 1:18]]
*Good and Perfect Gifts*

[[Jas.1.13|13]] Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:

13: 

[[Jas.1.14|14]] But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.

14: 

[[Jas.1.15|15]] Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.

15: 

[[Jas.1.16|16]] Do not err, my beloved brethren.

16: 

[[Jas.1.17|17]] Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.

17: 

[[Jas.1.18|18]] Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.

18:
