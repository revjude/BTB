[[Jas.4|James 4:1 - James 4:6]]
*A Warning against Pride*

[[Jas.4.1|1]] From whence \[come\] wars and fightings among you? \[come they\] not hence, \[even\] of your lusts that war in your members?

1: 

[[Jas.4.2|2]] Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.

2: 

[[Jas.4.3|3]] Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume \[it\] upon your lusts.

3: 

[[Jas.4.4|4]] Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.

4: 

[[Jas.4.5|5]] Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?

5: 

[[Jas.4.6|6]] But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.

6:
