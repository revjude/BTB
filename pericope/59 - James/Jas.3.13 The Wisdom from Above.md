[[Jas.3|James 3:13 - James 3:18]]
*The Wisdom from Above*

[[Jas.3.13|13]] Who \[is\] a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.

13: 

[[Jas.3.14|14]] But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.

14: 

[[Jas.3.15|15]] This wisdom descendeth not from above, but \[is\] earthly, sensual, devilish.

15: 

[[Jas.3.16|16]] For where envying and strife \[is\], there \[is\] confusion and every evil work.

16: 

[[Jas.3.17|17]] But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, \[and\] easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.

17: 

[[Jas.3.18|18]] And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.

18:
