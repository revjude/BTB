[[Jas.2|James 2:14 - James 2:26]]
*Faith and Works*

[[Jas.2.14|14]] What \[doth it\] profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?

14: 

[[Jas.2.15|15]] If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,

15: 

[[Jas.2.16|16]] And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be \[ye\] warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what \[doth it\] profit?

16: 

[[Jas.2.17|17]] Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.

17: 

[[Jas.2.18|18]] Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.

18: 

[[Jas.2.19|19]] Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.

19: 

[[Jas.2.20|20]] But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?

20: 

[[Jas.2.21|21]] Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?

21: 

[[Jas.2.22|22]] Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?

22: 

[[Jas.2.23|23]] And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.

23: 

[[Jas.2.24|24]] Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.

24: 

[[Jas.2.25|25]] Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent \[them\] out another way?

25: 

[[Jas.2.26|26]] For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.

26:
