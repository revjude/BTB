[[Jas.4|James 4:7 - James 4:12]]
*Drawing Near to God*

[[Jas.4.7|7]] Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.

7: 

[[Jas.4.8|8]] Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse \[your\] hands, \[ye\] sinners; and purify \[your\] hearts, \[ye\] double minded.

8: 

[[Jas.4.9|9]] Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and \[your\] joy to heaviness.

9: 

[[Jas.4.10|10]] Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.

10: 

[[Jas.4.11|11]] Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of \[his\] brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.

11: 

[[Jas.4.12|12]] There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?

12:
