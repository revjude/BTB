[[Jas.5|James 5:7 - James 5:12]]
*Patience in Suffering*

[[Jas.5.7|7]] Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.

7: 

[[Jas.5.8|8]] Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.

8: 

[[Jas.5.9|9]] Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.

9: 

[[Jas.5.10|10]] Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.

10: 

[[Jas.5.11|11]] Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.

11: 

[[Jas.5.12|12]] But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and \[your\] nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.

12:
