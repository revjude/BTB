[[Jas.5|James 5:13 - James 5:18]]
*The Prayer of Faith*

[[Jas.5.13|13]] Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.

13: 

[[Jas.5.14|14]] Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:

14: 

[[Jas.5.15|15]] And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.

15: 

[[Jas.5.16|16]] Confess \[your\] faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

16: 

[[Jas.5.17|17]] Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.

17: 

[[Jas.5.18|18]] And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.

18:
