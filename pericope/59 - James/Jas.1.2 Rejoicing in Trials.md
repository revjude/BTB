[[Jas.1|James 1:2 - James 1:12]]
*Rejoicing in Trials*

[[Jas.1.2|2]] My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;

2: 

[[Jas.1.3|3]] Knowing \[this\], that the trying of your faith worketh patience.

3: 

[[Jas.1.4|4]] But let patience have \[her\] perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.

4: 

[[Jas.1.5|5]] If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all \[men\] liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.

5: 

[[Jas.1.6|6]] But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.

6: 

[[Jas.1.7|7]] For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.

7: 

[[Jas.1.8|8]] A double minded man \[is\] unstable in all his ways.

8: 

[[Jas.1.9|9]] Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:

9: 

[[Jas.1.10|10]] But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.

10: 

[[Jas.1.11|11]] For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.

11: 

[[Jas.1.12|12]] Blessed \[is\] the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.

12:
