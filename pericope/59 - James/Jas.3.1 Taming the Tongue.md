[[Jas.3|James 3:1 - James 3:12]]
*Taming the Tongue*

[[Jas.3.1|1]] My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.

1: 

[[Jas.3.2|2]] For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same \[is\] a perfect man, \[and\] able also to bridle the whole body.

2: 

[[Jas.3.3|3]] Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.

3: 

[[Jas.3.4|4]] Behold also the ships, which though \[they be\] so great, and \[are\] driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.

4: 

[[Jas.3.5|5]] Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!

5: 

[[Jas.3.6|6]] And the tongue \[is\] a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.

6: 

[[Jas.3.7|7]] For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:

7: 

[[Jas.3.8|8]] But the tongue can no man tame; \[it is\] an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.

8: 

[[Jas.3.9|9]] Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.

9: 

[[Jas.3.10|10]] Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.

10: 

[[Jas.3.11|11]] Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet \[water\] and bitter?

11: 

[[Jas.3.12|12]] Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so \[can\] no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.

12:
