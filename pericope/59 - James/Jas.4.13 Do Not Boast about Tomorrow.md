[[Jas.4|James 4:13 - James 4:17]]
*Do Not Boast about Tomorrow*

[[Jas.4.13|13]] Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:

13: 

[[Jas.4.14|14]] Whereas ye know not what \[shall be\] on the morrow. For what \[is\] your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.

14: 

[[Jas.4.15|15]] For that ye \[ought\] to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.

15: 

[[Jas.4.16|16]] But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.

16: 

[[Jas.4.17|17]] Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth \[it\] not, to him it is sin.

17:
