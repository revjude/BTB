[[Jas.5|James 5:1 - James 5:6]]
*A Warning to the Rich*

[[Jas.5.1|1]] Go to now, \[ye\] rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon \[you\].

1: 

[[Jas.5.2|2]] Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.

2: 

[[Jas.5.3|3]] Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.

3: 

[[Jas.5.4|4]] Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.

4: 

[[Jas.5.5|5]] Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.

5: 

[[Jas.5.6|6]] Ye have condemned \[and\] killed the just; \[and\] he doth not resist you.

6:
