[[Jas.1|James 1:19 - James 1:27]]
*Hearing and Doing*

[[Jas.1.19|19]] Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:

19: 

[[Jas.1.20|20]] For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.

20: 

[[Jas.1.21|21]] Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.

21: 

[[Jas.1.22|22]] But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.

22: 

[[Jas.1.23|23]] For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:

23: 

[[Jas.1.24|24]] For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.

24: 

[[Jas.1.25|25]] But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth \[therein\], he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.

25: 

[[Jas.1.26|26]] If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion \[is\] vain.

26: 

[[Jas.1.27|27]] Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, \[and\] to keep himself unspotted from the world.

27:
