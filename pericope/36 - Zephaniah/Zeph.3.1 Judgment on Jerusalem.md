[[Zeph.3|Zephaniah 3:1 - Zephaniah 3:5]]
*Judgment on Jerusalem*

[[Zeph.3.1|1]] Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!

1: 

[[Zeph.3.2|2]] She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.

2: 

[[Zeph.3.3|3]] Her princes within her \[are\] roaring lions; her judges \[are\] evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.

3: 

[[Zeph.3.4|4]] Her prophets \[are\] light \[and\] treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.

4: 

[[Zeph.3.5|5]] The just LORD \[is\] in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.

5:
