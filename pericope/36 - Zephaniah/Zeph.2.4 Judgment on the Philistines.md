[[Zeph.2|Zephaniah 2:4 - Zephaniah 2:7]]
*Judgment on the Philistines*

[[Zeph.2.4|4]] For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.

4: 

[[Zeph.2.5|5]] Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD \[is\] against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.

5: 

[[Zeph.2.6|6]] And the sea coast shall be dwellings \[and\] cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks.

6: 

[[Zeph.2.7|7]] And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away their captivity.

7:
