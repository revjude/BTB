[[Zeph.2|Zephaniah 2:8 - Zephaniah 2:11]]
*Judgment on Moab and Ammon*

[[Zeph.2.8|8]] I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified \[themselves\] against their border.

8: 

[[Zeph.2.9|9]] Therefore \[as\] I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, \[even\] the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.

9: 

[[Zeph.2.10|10]] This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified \[themselves\] against the people of the LORD of hosts.

10: 

[[Zeph.2.11|11]] The LORD \[will be\] terrible unto them: for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and \[men\] shall worship him, every one from his place, \[even\] all the isles of the heathen.

11:
