[[Zeph.3|Zephaniah 3:6 - Zephaniah 3:8]]
*Purification of the Nations*

[[Zeph.3.6|6]] I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.

6: 

[[Zeph.3.7|7]] I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, \[and\] corrupted all their doings.

7: 

[[Zeph.3.8|8]] Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination \[is\] to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, \[even\] all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.

8:
