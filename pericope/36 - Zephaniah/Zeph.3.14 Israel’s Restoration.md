[[Zeph.3|Zephaniah 3:14 - Zephaniah 3:20]]
*Israel’s Restoration*

[[Zeph.3.14|14]] Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.

14: 

[[Zeph.3.15|15]] The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, \[even\] the LORD, \[is\] in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.

15: 

[[Zeph.3.16|16]] In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: \[and to\] Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.

16: 

[[Zeph.3.17|17]] The LORD thy God in the midst of thee \[is\] mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.

17: 

[[Zeph.3.18|18]] I will gather \[them that are\] sorrowful for the solemn assembly, \[who\] are of thee, \[to whom\] the reproach of it \[was\] a burden.

18: 

[[Zeph.3.19|19]] Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame.

19: 

[[Zeph.3.20|20]] At that time will I bring you \[again\], even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD.

20:
