*Zephaniah Prophesies Judgment on Judah*

1: 

[[Zeph.1.2|2]] I will utterly consume all \[things\] from off the land, saith the LORD.

2: 

[[Zeph.1.3|3]] I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the LORD.

3: 

[[Zeph.1.4|4]] I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, \[and\] the name of the Chemarims with the priests;

4: 

[[Zeph.1.5|5]] And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship \[and\] that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham;

5: 

[[Zeph.1.6|6]] And them that are turned back from the LORD; and \[those\] that have not sought the LORD, nor inquired for him.

6:
