[[Zeph.3|Zephaniah 3:9 - Zephaniah 3:13]]
*A Faithful Remnant*

[[Zeph.3.9|9]] For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.

9: 

[[Zeph.3.10|10]] From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, \[even\] the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.

10: 

[[Zeph.3.11|11]] In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.

11: 

[[Zeph.3.12|12]] I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.

12: 

[[Zeph.3.13|13]] The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make \[them\] afraid.

13:
