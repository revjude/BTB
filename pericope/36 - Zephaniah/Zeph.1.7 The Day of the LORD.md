[[Zeph.1|Zephaniah 1:7 - Zephaniah 1:18]]
*The Day of the LORD*

[[Zeph.1.7|7]] Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the LORD \[is\] at hand: for the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid his guests.

7: 

[[Zeph.1.8|8]] And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD’S sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king’s children, and all such as are clothed with strange apparel.

8: 

[[Zeph.1.9|9]] In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold, which fill their masters’ houses with violence and deceit.

9: 

[[Zeph.1.10|10]] And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, \[that there shall be\] the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.

10: 

[[Zeph.1.11|11]] Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.

11: 

[[Zeph.1.12|12]] And it shall come to pass at that time, \[that\] I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil.

12: 

[[Zeph.1.13|13]] Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit \[them\]; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof.

13: 

[[Zeph.1.14|14]] The great day of the LORD \[is\] near, \[it is\] near, and hasteth greatly, \[even\] the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.

14: 

[[Zeph.1.15|15]] That day \[is\] a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,

15: 

[[Zeph.1.16|16]] A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers.

16: 

[[Zeph.1.17|17]] And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.

17: 

[[Zeph.1.18|18]] Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD’S wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.

18:
