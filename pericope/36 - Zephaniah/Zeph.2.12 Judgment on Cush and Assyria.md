[[Zeph.2|Zephaniah 2:12 - Zephaniah 2:15]]
*Judgment on Cush and Assyria*

[[Zeph.2.12|12]] Ye Ethiopians also, ye \[shall be\] slain by my sword.

12: 

[[Zeph.2.13|13]] And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, \[and\] dry like a wilderness.

13: 

[[Zeph.2.14|14]] And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; \[their\] voice shall sing in the windows; desolation \[shall be\] in the thresholds: for he shall uncover the cedar work.

14: 

[[Zeph.2.15|15]] This \[is\] the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I \[am\], and \[there is\] none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, \[and\] wag his hand.

15:
