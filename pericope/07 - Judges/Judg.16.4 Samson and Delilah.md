[[Judg.16|Judges 16:4 - Judges 16:14]]
*Samson and Delilah*

[[Judg.16.4|4]] And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name \[was\] Delilah.

4: 

[[Judg.16.5|5]] And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength \[lieth\], and by what \[means\] we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred \[pieces\] of silver.

5: 

[[Judg.16.6|6]] And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength \[lieth\], and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.

6: 

[[Judg.16.7|7]] And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.

7: 

[[Judg.16.8|8]] Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.

8: 

[[Judg.16.9|9]] Now \[there were\] men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines \[be\] upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.

9: 

[[Judg.16.10|10]] And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.

10: 

[[Judg.16.11|11]] And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.

11: 

[[Judg.16.12|12]] Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines \[be\] upon thee, Samson. And \[there were\] liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.

12: 

[[Judg.16.13|13]] And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.

13: 

[[Judg.16.14|14]] And she fastened \[it\] with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines \[be\] upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.
