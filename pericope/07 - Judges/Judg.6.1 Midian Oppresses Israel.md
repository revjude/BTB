[[Judg.6|Judges 6:1 - Judges 6:10]]
*Midian Oppresses Israel*

[[Judg.6.1|1]] And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.

1: 

[[Judg.6.2|2]] And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: \[and\] because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which \[are\] in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.

2: 

[[Judg.6.3|3]] And \[so\] it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;

3: 

[[Judg.6.4|4]] And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.

4: 

[[Judg.6.5|5]] For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; \[for\] both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.

5: 

[[Judg.6.6|6]] And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.

6: 

[[Judg.6.7|7]] And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites,

7: 

[[Judg.6.8|8]] That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;

8: 

[[Judg.6.9|9]] And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land;

9: 

[[Judg.6.10|10]] And I said unto you, I \[am\] the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.

10:
