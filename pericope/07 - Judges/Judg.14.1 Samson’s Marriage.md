[[Judg.14|Judges 14:1 - Judges 14:7]]
*Samson’s Marriage*

[[Judg.14.1|1]] And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.

1: 

[[Judg.14.2|2]] And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.

2: 

[[Judg.14.3|3]] Then his father and his mother said unto him, \[Is there\] never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.

3: 

[[Judg.14.4|4]] But his father and his mother knew not that it \[was\] of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.

4: 

[[Judg.14.5|5]] Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.

5: 

[[Judg.14.6|6]] And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and \[he had\] nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.

6: 

[[Judg.14.7|7]] And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.

7:
