[[Judg.18|Judges 18:1 - Judges 18:13]]
*The Danites Settle in Laish*

[[Judg.18.1|1]] In those days \[there was\] no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day \[all their\] inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.

1: 

[[Judg.18.2|2]] And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.

2: 

[[Judg.18.3|3]] When they \[were\] by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this \[place\]? and what hast thou here?

3: 

[[Judg.18.4|4]] And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.

4: 

[[Judg.18.5|5]] And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.

5: 

[[Judg.18.6|6]] And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD \[is\] your way wherein ye go.

6: 

[[Judg.18.7|7]] Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that \[were\] therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and \[there was\] no magistrate in the land, that might put \[them\] to shame in \[any\] thing; and they \[were\] far from the Zidonians, and had no business with \[any\] man.

7: 

[[Judg.18.8|8]] And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What \[say\] ye?

8: 

[[Judg.18.9|9]] And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it \[is\] very good: and \[are\] ye still? be not slothful to go, \[and\] to enter to possess the land.

9: 

[[Judg.18.10|10]] When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where \[there is\] no want of any thing that \[is\] in the earth.

10: 

[[Judg.18.11|11]] And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.

11: 

[[Judg.18.12|12]] And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, \[it is\] behind Kirjathjearim.

12: 

[[Judg.18.13|13]] And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah.

13:
