[[Judg.16|Judges 16:15 - Judges 16:22]]
*Delilah Learns the Secret*

[[Judg.16.15|15]] And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart \[is\] not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength \[lieth\].

15: 

[[Judg.16.16|16]] And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, \[so\] that his soul was vexed unto death;

16: 

[[Judg.16.17|17]] That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a rasor upon mine head; for I \[have been\] a Nazarite unto God from my mother’s womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any \[other\] man.

17: 

[[Judg.16.18|18]] And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.

18: 

[[Judg.16.19|19]] And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.

19: 

[[Judg.16.20|20]] And she said, The Philistines \[be\] upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.

20: 

[[Judg.16.21|21]] But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.

21: 

[[Judg.16.22|22]] Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.

22:
