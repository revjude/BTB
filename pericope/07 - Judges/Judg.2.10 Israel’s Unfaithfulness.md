[[Judg.2|Judges 2:10 - Judges 2:15]]
*Israel’s Unfaithfulness*

[[Judg.2.10|10]] And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.

10: 

[[Judg.2.11|11]] And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:

11: 

[[Judg.2.12|12]] And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that \[were\] round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.

12: 

[[Judg.2.13|13]] And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.

13: 

[[Judg.2.14|14]] And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.

14: 

[[Judg.2.15|15]] Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.

15:
