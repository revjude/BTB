1: 

[[Judg.3.2|2]] Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;

2: 

[[Judg.3.3|3]] \[Namely\], five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.

5: 

[[Judg.3.6|6]] And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.

6:
