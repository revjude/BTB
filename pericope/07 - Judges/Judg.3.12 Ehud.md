[[Judg.3|Judges 3:12 - Judges 3:30]]
*Ehud*

[[Judg.3.12|12]] And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.

12: 

[[Judg.3.13|13]] And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.

13: 

[[Judg.3.14|14]] So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.

14: 

[[Judg.3.15|15]] But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.

15: 

[[Judg.3.16|16]] But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.

16: 

[[Judg.3.17|17]] And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon \[was\] a very fat man.

17: 

[[Judg.3.18|18]] And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.

18: 

[[Judg.3.19|19]] But he himself turned again from the quarries that \[were\] by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.

19: 

[[Judg.3.20|20]] And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of \[his\] seat.

20: 

[[Judg.3.21|21]] And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:

21: 

[[Judg.3.22|22]] And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.

22: 

[[Judg.3.23|23]] Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.

23: 

[[Judg.3.24|24]] When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour \[were\] locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.

24: 

[[Judg.3.25|25]] And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened \[them\]: and, behold, their lord \[was\] fallen down dead on the earth.

25: 

[[Judg.3.26|26]] And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.

26: 

[[Judg.3.27|27]] And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.

27: 

[[Judg.3.28|28]] And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.

28: 

[[Judg.3.29|29]] And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.

29: 

[[Judg.3.30|30]] So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.

30:
