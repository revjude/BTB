[[Judg.7|Judges 7:15 - Judges 7:25]]
*Gideon Defeats Midian*

[[Judg.7.15|15]] And it was \[so\], when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.

15: 

[[Judg.7.16|16]] And he divided the three hundred men \[into\] three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man’s hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.

16: 

[[Judg.7.17|17]] And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be \[that\], as I do, so shall ye do.

17: 

[[Judg.7.18|18]] When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that \[are\] with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, \[The sword\] of the LORD, and of Gideon.

18: 

[[Judg.7.19|19]] So Gideon, and the hundred men that \[were\] with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that \[were\] in their hands.

19: 

[[Judg.7.20|20]] And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow \[withal\]: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.

20: 

[[Judg.7.21|21]] And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.

21: 

[[Judg.7.22|22]] And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man’s sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, \[and\] to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.

22: 

[[Judg.7.23|23]] And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.

23: 

[[Judg.7.24|24]] And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan.

24: 

[[Judg.7.25|25]] And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.

25:
