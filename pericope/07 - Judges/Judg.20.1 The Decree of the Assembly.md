[[Judg.20|Judges 20:1 - Judges 20:17]]
*The Decree of the Assembly*

[[Judg.20.1|1]] Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.

1: 

[[Judg.20.2|2]] And the chief of all the people, \[even\] of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.

2: 

[[Judg.20.3|3]] (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell \[us\], how was this wickedness?

3: 

[[Judg.20.4|4]] And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that \[belongeth\] to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.

4: 

[[Judg.20.5|5]] And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, \[and\] thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.

5: 

[[Judg.20.6|6]] And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.

6: 

[[Judg.20.7|7]] Behold, ye \[are\] all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.

7: 

[[Judg.20.8|8]] And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any \[of us\] go to his tent, neither will we any \[of us\] turn into his house.

8: 

[[Judg.20.9|9]] But now this \[shall be\] the thing which we will do to Gibeah; \[we will go up\] by lot against it;

9: 

[[Judg.20.10|10]] And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.

10: 

[[Judg.20.11|11]] So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.

11: 

[[Judg.20.12|12]] And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness \[is\] this that is done among you?

12: 

[[Judg.20.13|13]] Now therefore deliver \[us\] the men, the children of Belial, which \[are\] in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel:

13: 

[[Judg.20.14|14]] But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.

14: 

[[Judg.20.15|15]] And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.

15: 

[[Judg.20.16|16]] Among all this people \[there were\] seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair \[breadth\], and not miss.

16: 

[[Judg.20.17|17]] And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these \[were\] men of war.

17:
