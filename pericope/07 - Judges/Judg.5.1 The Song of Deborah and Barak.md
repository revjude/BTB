[[Judg.5|Judges 5:1 - Judges 5:31]]
*The Song of Deborah and Barak*

[[Judg.5.1|1]] Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,

1: 

[[Judg.5.2|2]] Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.

2: 

[[Judg.5.3|3]] Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, \[even\] I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing \[praise\] to the LORD God of Israel.

3: 

[[Judg.5.4|4]] LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.

4: 

[[Judg.5.5|5]] The mountains melted from before the LORD, \[even\] that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.

5: 

[[Judg.5.6|6]] In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.

6: 

[[Judg.5.7|7]] \[The inhabitants of\] the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.

7: 

[[Judg.5.8|8]] They chose new gods; then \[was\] war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?

8: 

[[Judg.5.9|9]] My heart \[is\] toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.

9: 

[[Judg.5.10|10]] Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.

10: 

[[Judg.5.11|11]] \[They that are delivered\] from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, \[even\] the righteous acts \[toward the inhabitants\] of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.

11: 

[[Judg.5.12|12]] Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.

12: 

[[Judg.5.13|13]] Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.

13: 

[[Judg.5.14|14]] Out of Ephraim \[was there\] a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.

14: 

[[Judg.5.15|15]] And the princes of Issachar \[were\] with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben \[there were\] great thoughts of heart.

15: 

[[Judg.5.16|16]] Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben \[there were\] great searchings of heart.

16: 

[[Judg.5.17|17]] Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.

17: 

[[Judg.5.18|18]] Zebulun and Naphtali \[were\] a people \[that\] jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.

18: 

[[Judg.5.19|19]] The kings came \[and\] fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.

19: 

[[Judg.5.20|20]] They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.

20: 

[[Judg.5.21|21]] The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.

21: 

[[Judg.5.22|22]] Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.

22: 

[[Judg.5.23|23]] Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.

23: 

[[Judg.5.24|24]] Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.

24: 

[[Judg.5.25|25]] He asked water, \[and\] she gave \[him\] milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.

25: 

[[Judg.5.26|26]] She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen’s hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.

26: 

[[Judg.5.27|27]] At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.

27: 

[[Judg.5.28|28]] The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot \[so\] long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?

28: 

[[Judg.5.29|29]] Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,

29: 

[[Judg.5.30|30]] Have they not sped? have they \[not\] divided the prey; to every man a damsel \[or\] two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, \[meet\] for the necks of \[them that take\] the spoil?

30: 

[[Judg.5.31|31]] So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but \[let\] them that love him \[be\] as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.

31:
