[[Judg.7|Judges 7:9 - Judges 7:14]]
*The Sword of Gideon*

[[Judg.7.9|9]] And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.

9: 

[[Judg.7.10|10]] But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:

10: 

[[Judg.7.11|11]] And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that \[were\] in the host.

11: 

[[Judg.7.12|12]] And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels \[were\] without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.

12: 

[[Judg.7.13|13]] And when Gideon was come, behold, \[there was\] a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.

13: 

[[Judg.7.14|14]] And his fellow answered and said, This \[is\] nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: \[for\] into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.

14:
