[[Judg.4|Judges 4:1 - Judges 4:16]]
*Deborah and Barak*

[[Judg.4.1|1]] And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead.

1: 

[[Judg.4.2|2]] And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host \[was\] Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.

2: 

[[Judg.4.3|3]] And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.

3: 

[[Judg.4.4|4]] And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.

4: 

[[Judg.4.5|5]] And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.

5: 

[[Judg.4.6|6]] And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, \[saying\], Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?

6: 

[[Judg.4.7|7]] And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand.

7: 

[[Judg.4.8|8]] And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, \[then\] I will not go.

8: 

[[Judg.4.9|9]] And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.

9: 

[[Judg.4.10|10]] And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.

10: 

[[Judg.4.11|11]] Now Heber the Kenite, \[which was\] of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which \[is\] by Kedesh.

11: 

[[Judg.4.12|12]] And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.

12: 

[[Judg.4.13|13]] And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, \[even\] nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that \[were\] with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.

13: 

[[Judg.4.14|14]] And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this \[is\] the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.

14: 

[[Judg.4.15|15]] And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all \[his\] chariots, and all \[his\] host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off \[his\] chariot, and fled away on his feet.

15: 

[[Judg.4.16|16]] But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; \[and\] there was not a man left.

16:
