[[Judg.6|Judges 6:11 - Judges 6:24]]
*The Call of Gideon*

[[Judg.6.11|11]] And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which \[was\] in Ophrah, that \[pertained\] unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide \[it\] from the Midianites.

11: 

[[Judg.6.12|12]] And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD \[is\] with thee, thou mighty man of valour.

12: 

[[Judg.6.13|13]] And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where \[be\] all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.

13: 

[[Judg.6.14|14]] And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?

14: 

[[Judg.6.15|15]] And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family \[is\] poor in Manasseh, and I \[am\] the least in my father’s house.

15: 

[[Judg.6.16|16]] And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.

16: 

[[Judg.6.17|17]] And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.

17: 

[[Judg.6.18|18]] Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set \[it\] before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.

18: 

[[Judg.6.19|19]] And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought \[it\] out unto him under the oak, and presented \[it\].

19: 

[[Judg.6.20|20]] And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay \[them\] upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.

20: 

[[Judg.6.21|21]] Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that \[was\] in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.

21: 

[[Judg.6.22|22]] And when Gideon perceived that he \[was\] an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.

22: 

[[Judg.6.23|23]] And the LORD said unto him, Peace \[be\] unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.

23: 

[[Judg.6.24|24]] Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it \[is\] yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
