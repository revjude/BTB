[[Judg.9|Judges 9:50 - Judges 9:57]]
*Abimelech’s Punishment*

[[Judg.9.50|50]] Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.

50: 

[[Judg.9.51|51]] But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut \[it\] to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.

51: 

[[Judg.9.52|52]] And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.

52: 

[[Judg.9.53|53]] And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech’s head, and all to brake his skull.

53: 

[[Judg.9.54|54]] Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.

54: 

[[Judg.9.55|55]] And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.

55: 

[[Judg.9.56|56]] Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:

56: 

[[Judg.9.57|57]] And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.

57:
