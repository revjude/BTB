[[Judg.8|Judges 8:1 - Judges 8:21]]
*Gideon Defeats Zebah and Zalmunna*

[[Judg.8.1|1]] And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.

1: 

[[Judg.8.2|2]] And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? \[Is\] not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?

2: 

[[Judg.8.3|3]] God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.

3: 

[[Judg.8.4|4]] And Gideon came to Jordan, \[and\] passed over, he, and the three hundred men that \[were\] with him, faint, yet pursuing \[them\].

4: 

[[Judg.8.5|5]] And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they \[be\] faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.

5: 

[[Judg.8.6|6]] And the princes of Succoth said, \[Are\] the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?

6: 

[[Judg.8.7|7]] And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.

7: 

[[Judg.8.8|8]] And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered \[him\].

8: 

[[Judg.8.9|9]] And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.

9: 

[[Judg.8.10|10]] Now Zebah and Zalmunna \[were\] in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand \[men\], all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.

10: 

[[Judg.8.11|11]] And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure.

11: 

[[Judg.8.12|12]] And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.

12: 

[[Judg.8.13|13]] And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun \[was up\],

13: 

[[Judg.8.14|14]] And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, \[even\] threescore and seventeen men.

14: 

[[Judg.8.15|15]] And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, \[Are\] the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men \[that are\] weary?

15: 

[[Judg.8.16|16]] And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.

16: 

[[Judg.8.17|17]] And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.

17: 

[[Judg.8.18|18]] Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men \[were they\] whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou \[art\], so \[were\] they; each one resembled the children of a king.

18: 

[[Judg.8.19|19]] And he said, They \[were\] my brethren, \[even\] the sons of my mother: \[as\] the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.

19: 

[[Judg.8.20|20]] And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, \[and\] slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he \[was\] yet a youth.

20: 

[[Judg.8.21|21]] Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man \[is, so is\] his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that \[were\] on their camels’ necks.

21:
