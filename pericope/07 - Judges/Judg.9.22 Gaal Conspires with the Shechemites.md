[[Judg.9|Judges 9:22 - Judges 9:29]]
*Gaal Conspires with the Shechemites*

[[Judg.9.22|22]] When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,

22: 

[[Judg.9.23|23]] Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:

23: 

[[Judg.9.24|24]] That the cruelty \[done\] to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brethren.

24: 

[[Judg.9.25|25]] And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.

25: 

[[Judg.9.26|26]] And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.

26: 

[[Judg.9.27|27]] And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode \[the grapes\], and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.

27: 

[[Judg.9.28|28]] And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who \[is\] Abimelech, and who \[is\] Shechem, that we should serve him? \[is\] not \[he\] the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?

28: 

[[Judg.9.29|29]] And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.

29:
