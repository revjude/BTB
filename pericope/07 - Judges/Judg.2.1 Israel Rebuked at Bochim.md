[[Judg.2|Judges 2:1 - Judges 2:5]]
*Israel Rebuked at Bochim*

[[Judg.2.1|1]] And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.

1: 

[[Judg.2.2|2]] And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?

2: 

[[Judg.2.3|3]] Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be \[as thorns\] in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.

3: 

[[Judg.2.4|4]] And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.

4: 

[[Judg.2.5|5]] And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD.

5:
