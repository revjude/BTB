[[Judg.4|Judges 4:17 - Judges 4:24]]
*Jael Kills Sisera*

[[Judg.4.17|17]] Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for \[there was\] peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.

17: 

[[Judg.4.18|18]] And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.

18: 

[[Judg.4.19|19]] And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.

19: 

[[Judg.4.20|20]] Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.

20: 

[[Judg.4.21|21]] Then Jael Heber’s wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.

21: 

[[Judg.4.22|22]] And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her \[tent\], behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail \[was\] in his temples.

22: 

[[Judg.4.23|23]] So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.

23: 

[[Judg.4.24|24]] And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
