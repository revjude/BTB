[[Judg.6|Judges 6:33 - Judges 6:40]]
*The Sign of the Fleece*

[[Judg.6.33|33]] Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.

33: 

[[Judg.6.34|34]] But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.

34: 

[[Judg.6.35|35]] And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.

35: 

[[Judg.6.36|36]] And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,

36: 

[[Judg.6.37|37]] Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; \[and\] if the dew be on the fleece only, and \[it be\] dry upon all the earth \[beside\], then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.

37: 

[[Judg.6.38|38]] And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.

38: 

[[Judg.6.39|39]] And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.

39: 

[[Judg.6.40|40]] And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.

40:
