*Abimelech’s Conspiracy*

[[Judg.9.1|1]] And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother’s brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying,

1: 

[[Judg.9.2|2]] Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether \[is\] better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, \[which are\] threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I \[am\] your bone and your flesh.

2: 

[[Judg.9.3|3]] And his mother’s brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He \[is\] our brother.

3: 

[[Judg.9.4|4]] And they gave him threescore and ten \[pieces\] of silver out of the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.

4: 

[[Judg.9.5|5]] And he went unto his father’s house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, \[being\] threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.

5: 

[[Judg.9.6|6]] And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that \[was\] in Shechem.
