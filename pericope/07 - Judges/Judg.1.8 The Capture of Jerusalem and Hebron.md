[[Judg.1|Judges 1:8 - Judges 1:26]]
*The Capture of Jerusalem and Hebron*

[[Judg.1.8|8]] Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.

8: 

[[Judg.1.9|9]] And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.

9: 

[[Judg.1.10|10]] And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before \[was\] Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.

10: 

[[Judg.1.11|11]] And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before \[was\] Kirjathsepher:

11: 

[[Judg.1.12|12]] And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

12: 

[[Judg.1.13|13]] And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

13: 

[[Judg.1.14|14]] And it came to pass, when she came \[to him\], that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off \[her\] ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?

14: 

[[Judg.1.15|15]] And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.

15: 

[[Judg.1.16|16]] And the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which \[lieth\] in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.

16: 

[[Judg.1.17|17]] And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.

17: 

[[Judg.1.18|18]] Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.

18: 

[[Judg.1.19|19]] And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out \[the inhabitants of\] the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.

19: 

[[Judg.1.20|20]] And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.

20: 

[[Judg.1.21|21]] And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.

21: 

[[Judg.1.22|22]] And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD \[was\] with them.

22: 

[[Judg.1.23|23]] And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before \[was\] Luz.)

23: 

[[Judg.1.24|24]] And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.

24: 

[[Judg.1.25|25]] And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.

25: 

[[Judg.1.26|26]] And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which \[is\] the name thereof unto this day.

26:
