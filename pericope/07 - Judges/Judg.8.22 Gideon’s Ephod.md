[[Judg.8|Judges 8:22 - Judges 8:27]]
*Gideon’s Ephod*

[[Judg.8.22|22]] Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.

22: 

[[Judg.8.23|23]] And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.

23: 

[[Judg.8.24|24]] And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they \[were\] Ishmaelites.)

24: 

[[Judg.8.25|25]] And they answered, We will willingly give \[them\]. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.

25: 

[[Judg.8.26|26]] And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred \[shekels\] of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that \[was\] on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that \[were\] about their camels’ necks.

26: 

[[Judg.8.27|27]] And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, \[even\] in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.

27:
