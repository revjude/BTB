[[Judg.7|Judges 7:1 - Judges 7:8]]
*Gideon’s Army of Three Hundred*

[[Judg.7.1|1]] Then Jerubbaal, who \[is\] Gideon, and all the people that \[were\] with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.

1: 

[[Judg.7.2|2]] And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that \[are\] with thee \[are\] too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.

2: 

[[Judg.7.3|3]] Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever \[is\] fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.

3: 

[[Judg.7.4|4]] And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people \[are\] yet \[too\] many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, \[that\] of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.

4: 

[[Judg.7.5|5]] So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.

5: 

[[Judg.7.6|6]] And the number of them that lapped, \[putting\] their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.

6: 

[[Judg.7.7|7]] And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the \[other\] people go every man unto his place.

7: 

[[Judg.7.8|8]] So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all \[the rest of\] Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.

8:
