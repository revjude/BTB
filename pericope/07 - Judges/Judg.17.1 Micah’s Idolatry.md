[[Judg.17|Judges 17:1 - Judges 17:13]]
*Micah’s Idolatry*

[[Judg.17.1|1]] And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name \[was\] Micah.

1: 

[[Judg.17.2|2]] And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred \[shekels\] of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver \[is\] with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed \[be thou\] of the LORD, my son.

2: 

[[Judg.17.3|3]] And when he had restored the eleven hundred \[shekels\] of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.

3: 

[[Judg.17.4|4]] Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred \[shekels\] of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.

4: 

[[Judg.17.5|5]] And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.

5: 

[[Judg.17.6|6]] In those days \[there was\] no king in Israel, \[but\] every man did \[that which was\] right in his own eyes.

6: 

[[Judg.17.7|7]] And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who \[was\] a Levite, and he sojourned there.

7: 

[[Judg.17.8|8]] And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find \[a place\]: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.

8: 

[[Judg.17.9|9]] And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I \[am\] a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find \[a place\].

9: 

[[Judg.17.10|10]] And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten \[shekels\] of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.

10: 

[[Judg.17.11|11]] And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.

11: 

[[Judg.17.12|12]] And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.

12: 

[[Judg.17.13|13]] Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to \[my\] priest.

13:
