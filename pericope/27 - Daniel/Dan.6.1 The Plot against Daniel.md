[[Dan.6|Daniel 6:1 - Daniel 6:9]]
*The Plot against Daniel*

[[Dan.6.1|1]] It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;

1: 

[[Dan.6.2|2]] And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel \[was\] first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage.

2: 

[[Dan.6.3|3]] Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit \[was\] in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.

3: 

[[Dan.6.4|4]] Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he \[was\] faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.

4: 

[[Dan.6.5|5]] Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find \[it\] against him concerning the law of his God.

5: 

[[Dan.6.6|6]] Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.

6: 

[[Dan.6.7|7]] All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellers, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.

7: 

[[Dan.6.8|8]] Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.

8: 

[[Dan.6.9|9]] Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.

9:
