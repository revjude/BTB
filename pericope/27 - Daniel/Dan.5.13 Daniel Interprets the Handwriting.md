[[Dan.5|Daniel 5:13 - Daniel 5:31]]
*Daniel Interprets the Handwriting*

[[Dan.5.13|13]] Then was Daniel brought in before the king. \[And\] the king spake and said unto Daniel, \[Art\] thou that Daniel, which \[art\] of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?

13: 

[[Dan.5.14|14]] I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods \[is\] in thee, and \[that\] light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.

14: 

[[Dan.5.15|15]] And now the wise \[men\], the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing:

15: 

[[Dan.5.16|16]] And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and \[have\] a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.

16: 

[[Dan.5.17|17]] Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.

17: 

[[Dan.5.18|18]] O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:

18: 

[[Dan.5.19|19]] And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.

19: 

[[Dan.5.20|20]] But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:

20: 

[[Dan.5.21|21]] And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling \[was\] with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and \[that\] he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.

21: 

[[Dan.5.22|22]] And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this;

22: 

[[Dan.5.23|23]] But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath \[is\], and whose \[are\] all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:

23: 

[[Dan.5.24|24]] Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.

24: 

[[Dan.5.25|25]] And this \[is\] the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.

25: 

[[Dan.5.26|26]] This \[is\] the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.

26: 

[[Dan.5.27|27]] TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.

27: 

[[Dan.5.28|28]] PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.

28: 

[[Dan.5.29|29]] Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and \[put\] a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.

29: 

[[Dan.5.30|30]] In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.

30: 

[[Dan.5.31|31]] And Darius the Median took the kingdom, \[being\] about threescore and two years old.

31:
