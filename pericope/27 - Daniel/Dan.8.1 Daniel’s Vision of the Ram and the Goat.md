[[Dan.8|Daniel 8:1 - Daniel 8:14]]
*Daniel’s Vision of the Ram and the Goat*

[[Dan.8.1|1]] In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, \[even unto\] me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.

1: 

[[Dan.8.2|2]] And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I \[was\] at Shushan \[in\] the palace, which \[is\] in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.

2: 

[[Dan.8.3|3]] Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had \[two\] horns: and the \[two\] horns \[were\] high; but one \[was\] higher than the other, and the higher came up last.

3: 

[[Dan.8.4|4]] I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither \[was there any\] that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.

4: 

[[Dan.8.5|5]] And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat \[had\] a notable horn between his eyes.

5: 

[[Dan.8.6|6]] And he came to the ram that had \[two\] horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.

6: 

[[Dan.8.7|7]] And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.

7: 

[[Dan.8.8|8]] Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.

8: 

[[Dan.8.9|9]] And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant \[land\].

9: 

[[Dan.8.10|10]] And it waxed great, \[even\] to the host of heaven; and it cast down \[some\] of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.

10: 

[[Dan.8.11|11]] Yea, he magnified \[himself\] even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily \[sacrifice\] was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.

11: 

[[Dan.8.12|12]] And an host was given \[him\] against the daily \[sacrifice\] by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.

12: 

[[Dan.8.13|13]] Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain \[saint\] which spake, How long \[shall be\] the vision \[concerning\] the daily \[sacrifice\], and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?

13: 

[[Dan.8.14|14]] And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
