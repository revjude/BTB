[[Dan.11|Daniel 11:36 - Daniel 11:45]]
*The King Who Exalts Himself*

[[Dan.11.36|36]] And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.

36: 

[[Dan.11.37|37]] Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.

37: 

[[Dan.11.38|38]] But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.

38: 

[[Dan.11.39|39]] Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge \[and\] increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.

39: 

[[Dan.11.40|40]] And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.

40: 

[[Dan.11.41|41]] He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many \[countries\] shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, \[even\] Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.

41: 

[[Dan.11.42|42]] He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.

42: 

[[Dan.11.43|43]] But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians \[shall be\] at his steps.

43: 

[[Dan.11.44|44]] But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.

44: 

[[Dan.11.45|45]] And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.

45:
