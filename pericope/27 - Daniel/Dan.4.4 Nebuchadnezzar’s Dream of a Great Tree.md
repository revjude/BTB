[[Dan.4|Daniel 4:4 - Daniel 4:18]]
*Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream of a Great Tree*

[[Dan.4.4|4]] I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace:

4: 

[[Dan.4.5|5]] I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.

5: 

[[Dan.4.6|6]] Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise \[men\] of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.

6: 

[[Dan.4.7|7]] Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.

7: 

[[Dan.4.8|8]] But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name \[was\] Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom \[is\] the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, \[saying\],

8: 

[[Dan.4.9|9]] O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods \[is\] in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.

9: 

[[Dan.4.10|10]] Thus \[were\] the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof \[was\] great.

10: 

[[Dan.4.11|11]] The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:

11: 

[[Dan.4.12|12]] The leaves thereof \[were\] fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it \[was\] meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.

12: 

[[Dan.4.13|13]] I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;

13: 

[[Dan.4.14|14]] He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:

14: 

[[Dan.4.15|15]] Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and \[let\] his portion \[be\] with the beasts in the grass of the earth:

15: 

[[Dan.4.16|16]] Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.

16: 

[[Dan.4.17|17]] This matter \[is\] by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.

17: 

[[Dan.4.18|18]] This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise \[men\] of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou \[art\] able; for the spirit of the holy gods \[is\] in thee.

18:
