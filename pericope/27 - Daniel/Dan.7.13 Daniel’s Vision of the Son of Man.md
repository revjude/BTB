[[Dan.7|Daniel 7:13 - Daniel 7:14]]
*Daniel’s Vision of the Son of Man*

[[Dan.7.13|13]] I saw in the night visions, and, behold, \[one\] like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.

13: 

[[Dan.7.14|14]] And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion \[is\] an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom \[that\] which shall not be destroyed.

14:
