[[Dan.2|Daniel 2:24 - Daniel 2:45]]
*Daniel Interprets the Dream*

[[Dan.2.24|24]] Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise \[men\] of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise \[men\] of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.

24: 

[[Dan.2.25|25]] Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.

25: 

[[Dan.2.26|26]] The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name \[was\] Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?

26: 

[[Dan.2.27|27]] Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise \[men\], the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;

27: 

[[Dan.2.28|28]] But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;

28: 

[[Dan.2.29|29]] As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came \[into thy mind\] upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.

29: 

[[Dan.2.30|30]] But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for \[any\] wisdom that I have more than any living, but for \[their\] sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.

30: 

[[Dan.2.31|31]] Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness \[was\] excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof \[was\] terrible.

31: 

[[Dan.2.32|32]] This image’s head \[was\] of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,

32: 

[[Dan.2.33|33]] His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.

33: 

[[Dan.2.34|34]] Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet \[that were\] of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.

34: 

[[Dan.2.35|35]] Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.

35: 

[[Dan.2.36|36]] This \[is\] the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.

36: 

[[Dan.2.37|37]] Thou, O king, \[art\] a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.

37: 

[[Dan.2.38|38]] And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou \[art\] this head of gold.

38: 

[[Dan.2.39|39]] And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.

39: 

[[Dan.2.40|40]] And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all \[things\]: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.

40: 

[[Dan.2.41|41]] And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.

41: 

[[Dan.2.42|42]] And \[as\] the toes of the feet \[were\] part of iron, and part of clay, \[so\] the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.

42: 

[[Dan.2.43|43]] And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.

43: 

[[Dan.2.44|44]] And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, \[but\] it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.

44: 

[[Dan.2.45|45]] Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream \[is\] certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.
