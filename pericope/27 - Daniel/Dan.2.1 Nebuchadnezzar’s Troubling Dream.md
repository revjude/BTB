[[Dan.2|Daniel 2:1 - Daniel 2:13]]
*Nebuchadnezzar’s Troubling Dream*

[[Dan.2.1|1]] And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.

1: 

[[Dan.2.2|2]] Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.

2: 

[[Dan.2.3|3]] And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.

3: 

[[Dan.2.4|4]] Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.

4: 

[[Dan.2.5|5]] The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.

5: 

[[Dan.2.6|6]] But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.

6: 

[[Dan.2.7|7]] They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.

7: 

[[Dan.2.8|8]] The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.

8: 

[[Dan.2.9|9]] But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, \[there is but\] one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.

9: 

[[Dan.2.10|10]] The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter: therefore \[there is\] no king, lord, nor ruler, \[that\] asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.

10: 

[[Dan.2.11|11]] And \[it is\] a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.

11: 

[[Dan.2.12|12]] For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise \[men\] of Babylon.

12: 

[[Dan.2.13|13]] And the decree went forth that the wise \[men\] should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.
