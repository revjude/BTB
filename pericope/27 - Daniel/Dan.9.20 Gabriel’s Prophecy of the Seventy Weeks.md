[[Dan.9|Daniel 9:20 - Daniel 9:27]]
*Gabriel’s Prophecy of the Seventy Weeks*

[[Dan.9.20|20]] And whiles I \[was\] speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;

20: 

[[Dan.9.21|21]] Yea, whiles I \[was\] speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.

21: 

[[Dan.9.22|22]] And he informed \[me\], and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.

22: 

[[Dan.9.23|23]] At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew \[thee\]; for thou \[art\] greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.

23: 

[[Dan.9.24|24]] Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.

24: 

[[Dan.9.25|25]] Know therefore and understand, \[that\] from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince \[shall be\] seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.

25: 

[[Dan.9.26|26]] And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof \[shall be\] with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.

26: 

[[Dan.9.27|27]] And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make \[it\] desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.

27:
