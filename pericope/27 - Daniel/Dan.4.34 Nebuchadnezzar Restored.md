[[Dan.4|Daniel 4:34 - Daniel 4:37]]
*Nebuchadnezzar Restored*

[[Dan.4.34|34]] And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion \[is\] an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom \[is\] from generation to generation:

34: 

[[Dan.4.35|35]] And all the inhabitants of the earth \[are\] reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and \[among\] the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?

35: 

[[Dan.4.36|36]] At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellers and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.

36: 

[[Dan.4.37|37]] Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works \[are\] truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.

37:
