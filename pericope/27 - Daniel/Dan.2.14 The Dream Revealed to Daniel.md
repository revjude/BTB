[[Dan.2|Daniel 2:14 - Daniel 2:23]]
*The Dream Revealed to Daniel*

[[Dan.2.14|14]] Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise \[men\] of Babylon:

14: 

[[Dan.2.15|15]] He answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Why \[is\] the decree \[so\] hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.

15: 

[[Dan.2.16|16]] Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.

16: 

[[Dan.2.17|17]] Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:

17: 

[[Dan.2.18|18]] That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise \[men\] of Babylon.

18: 

[[Dan.2.19|19]] Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.

19: 

[[Dan.2.20|20]] Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:

20: 

[[Dan.2.21|21]] And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:

21: 

[[Dan.2.22|22]] He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what \[is\] in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.

22: 

[[Dan.2.23|23]] I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast \[now\] made known unto us the king’s matter.

23:
