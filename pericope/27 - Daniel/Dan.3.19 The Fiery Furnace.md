[[Dan.3|Daniel 3:19 - Daniel 3:30]]
*The Fiery Furnace*

[[Dan.3.19|19]] Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: \[therefore\] he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.

19: 

[[Dan.3.20|20]] And he commanded the most mighty men that \[were\] in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, \[and\] to cast \[them\] into the burning fiery furnace.

20: 

[[Dan.3.21|21]] Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their \[other\] garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.

21: 

[[Dan.3.22|22]] Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

22: 

[[Dan.3.23|23]] And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.

23: 

[[Dan.3.24|24]] Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, \[and\] spake, and said unto his counsellers, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.

24: 

[[Dan.3.25|25]] He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.

25: 

[[Dan.3.26|26]] Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, \[and\] spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come \[hither\]. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.

26: 

[[Dan.3.27|27]] And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counsellers, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.

27: 

[[Dan.3.28|28]] \[Then\] Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed \[be\] the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.

28: 

[[Dan.3.29|29]] Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.

29: 

[[Dan.3.30|30]] Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.
