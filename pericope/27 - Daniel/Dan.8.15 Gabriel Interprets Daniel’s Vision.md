[[Dan.8|Daniel 8:15 - Daniel 8:27]]
*Gabriel Interprets Daniel’s Vision*

[[Dan.8.15|15]] And it came to pass, when I, \[even\] I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.

15: 

[[Dan.8.16|16]] And I heard a man’s voice between \[the banks of\] Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this \[man\] to understand the vision.

16: 

[[Dan.8.17|17]] So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end \[shall be\] the vision.

17: 

[[Dan.8.18|18]] Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.

18: 

[[Dan.8.19|19]] And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end \[shall be\].

19: 

[[Dan.8.20|20]] The ram which thou sawest having \[two\] horns \[are\] the kings of Media and Persia.

20: 

[[Dan.8.21|21]] And the rough goat \[is\] the king of Grecia: and the great horn that \[is\] between his eyes \[is\] the first king.

21: 

[[Dan.8.22|22]] Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.

22: 

[[Dan.8.23|23]] And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.

23: 

[[Dan.8.24|24]] And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.

24: 

[[Dan.8.25|25]] And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify \[himself\] in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.

25: 

[[Dan.8.26|26]] And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told \[is\] true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it \[shall be\] for many days.

26: 

[[Dan.8.27|27]] And I Daniel fainted, and was sick \[certain\] days; afterward I rose up, and did the king’s business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood \[it\].

27:
