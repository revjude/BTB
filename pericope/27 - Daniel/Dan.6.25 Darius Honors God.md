[[Dan.6|Daniel 6:25 - Daniel 6:28]]
*Darius Honors God*

[[Dan.6.25|25]] Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.

25: 

[[Dan.6.26|26]] I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he \[is\] the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom \[that\] which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion \[shall be even\] unto the end.

26: 

[[Dan.6.27|27]] He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.

27: 

[[Dan.6.28|28]] So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

28:
