[[Dan.5|Daniel 5:5 - Daniel 5:12]]
*The Handwriting on the Wall*

[[Dan.5.5|5]] In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king’s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.

5: 

[[Dan.5.6|6]] Then the king’s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.

6: 

[[Dan.5.7|7]] The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. \[And\] the king spake, and said to the wise \[men\] of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and \[have\] a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.

7: 

[[Dan.5.8|8]] Then came in all the king’s wise \[men\]: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.

8: 

[[Dan.5.9|9]] Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.

9: 

[[Dan.5.10|10]] \[Now\] the queen, by reason of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banquet house: \[and\] the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:

10: 

[[Dan.5.11|11]] There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom \[is\] the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, \[I say\], thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, \[and\] soothsayers;

11: 

[[Dan.5.12|12]] Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.

12:
