[[Dan.3|Daniel 3:1 - Daniel 3:7]]
*Nebuchadnezzar’s Golden Statue*

[[Dan.3.1|1]] Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height \[was\] threescore cubits, \[and\] the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.

1: 

[[Dan.3.2|2]] Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellers, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.

2: 

[[Dan.3.3|3]] Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellers, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

3: 

[[Dan.3.4|4]] Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,

4: 

[[Dan.3.5|5]] \[That\] at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:

5: 

[[Dan.3.6|6]] And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.

6: 

[[Dan.3.7|7]] Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down \[and\] worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.

7:
