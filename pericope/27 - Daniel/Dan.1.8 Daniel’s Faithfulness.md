[[Dan.1|Daniel 1:8 - Daniel 1:16]]
*Daniel’s Faithfulness*

[[Dan.1.8|8]] But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.

8: 

[[Dan.1.9|9]] Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.

9: 

[[Dan.1.10|10]] And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which \[are\] of your sort? then shall ye make \[me\] endanger my head to the king.

10: 

[[Dan.1.11|11]] Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,

11: 

[[Dan.1.12|12]] Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.

12: 

[[Dan.1.13|13]] Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.

13: 

[[Dan.1.14|14]] So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.

14: 

[[Dan.1.15|15]] And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king’s meat.

15: 

[[Dan.1.16|16]] Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.

16:
