[[Dan.7|Daniel 7:9 - Daniel 7:12]]
*Daniel’s Vision of the Ancient of Days*

[[Dan.7.9|9]] I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment \[was\] white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne \[was like\] the fiery flame, \[and\] his wheels \[as\] burning fire.

9: 

[[Dan.7.10|10]] A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.

10: 

[[Dan.7.11|11]] I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld \[even\] till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.

11: 

[[Dan.7.12|12]] As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.

12:
