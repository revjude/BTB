[[Dan.4|Daniel 4:28 - Daniel 4:33]]
*The Second Dream Fulfilled*

[[Dan.4.28|28]] All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.

28: 

[[Dan.4.29|29]] At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.

29: 

[[Dan.4.30|30]] The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?

30: 

[[Dan.4.31|31]] While the word \[was\] in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, \[saying\], O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.

31: 

[[Dan.4.32|32]] And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling \[shall be\] with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.

32: 

[[Dan.4.33|33]] The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles’ \[feathers\], and his nails like birds’ \[claws\].

33:
