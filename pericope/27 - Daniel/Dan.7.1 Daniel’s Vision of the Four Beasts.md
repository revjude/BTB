[[Dan.7|Daniel 7:1 - Daniel 7:8]]
*Daniel’s Vision of the Four Beasts*

[[Dan.7.1|1]] In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, \[and\] told the sum of the matters.

1: 

[[Dan.7.2|2]] Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.

2: 

[[Dan.7.3|3]] And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.

3: 

[[Dan.7.4|4]] The first \[was\] like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to it.

4: 

[[Dan.7.5|5]] And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and \[it had\] three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.

5: 

[[Dan.7.6|6]] After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.

6: 

[[Dan.7.7|7]] After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it \[was\] diverse from all the beasts that \[were\] before it; and it had ten horns.

7: 

[[Dan.7.8|8]] I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn \[were\] eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.

8:
