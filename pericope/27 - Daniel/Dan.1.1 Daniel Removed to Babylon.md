[[Dan.1|Daniel 1:1 - Daniel 1:7]]
*Daniel Removed to Babylon*

[[Dan.1.1|1]] In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.

1: 

[[Dan.1.2|2]] And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.

2: 

[[Dan.1.3|3]] And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring \[certain\] of the children of Israel, and of the king’s seed, and of the princes;

3: 

[[Dan.1.4|4]] Children in whom \[was\] no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as \[had\] ability in them to stand in the king’s palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.

4: 

[[Dan.1.5|5]] And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.

5: 

[[Dan.1.6|6]] Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:

6: 

[[Dan.1.7|7]] Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel \[the name\] of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.

7:
