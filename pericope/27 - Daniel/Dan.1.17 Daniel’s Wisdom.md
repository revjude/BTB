[[Dan.1|Daniel 1:17 - Daniel 1:21]]
*Daniel’s Wisdom*

[[Dan.1.17|17]] As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.

17: 

[[Dan.1.18|18]] Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.

18: 

[[Dan.1.19|19]] And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.

19: 

[[Dan.1.20|20]] And in all matters of wisdom \[and\] understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians \[and\] astrologers that \[were\] in all his realm.

20: 

[[Dan.1.21|21]] And Daniel continued \[even\] unto the first year of king Cyrus.

21:
