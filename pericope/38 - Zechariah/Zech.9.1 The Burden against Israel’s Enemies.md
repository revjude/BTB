[[Zech.9|Zechariah 9:1 - Zechariah 9:8]]
*The Burden against Israel’s Enemies*

[[Zech.9.1|1]] The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus \[shall be\] the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, \[shall be\] toward the LORD.

1: 

[[Zech.9.2|2]] And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise.

2: 

[[Zech.9.3|3]] And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.

3: 

[[Zech.9.4|4]] Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.

4: 

[[Zech.9.5|5]] Ashkelon shall see \[it\], and fear; Gaza also \[shall see it\], and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.

5: 

[[Zech.9.6|6]] And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.

6: 

[[Zech.9.7|7]] And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, \[shall be\] for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.

7: 

[[Zech.9.8|8]] And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.

8:
