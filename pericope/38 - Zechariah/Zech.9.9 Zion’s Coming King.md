[[Zech.9|Zechariah 9:9 - Zechariah 9:13]]
*Zion’s Coming King*

[[Zech.9.9|9]] Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he \[is\] just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.

9: 

[[Zech.9.10|10]] And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion \[shall be\] from sea \[even\] to sea, and from the river \[even\] to the ends of the earth.

10: 

[[Zech.9.11|11]] As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein \[is\] no water.

11: 

[[Zech.9.12|12]] Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare \[that\] I will render double unto thee;

12: 

[[Zech.9.13|13]] When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.

13:
