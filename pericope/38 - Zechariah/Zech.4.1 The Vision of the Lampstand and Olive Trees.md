[[Zech.4|Zechariah 4:1 - Zechariah 4:14]]
*The Vision of the Lampstand and Olive Trees*

[[Zech.4.1|1]] And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,

1: 

[[Zech.4.2|2]] And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all \[of\] gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which \[are\] upon the top thereof:

2: 

[[Zech.4.3|3]] And two olive trees by it, one upon the right \[side\] of the bowl, and the other upon the left \[side\] thereof.

3: 

[[Zech.4.4|4]] So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What \[are\] these, my lord?

4: 

[[Zech.4.5|5]] Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.

5: 

[[Zech.4.6|6]] Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This \[is\] the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.

6: 

[[Zech.4.7|7]] Who \[art\] thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel \[thou shalt become\] a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone \[thereof with\] shoutings, \[crying\], Grace, grace unto it.

7: 

[[Zech.4.8|8]] Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

8: 

[[Zech.4.9|9]] The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.

9: 

[[Zech.4.10|10]] For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel \[with\] those seven; they \[are\] the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.

10: 

[[Zech.4.11|11]] Then answered I, and said unto him, What \[are\] these two olive trees upon the right \[side\] of the candlestick and upon the left \[side\] thereof?

11: 

[[Zech.4.12|12]] And I answered again, and said unto him, What \[be these\] two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden \[oil\] out of themselves?

12: 

[[Zech.4.13|13]] And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these \[be\]? And I said, No, my lord.

13: 

[[Zech.4.14|14]] Then said he, These \[are\] the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.

14:
