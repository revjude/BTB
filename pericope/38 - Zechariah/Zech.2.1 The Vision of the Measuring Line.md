[[Zech.2|Zechariah 2:1 - Zechariah 2:5]]
*The Vision of the Measuring Line*

[[Zech.2.1|1]] I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.

1: 

[[Zech.2.2|2]] Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what \[is\] the breadth thereof, and what \[is\] the length thereof.

2: 

[[Zech.2.3|3]] And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,

3: 

[[Zech.2.4|4]] And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited \[as\] towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:

4: 

[[Zech.2.5|5]] For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.

5:
