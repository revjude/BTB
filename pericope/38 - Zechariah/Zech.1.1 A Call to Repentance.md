[[Zech.1|Zechariah 1:1 - Zechariah 1:6]]
*A Call to Repentance*

1: 

[[Zech.1.2|2]] The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers.

2: 

[[Zech.1.3|3]] Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts.

3: 

[[Zech.1.4|4]] Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and \[from\] your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD.

4: 

[[Zech.1.5|5]] Your fathers, where \[are\] they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?

5: 

[[Zech.1.6|6]] But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.

6:
