[[Zech.11|Zechariah 11:10 - Zechariah 11:17]]
*Thirty Pieces of Silver*

[[Zech.11.10|10]] And I took my staff, \[even\] Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.

10: 

[[Zech.11.11|11]] And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it \[was\] the word of the LORD.

11: 

[[Zech.11.12|12]] And I said unto them, If ye think good, give \[me\] my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty \[pieces\] of silver.

12: 

[[Zech.11.13|13]] And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty \[pieces\] of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.

13: 

[[Zech.11.14|14]] Then I cut asunder mine other staff, \[even\] Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.

14: 

[[Zech.11.15|15]] And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.

15: 

[[Zech.11.16|16]] For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, \[which\] shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.

16: 

[[Zech.11.17|17]] Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword \[shall be\] upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.

17:
