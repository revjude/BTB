[[Zech.12|Zechariah 12:10 - Zechariah 12:14]]
*Mourning the One They Pierced*

[[Zech.12.10|10]] And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for \[his\] only \[son\], and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for \[his\] firstborn.

10: 

[[Zech.12.11|11]] In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.

11: 

[[Zech.12.12|12]] And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;

12: 

[[Zech.12.13|13]] The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;

13: 

[[Zech.12.14|14]] All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.

14:
