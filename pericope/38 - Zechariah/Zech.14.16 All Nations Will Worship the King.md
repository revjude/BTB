[[Zech.14|Zechariah 14:16 - Zechariah 14:21]]
*All Nations Will Worship the King*

[[Zech.14.16|16]] And it shall come to pass, \[that\] every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.

16: 

[[Zech.14.17|17]] And it shall be, \[that\] whoso will not come up of \[all\] the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.

17: 

[[Zech.14.18|18]] And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that \[have\] no \[rain\]; there shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.

18: 

[[Zech.14.19|19]] This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.

19: 

[[Zech.14.20|20]] In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD’S house shall be like the bowls before the altar.

20: 

[[Zech.14.21|21]] Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts.

21:
