[[Zech.2|Zechariah 2:6 - Zechariah 2:13]]
*The Redemption of Zion*

[[Zech.2.6|6]] Ho, ho, \[come forth\], and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.

6: 

[[Zech.2.7|7]] Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest \[with\] the daughter of Babylon.

7: 

[[Zech.2.8|8]] For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.

8: 

[[Zech.2.9|9]] For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.

9: 

[[Zech.2.10|10]] Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.

10: 

[[Zech.2.11|11]] And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.

11: 

[[Zech.2.12|12]] And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.

12: 

[[Zech.2.13|13]] Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.

13:
