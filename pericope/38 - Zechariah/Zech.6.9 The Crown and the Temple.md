[[Zech.6|Zechariah 6:9 - Zechariah 6:15]]
*The Crown and the Temple*

[[Zech.6.9|9]] And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

9: 

[[Zech.6.10|10]] Take of \[them of\] the captivity, \[even\] of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;

10: 

[[Zech.6.11|11]] Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set \[them\] upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;

11: 

[[Zech.6.12|12]] And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name \[is\] The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:

12: 

[[Zech.6.13|13]] Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.

13: 

[[Zech.6.14|14]] And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD.

14: 

[[Zech.6.15|15]] And they \[that are\] far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. And \[this\] shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.

15:
