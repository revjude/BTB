[[Zech.13|Zechariah 13:7 - Zechariah 13:9]]
*The Shepherd Struck, the Sheep Scattered*

[[Zech.13.7|7]] Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man \[that is\] my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.

7: 

[[Zech.13.8|8]] And it shall come to pass, \[that\] in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off \[and\] die; but the third shall be left therein.

8: 

[[Zech.13.9|9]] And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It \[is\] my people: and they shall say, The LORD \[is\] my God.

9:
