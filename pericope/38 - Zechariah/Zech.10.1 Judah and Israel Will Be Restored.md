[[Zech.10|Zechariah 10:1 - Zechariah 10:12]]
*Judah and Israel Will Be Restored*

[[Zech.10.1|1]] Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; \[so\] the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.

1: 

[[Zech.10.2|2]] For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because \[there was\] no shepherd.

2: 

[[Zech.10.3|3]] Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.

3: 

[[Zech.10.4|4]] Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.

4: 

[[Zech.10.5|5]] And they shall be as mighty \[men\], which tread down \[their enemies\] in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD \[is\] with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.

5: 

[[Zech.10.6|6]] And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I \[am\] the LORD their God, and will hear them.

6: 

[[Zech.10.7|7]] And \[they of\] Ephraim shall be like a mighty \[man\], and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see \[it\], and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.

7: 

[[Zech.10.8|8]] I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased.

8: 

[[Zech.10.9|9]] And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again.

9: 

[[Zech.10.10|10]] I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and \[place\] shall not be found for them.

10: 

[[Zech.10.11|11]] And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.

11: 

[[Zech.10.12|12]] And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD.

12:
