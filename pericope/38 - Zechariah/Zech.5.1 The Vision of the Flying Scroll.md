[[Zech.5|Zechariah 5:1 - Zechariah 5:4]]
*The Vision of the Flying Scroll*

[[Zech.5.1|1]] Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.

1: 

[[Zech.5.2|2]] And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof \[is\] twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.

2: 

[[Zech.5.3|3]] Then said he unto me, This \[is\] the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off \[as\] on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off \[as\] on that side according to it.

3: 

[[Zech.5.4|4]] I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.

4:
