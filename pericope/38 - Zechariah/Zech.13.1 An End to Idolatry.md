[[Zech.13|Zechariah 13:1 - Zechariah 13:6]]
*An End to Idolatry*

[[Zech.13.1|1]] In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.

1: 

[[Zech.13.2|2]] And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, \[that\] I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.

2: 

[[Zech.13.3|3]] And it shall come to pass, \[that\] when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.

3: 

[[Zech.13.4|4]] And it shall come to pass in that day, \[that\] the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:

4: 

[[Zech.13.5|5]] But he shall say, I \[am\] no prophet, I \[am\] an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth.

5: 

[[Zech.13.6|6]] And \[one\] shall say unto him, What \[are\] these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, \[Those\] with which I was wounded \[in\] the house of my friends.

6:
