[[Zech.6|Zechariah 6:1 - Zechariah 6:8]]
*The Vision of the Four Chariots*

[[Zech.6.1|1]] And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains \[were\] mountains of brass.

1: 

[[Zech.6.2|2]] In the first chariot \[were\] red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;

2: 

[[Zech.6.3|3]] And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses.

3: 

[[Zech.6.4|4]] Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What \[are\] these, my lord?

4: 

[[Zech.6.5|5]] And the angel answered and said unto me, These \[are\] the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.

5: 

[[Zech.6.6|6]] The black horses which \[are\] therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country.

6: 

[[Zech.6.7|7]] And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.

7: 

[[Zech.6.8|8]] Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.

8:
