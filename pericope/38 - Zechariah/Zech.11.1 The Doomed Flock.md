[[Zech.11|Zechariah 11:1 - Zechariah 11:9]]
*The Doomed Flock*

[[Zech.11.1|1]] Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.

1: 

[[Zech.11.2|2]] Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.

2: 

[[Zech.11.3|3]] \[There is\] a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.

3: 

[[Zech.11.4|4]] Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;

4: 

[[Zech.11.5|5]] Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed \[be\] the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.

5: 

[[Zech.11.6|6]] For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour’s hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver \[them\].

6: 

[[Zech.11.7|7]] And I will feed the flock of slaughter, \[even\] you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.

7: 

[[Zech.11.8|8]] Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.

8: 

[[Zech.11.9|9]] Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.

9:
