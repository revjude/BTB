[[Zech.1|Zechariah 1:18 - Zechariah 1:21]]
*The Vision of the Horns and the Craftsmen*

[[Zech.1.18|18]] Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.

18: 

[[Zech.1.19|19]] And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What \[be\] these? And he answered me, These \[are\] the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.

19: 

[[Zech.1.20|20]] And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.

20: 

[[Zech.1.21|21]] Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These \[are\] the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up \[their\] horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.

21:
