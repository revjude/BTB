[[Zech.5|Zechariah 5:5 - Zechariah 5:11]]
*The Vision of the Woman in a Basket*

[[Zech.5.5|5]] Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what \[is\] this that goeth forth.

5: 

[[Zech.5.6|6]] And I said, What \[is\] it? And he said, This \[is\] an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This \[is\] their resemblance through all the earth.

6: 

[[Zech.5.7|7]] And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this \[is\] a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.

7: 

[[Zech.5.8|8]] And he said, This \[is\] wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.

8: 

[[Zech.5.9|9]] Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind \[was\] in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.

9: 

[[Zech.5.10|10]] Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah?

10: 

[[Zech.5.11|11]] And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.

11:
