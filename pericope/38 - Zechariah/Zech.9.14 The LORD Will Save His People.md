[[Zech.9|Zechariah 9:14 - Zechariah 9:17]]
*The LORD Will Save His People*

[[Zech.9.14|14]] And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the Lord GOD shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.

14: 

[[Zech.9.15|15]] The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, \[and\] make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, \[and\] as the corners of the altar.

15: 

[[Zech.9.16|16]] And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for \[they shall be as\] the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land.

16: 

[[Zech.9.17|17]] For how great \[is\] his goodness, and how great \[is\] his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.

17:
