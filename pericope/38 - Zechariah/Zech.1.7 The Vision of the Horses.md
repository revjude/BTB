[[Zech.1|Zechariah 1:7 - Zechariah 1:17]]
*The Vision of the Horses*

[[Zech.1.7|7]] Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which \[is\] the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,

7: 

[[Zech.1.8|8]] I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that \[were\] in the bottom; and behind him \[were there\] red horses, speckled, and white.

8: 

[[Zech.1.9|9]] Then said I, O my lord, what \[are\] these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these \[be\].

9: 

[[Zech.1.10|10]] And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These \[are they\] whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.

10: 

[[Zech.1.11|11]] And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.

11: 

[[Zech.1.12|12]] Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?

12: 

[[Zech.1.13|13]] And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me \[with\] good words \[and\] comfortable words.

13: 

[[Zech.1.14|14]] So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.

14: 

[[Zech.1.15|15]] And I am very sore displeased with the heathen \[that are\] at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.

15: 

[[Zech.1.16|16]] Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.

16: 

[[Zech.1.17|17]] Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.

17:
