[[2Sam.13|2 Samuel 13:34 - 2 Samuel 13:39]]
*Absalom Flees to Geshur*

[[2Sam.13.34|34]] But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.

34: 

[[2Sam.13.35|35]] And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.

35: 

[[2Sam.13.36|36]] And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.

36: 

[[2Sam.13.37|37]] But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And \[David\] mourned for his son every day.

37: 

[[2Sam.13.38|38]] So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.

38: 

[[2Sam.13.39|39]] And \[the soul of\] king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.

39:
