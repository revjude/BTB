[[2Sam.22|2 Samuel 22:1 - 2 Samuel 22:51]]
*David’s Song of Deliverance*

[[2Sam.22.1|1]] And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day \[that\] the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:

1: 

[[2Sam.22.2|2]] And he said, The LORD \[is\] my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;

2: 

[[2Sam.22.3|3]] The God of my rock; in him will I trust: \[he is\] my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.

3: 

[[2Sam.22.4|4]] I will call on the LORD, \[who is\] worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.

4: 

[[2Sam.22.5|5]] When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;

5: 

[[2Sam.22.6|6]] The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;

6: 

[[2Sam.22.7|7]] In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry \[did enter\] into his ears.

7: 

[[2Sam.22.8|8]] Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.

8: 

[[2Sam.22.9|9]] There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

9: 

[[2Sam.22.10|10]] He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness \[was\] under his feet.

10: 

[[2Sam.22.11|11]] And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.

11: 

[[2Sam.22.12|12]] And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, \[and\] thick clouds of the skies.

12: 

[[2Sam.22.13|13]] Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.

13: 

[[2Sam.22.14|14]] The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.

14: 

[[2Sam.22.15|15]] And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.

15: 

[[2Sam.22.16|16]] And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.

16: 

[[2Sam.22.17|17]] He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;

17: 

[[2Sam.22.18|18]] He delivered me from my strong enemy, \[and\] from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.

18: 

[[2Sam.22.19|19]] They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.

19: 

[[2Sam.22.20|20]] He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.

20: 

[[2Sam.22.21|21]] The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

21: 

[[2Sam.22.22|22]] For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.

22: 

[[2Sam.22.23|23]] For all his judgments \[were\] before me: and \[as for\] his statutes, I did not depart from them.

23: 

[[2Sam.22.24|24]] I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.

24: 

[[2Sam.22.25|25]] Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.

25: 

[[2Sam.22.26|26]] With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, \[and\] with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.

26: 

[[2Sam.22.27|27]] With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.

27: 

[[2Sam.22.28|28]] And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes \[are\] upon the haughty, \[that\] thou mayest bring \[them\] down.

28: 

[[2Sam.22.29|29]] For thou \[art\] my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.

29: 

[[2Sam.22.30|30]] For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.

30: 

[[2Sam.22.31|31]] \[As for\] God, his way \[is\] perfect; the word of the LORD \[is\] tried: he \[is\] a buckler to all them that trust in him.

31: 

[[2Sam.22.32|32]] For who \[is\] God, save the LORD? and who \[is\] a rock, save our God?

32: 

[[2Sam.22.33|33]] God \[is\] my strength \[and\] power: and he maketh my way perfect.

33: 

[[2Sam.22.34|34]] He maketh my feet like hinds’ \[feet\]: and setteth me upon my high places.

34: 

[[2Sam.22.35|35]] He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.

35: 

[[2Sam.22.36|36]] Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.

36: 

[[2Sam.22.37|37]] Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.

37: 

[[2Sam.22.38|38]] I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.

38: 

[[2Sam.22.39|39]] And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.

39: 

[[2Sam.22.40|40]] For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.

40: 

[[2Sam.22.41|41]] Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.

41: 

[[2Sam.22.42|42]] They looked, but \[there was\] none to save; \[even\] unto the LORD, but he answered them not.

42: 

[[2Sam.22.43|43]] Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, \[and\] did spread them abroad.

43: 

[[2Sam.22.44|44]] Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me \[to be\] head of the heathen: a people \[which\] I knew not shall serve me.

44: 

[[2Sam.22.45|45]] Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.

45: 

[[2Sam.22.46|46]] Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.

46: 

[[2Sam.22.47|47]] The LORD liveth; and blessed \[be\] my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.

47: 

[[2Sam.22.48|48]] It \[is\] God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,

48: 

[[2Sam.22.49|49]] And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.

49: 

[[2Sam.22.50|50]] Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.

50: 

[[2Sam.22.51|51]] \[He is\] the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.
