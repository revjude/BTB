[[2Sam.3|2 Samuel 3:31 - 2 Samuel 3:39]]
*David Mourns for Abner*

[[2Sam.3.31|31]] And David said to Joab, and to all the people that \[were\] with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David \[himself\] followed the bier.

31: 

[[2Sam.3.32|32]] And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.

32: 

[[2Sam.3.33|33]] And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?

33: 

[[2Sam.3.34|34]] Thy hands \[were\] not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, \[so\] fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.

34: 

[[2Sam.3.35|35]] And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.

35: 

[[2Sam.3.36|36]] And all the people took notice \[of it\], and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.

36: 

[[2Sam.3.37|37]] For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.

37: 

[[2Sam.3.38|38]] And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?

38: 

[[2Sam.3.39|39]] And I \[am\] this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah \[be\] too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.

39:
