[[2Sam.3|2 Samuel 3:6 - 2 Samuel 3:21]]
*Abner Joins David*

[[2Sam.3.6|6]] And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.

6: 

[[2Sam.3.7|7]] And Saul had a concubine, whose name \[was\] Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and \[Ishbosheth\] said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father’s concubine?

7: 

[[2Sam.3.8|8]] Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, \[Am\] I a dog’s head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?

8: 

[[2Sam.3.9|9]] So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;

9: 

[[2Sam.3.10|10]] To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.

10: 

[[2Sam.3.11|11]] And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.

11: 

[[2Sam.3.12|12]] And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose \[is\] the land? saying \[also\], Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand \[shall be\] with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.

12: 

[[2Sam.3.13|13]] And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul’s daughter, when thou comest to see my face.

13: 

[[2Sam.3.14|14]] And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul’s son, saying, Deliver \[me\] my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.

14: 

[[2Sam.3.15|15]] And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from \[her\] husband, \[even\] from Phaltiel the son of Laish.

15: 

[[2Sam.3.16|16]] And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.

16: 

[[2Sam.3.17|17]] And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past \[to be\] king over you:

17: 

[[2Sam.3.18|18]] Now then do \[it\]: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.

18: 

[[2Sam.3.19|19]] And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.

19: 

[[2Sam.3.20|20]] So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that \[were\] with him a feast.

20: 

[[2Sam.3.21|21]] And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.

21:
