[[2Sam.19|2 Samuel 19:16 - 2 Samuel 19:23]]
*Shimei Pardoned*

[[2Sam.19.16|16]] And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which \[was\] of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.

16: 

[[2Sam.19.17|17]] And \[there were\] a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.

17: 

[[2Sam.19.18|18]] And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;

18: 

[[2Sam.19.19|19]] And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.

19: 

[[2Sam.19.20|20]] For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.

20: 

[[2Sam.19.21|21]] But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD’S anointed?

21: 

[[2Sam.19.22|22]] And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I \[am\] this day king over Israel?

22: 

[[2Sam.19.23|23]] Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.

23:
