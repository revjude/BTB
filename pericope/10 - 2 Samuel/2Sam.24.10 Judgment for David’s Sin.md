[[2Sam.24|2 Samuel 24:10 - 2 Samuel 24:14]]
*Judgment for David’s Sin*

[[2Sam.24.10|10]] And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.

10: 

[[2Sam.24.11|11]] For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,

11: 

[[2Sam.24.12|12]] Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three \[things\]; choose thee one of them, that I may \[do it\] unto thee.

12: 

[[2Sam.24.13|13]] So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days’ pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.

13: 

[[2Sam.24.14|14]] And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies \[are\] great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.

14:
