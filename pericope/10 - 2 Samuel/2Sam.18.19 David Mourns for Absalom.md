[[2Sam.18|2 Samuel 18:19 - 2 Samuel 18:33]]
*David Mourns for Absalom*

[[2Sam.18.19|19]] Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.

19: 

[[2Sam.18.20|20]] And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king’s son is dead.

20: 

[[2Sam.18.21|21]] Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.

21: 

[[2Sam.18.22|22]] Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?

22: 

[[2Sam.18.23|23]] But howsoever, \[said he\], let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.

23: 

[[2Sam.18.24|24]] And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.

24: 

[[2Sam.18.25|25]] And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he \[be\] alone, \[there is\] tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.

25: 

[[2Sam.18.26|26]] And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold \[another\] man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.

26: 

[[2Sam.18.27|27]] And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He \[is\] a good man, and cometh with good tidings.

27: 

[[2Sam.18.28|28]] And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed \[be\] the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.

28: 

[[2Sam.18.29|29]] And the king said, \[Is\] the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king’s servant, and \[me\] thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what \[it was\].

29: 

[[2Sam.18.30|30]] And the king said \[unto him\], Turn aside, \[and\] stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.

30: 

[[2Sam.18.31|31]] And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.

31: 

[[2Sam.18.32|32]] And the king said unto Cushi, \[Is\] the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do \[thee\] hurt, be as \[that\] young man \[is\].

32: 

[[2Sam.18.33|33]] And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!

33:
