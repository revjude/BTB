[[2Sam.24|2 Samuel 24:1 - 2 Samuel 24:9]]
*David’s Military Census*

[[2Sam.24.1|1]] And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.

1: 

[[2Sam.24.2|2]] For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which \[was\] with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.

2: 

[[2Sam.24.3|3]] And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see \[it\]: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?

3: 

[[2Sam.24.4|4]] Notwithstanding the king’s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.

4: 

[[2Sam.24.5|5]] And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that \[lieth\] in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:

5: 

[[2Sam.24.6|6]] Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,

6: 

[[2Sam.24.7|7]] And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, \[even\] to Beersheba.

7: 

[[2Sam.24.8|8]] So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.

8: 

[[2Sam.24.9|9]] And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah \[were\] five hundred thousand men.

9:
