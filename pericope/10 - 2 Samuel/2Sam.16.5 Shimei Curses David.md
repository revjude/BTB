[[2Sam.16|2 Samuel 16:5 - 2 Samuel 16:14]]
*Shimei Curses David*

[[2Sam.16.5|5]] And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name \[was\] Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.

5: 

[[2Sam.16.6|6]] And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men \[were\] on his right hand and on his left.

6: 

[[2Sam.16.7|7]] And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:

7: 

[[2Sam.16.8|8]] The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou \[art taken\] in thy mischief, because thou \[art\] a bloody man.

8: 

[[2Sam.16.9|9]] Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.

9: 

[[2Sam.16.10|10]] And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?

10: 

[[2Sam.16.11|11]] And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now \[may this\] Benjamite \[do it\]? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.

11: 

[[2Sam.16.12|12]] It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.

12: 

[[2Sam.16.13|13]] And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill’s side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.

13: 

[[2Sam.16.14|14]] And the king, and all the people that \[were\] with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.

14:
