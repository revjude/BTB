[[2Sam.14|2 Samuel 14:28 - 2 Samuel 14:33]]
*Absalom Reconciled to David*

[[2Sam.14.28|28]] So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king’s face.

28: 

[[2Sam.14.29|29]] Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.

29: 

[[2Sam.14.30|30]] Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab’s field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.

30: 

[[2Sam.14.31|31]] Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto \[his\] house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?

31: 

[[2Sam.14.32|32]] And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? \[it had been\] good for me \[to have been\] there still: now therefore let me see the king’s face; and if there be \[any\] iniquity in me, let him kill me.

32: 

[[2Sam.14.33|33]] So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.

33:
