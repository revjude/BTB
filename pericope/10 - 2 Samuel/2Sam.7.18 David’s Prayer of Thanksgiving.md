[[2Sam.7|2 Samuel 7:18 - 2 Samuel 7:29]]
*David’s Prayer of Thanksgiving*

[[2Sam.7.18|18]] Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who \[am\] I, O Lord GOD? and what \[is\] my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?

18: 

[[2Sam.7.19|19]] And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house for a great while to come. And \[is\] this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?

19: 

[[2Sam.7.20|20]] And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.

20: 

[[2Sam.7.21|21]] For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know \[them\].

21: 

[[2Sam.7.22|22]] Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for \[there is\] none like thee, neither \[is there any\] God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.

22: 

[[2Sam.7.23|23]] And what one nation in the earth \[is\] like thy people, \[even\] like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, \[from\] the nations and their gods?

23: 

[[2Sam.7.24|24]] For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel \[to be\] a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.

24: 

[[2Sam.7.25|25]] And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish \[it\] for ever, and do as thou hast said.

25: 

[[2Sam.7.26|26]] And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts \[is\] the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.

26: 

[[2Sam.7.27|27]] For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.

27: 

[[2Sam.7.28|28]] And now, O Lord GOD, thou \[art\] that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:

28: 

[[2Sam.7.29|29]] Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken \[it\]: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.

29:
