[[2Sam.16|2 Samuel 16:15 - 2 Samuel 16:23]]
*The Counsel of Ahithophel and Hushai*

[[2Sam.16.15|15]] And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.

15: 

[[2Sam.16.16|16]] And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.

16: 

[[2Sam.16.17|17]] And Absalom said to Hushai, \[Is\] this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?

17: 

[[2Sam.16.18|18]] And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.

18: 

[[2Sam.16.19|19]] And again, whom should I serve? \[should I\] not \[serve\] in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father’s presence, so will I be in thy presence.

19: 

[[2Sam.16.20|20]] Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.

20: 

[[2Sam.16.21|21]] And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father’s concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that \[are\] with thee be strong.

21: 

[[2Sam.16.22|22]] So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.

22: 

[[2Sam.16.23|23]] And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, \[was\] as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God: so \[was\] all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.

23:
