[[2Sam.15|2 Samuel 15:13 - 2 Samuel 15:29]]
*David Flees Jerusalem*

[[2Sam.15.13|13]] And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.

13: 

[[2Sam.15.14|14]] And David said unto all his servants that \[were\] with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not \[else\] escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.

14: 

[[2Sam.15.15|15]] And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants \[are ready to do\] whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.

15: 

[[2Sam.15.16|16]] And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, \[which were\] concubines, to keep the house.

16: 

[[2Sam.15.17|17]] And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.

17: 

[[2Sam.15.18|18]] And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.

18: 

[[2Sam.15.19|19]] Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou \[art\] a stranger, and also an exile.

19: 

[[2Sam.15.20|20]] Whereas thou camest \[but\] yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth \[be\] with thee.

20: 

[[2Sam.15.21|21]] And Ittai answered the king, and said, \[As\] the LORD liveth, and \[as\] my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.

21: 

[[2Sam.15.22|22]] And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that \[were\] with him.

22: 

[[2Sam.15.23|23]] And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.

23: 

[[2Sam.15.24|24]] And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites \[were\] with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.

24: 

[[2Sam.15.25|25]] And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me \[both\] it, and his habitation:

25: 

[[2Sam.15.26|26]] But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, \[here am\] I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.

26: 

[[2Sam.15.27|27]] The king said also unto Zadok the priest, \[Art not\] thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.

27: 

[[2Sam.15.28|28]] See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.

28: 

[[2Sam.15.29|29]] Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.

29:
