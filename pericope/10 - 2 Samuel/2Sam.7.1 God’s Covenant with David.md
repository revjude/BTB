[[2Sam.7|2 Samuel 7:1 - 2 Samuel 7:17]]
*God’s Covenant with David*

[[2Sam.7.1|1]] And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;

1: 

[[2Sam.7.2|2]] That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.

2: 

[[2Sam.7.3|3]] And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that \[is\] in thine heart; for the LORD \[is\] with thee.

3: 

[[2Sam.7.4|4]] And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,

4: 

[[2Sam.7.5|5]] Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?

5: 

[[2Sam.7.6|6]] Whereas I have not dwelt in \[any\] house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.

6: 

[[2Sam.7.7|7]] In all \[the places\] wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?

7: 

[[2Sam.7.8|8]] Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:

8: 

[[2Sam.7.9|9]] And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great \[men\] that \[are\] in the earth.

9: 

[[2Sam.7.10|10]] Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,

10: 

[[2Sam.7.11|11]] And as since the time that I commanded judges \[to be\] over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.

11: 

[[2Sam.7.12|12]] And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.

12: 

[[2Sam.7.13|13]] He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.

13: 

[[2Sam.7.14|14]] I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:

14: 

[[2Sam.7.15|15]] But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took \[it\] from Saul, whom I put away before thee.

15: 

[[2Sam.7.16|16]] And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.

16: 

[[2Sam.7.17|17]] According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.

17:
