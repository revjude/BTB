[[2Sam.16|2 Samuel 16:1 - 2 Samuel 16:4]]
*David and Ziba*

[[2Sam.16.1|1]] And when David was a little past the top \[of the hill\], behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred \[loaves\] of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.

1: 

[[2Sam.16.2|2]] And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses \[be\] for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.

2: 

[[2Sam.16.3|3]] And the king said, And where \[is\] thy master’s son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.

3: 

[[2Sam.16.4|4]] Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine \[are\] all that \[pertained\] unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee \[that\] I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.
