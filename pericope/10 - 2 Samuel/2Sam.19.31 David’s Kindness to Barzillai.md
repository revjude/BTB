[[2Sam.19|2 Samuel 19:31 - 2 Samuel 19:40]]
*David’s Kindness to Barzillai*

[[2Sam.19.31|31]] And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.

31: 

[[2Sam.19.32|32]] Now Barzillai was a very aged man, \[even\] fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he \[was\] a very great man.

32: 

[[2Sam.19.33|33]] And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.

33: 

[[2Sam.19.34|34]] And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?

34: 

[[2Sam.19.35|35]] I \[am\] this day fourscore years old: \[and\] can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?

35: 

[[2Sam.19.36|36]] Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?

36: 

[[2Sam.19.37|37]] Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, \[and be buried\] by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.

37: 

[[2Sam.19.38|38]] And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, \[that\] will I do for thee.

38: 

[[2Sam.19.39|39]] And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.

39: 

[[2Sam.19.40|40]] Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.

40:
