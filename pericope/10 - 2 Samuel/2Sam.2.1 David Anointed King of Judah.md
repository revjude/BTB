[[2Sam.2|2 Samuel 2:1 - 2 Samuel 2:7]]
*David Anointed King of Judah*

[[2Sam.2.1|1]] And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.

1: 

[[2Sam.2.2|2]] So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal’s wife the Carmelite.

2: 

[[2Sam.2.3|3]] And his men that \[were\] with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.

3: 

[[2Sam.2.4|4]] And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, \[That\] the men of Jabeshgilead \[were they\] that buried Saul.

4: 

[[2Sam.2.5|5]] And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed \[be\] ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, \[even\] unto Saul, and have buried him.

5: 

[[2Sam.2.6|6]] And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.

6: 

[[2Sam.2.7|7]] Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.

7:
