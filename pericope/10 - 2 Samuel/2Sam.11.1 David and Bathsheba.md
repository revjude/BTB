[[2Sam.11|2 Samuel 11:1 - 2 Samuel 11:13]]
*David and Bathsheba*

[[2Sam.11.1|1]] And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth \[to battle\], that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.

1: 

[[2Sam.11.2|2]] And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman \[was\] very beautiful to look upon.

2: 

[[2Sam.11.3|3]] And David sent and inquired after the woman. And \[one\] said, \[Is\] not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?

3: 

[[2Sam.11.4|4]] And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.

4: 

[[2Sam.11.5|5]] And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I \[am\] with child.

5: 

[[2Sam.11.6|6]] And David sent to Joab, \[saying\], Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.

6: 

[[2Sam.11.7|7]] And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded \[of him\] how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.

7: 

[[2Sam.11.8|8]] And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and there followed him a mess \[of meat\] from the king.

8: 

[[2Sam.11.9|9]] But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.

9: 

[[2Sam.11.10|10]] And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from \[thy\] journey? why \[then\] didst thou not go down unto thine house?

10: 

[[2Sam.11.11|11]] And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? \[as\] thou livest, and \[as\] thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.

11: 

[[2Sam.11.12|12]] And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.

12: 

[[2Sam.11.13|13]] And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.

13:
