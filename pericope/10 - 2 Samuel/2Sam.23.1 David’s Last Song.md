[[2Sam.23|2 Samuel 23:1 - 2 Samuel 23:7]]
*David’s Last Song*

[[2Sam.23.1|1]] Now these \[be\] the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man \[who was\] raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,

1: 

[[2Sam.23.2|2]] The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word \[was\] in my tongue.

2: 

[[2Sam.23.3|3]] The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men \[must be\] just, ruling in the fear of God.

3: 

[[2Sam.23.4|4]] And \[he shall be\] as the light of the morning, \[when\] the sun riseth, \[even\] a morning without clouds; \[as\] the tender grass \[springing\] out of the earth by clear shining after rain.

4: 

[[2Sam.23.5|5]] Although my house \[be\] not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all \[things\], and sure: for \[this is\] all my salvation, and all \[my\] desire, although he make \[it\] not to grow.

5: 

[[2Sam.23.6|6]] But \[the sons\] of Belial \[shall be\] all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:

6: 

[[2Sam.23.7|7]] But the man \[that\] shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the \[same\] place.

7:
