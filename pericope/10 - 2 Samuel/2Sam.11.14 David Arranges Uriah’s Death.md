[[2Sam.11|2 Samuel 11:14 - 2 Samuel 11:25]]
*David Arranges Uriah’s Death*

[[2Sam.11.14|14]] And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent \[it\] by the hand of Uriah.

14: 

[[2Sam.11.15|15]] And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.

15: 

[[2Sam.11.16|16]] And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men \[were\].

16: 

[[2Sam.11.17|17]] And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell \[some\] of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.

17: 

[[2Sam.11.18|18]] Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;

18: 

[[2Sam.11.19|19]] And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,

19: 

[[2Sam.11.20|20]] And if so be that the king’s wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?

20: 

[[2Sam.11.21|21]] Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.

21: 

[[2Sam.11.22|22]] So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for.

22: 

[[2Sam.11.23|23]] And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.

23: 

[[2Sam.11.24|24]] And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and \[some\] of the king’s servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.

24: 

[[2Sam.11.25|25]] Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.

25:
