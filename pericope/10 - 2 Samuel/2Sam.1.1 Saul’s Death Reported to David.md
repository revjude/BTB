[[2Sam.1|2 Samuel 1:1 - 2 Samuel 1:16]]
*Saul’s Death Reported to David*

[[2Sam.1.1|1]] Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;

1: 

[[2Sam.1.2|2]] It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and \[so\] it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.

2: 

[[2Sam.1.3|3]] And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.

3: 

[[2Sam.1.4|4]] And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.

4: 

[[2Sam.1.5|5]] And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?

5: 

[[2Sam.1.6|6]] And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.

6: 

[[2Sam.1.7|7]] And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here \[am\] I.

7: 

[[2Sam.1.8|8]] And he said unto me, Who \[art\] thou? And I answered him, I \[am\] an Amalekite.

8: 

[[2Sam.1.9|9]] He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life \[is\] yet whole in me.

9: 

[[2Sam.1.10|10]] So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that \[was\] upon his head, and the bracelet that \[was\] on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.

10: 

[[2Sam.1.11|11]] Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that \[were\] with him:

11: 

[[2Sam.1.12|12]] And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.

12: 

[[2Sam.1.13|13]] And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence \[art\] thou? And he answered, I \[am\] the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.

13: 

[[2Sam.1.14|14]] And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD’S anointed?

14: 

[[2Sam.1.15|15]] And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, \[and\] fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.

15: 

[[2Sam.1.16|16]] And David said unto him, Thy blood \[be\] upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD’S anointed.

16:
