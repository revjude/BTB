[[2Sam.1|2 Samuel 1:17 - 2 Samuel 1:27]]
*David’s Song for Saul and Jonathan*

[[2Sam.1.17|17]] And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:

17: 

[[2Sam.1.18|18]] (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah \[the use of\] the bow: behold, \[it is\] written in the book of Jasher.)

18: 

[[2Sam.1.19|19]] The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!

19: 

[[2Sam.1.20|20]] Tell \[it\] not in Gath, publish \[it\] not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.

20: 

[[2Sam.1.21|21]] Ye mountains of Gilboa, \[let there be\] no dew, neither \[let there be\] rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, \[as though he had\] not \[been\] anointed with oil.

21: 

[[2Sam.1.22|22]] From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.

22: 

[[2Sam.1.23|23]] Saul and Jonathan \[were\] lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.

23: 

[[2Sam.1.24|24]] Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with \[other\] delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.

24: 

[[2Sam.1.25|25]] How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, \[thou wast\] slain in thine high places.

25: 

[[2Sam.1.26|26]] I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.

26: 

[[2Sam.1.27|27]] How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

27:
