[[2Sam.6|2 Samuel 6:5 - 2 Samuel 6:11]]
*Uzzah Touches the Ark*

[[2Sam.6.5|5]] And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of \[instruments made of\] fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.

5: 

[[2Sam.6.6|6]] And when they came to Nachon’s threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth \[his hand\] to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook \[it\].

6: 

[[2Sam.6.7|7]] And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for \[his\] error; and there he died by the ark of God.

7: 

[[2Sam.6.8|8]] And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.

8: 

[[2Sam.6.9|9]] And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?

9: 

[[2Sam.6.10|10]] So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.

10: 

[[2Sam.6.11|11]] And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household.

11:
