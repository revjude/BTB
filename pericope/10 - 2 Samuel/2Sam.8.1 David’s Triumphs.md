*David’s Triumphs*

[[2Sam.8.1|1]] And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the Philistines.

1: 

[[2Sam.8.2|2]] And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And \[so\] the Moabites became David’s servants, \[and\] brought gifts.

2: 

[[2Sam.8.3|3]] David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.

3: 

[[2Sam.8.4|4]] And David took from him a thousand \[chariots\], and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot \[horses\], but reserved of them \[for\] an hundred chariots.

4: 

[[2Sam.8.5|5]] And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.

5: 

[[2Sam.8.6|6]] Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, \[and\] brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

6: 

[[2Sam.8.7|7]] And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

7: 

[[2Sam.8.8|8]] And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.

8: 

[[2Sam.8.9|9]] When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,

9: 

[[2Sam.8.10|10]] Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And \[Joram\] brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:

10: 

[[2Sam.8.11|11]] Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;

11: 

[[2Sam.8.12|12]] Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.

12: 

[[2Sam.8.13|13]] And David gat \[him\] a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, \[being\] eighteen thousand \[men\].

13: 

[[2Sam.8.14|14]] And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David’s servants. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

14:
