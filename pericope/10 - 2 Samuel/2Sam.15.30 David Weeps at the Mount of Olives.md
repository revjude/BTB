[[2Sam.15|2 Samuel 15:30 - 2 Samuel 15:37]]
*David Weeps at the Mount of Olives*

[[2Sam.15.30|30]] And David went up by the ascent of \[mount\] Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that \[was\] with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.

30: 

[[2Sam.15.31|31]] And \[one\] told David, saying, Ahithophel \[is\] among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.

31: 

[[2Sam.15.32|32]] And it came to pass, that \[when\] David was come to the top \[of the mount\], where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:

32: 

[[2Sam.15.33|33]] Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:

33: 

[[2Sam.15.34|34]] But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; \[as\] I \[have been\] thy father’s servant hitherto, so \[will\] I now also \[be\] thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.

34: 

[[2Sam.15.35|35]] And \[hast thou\] not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, \[that\] what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king’s house, thou shalt tell \[it\] to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.

35: 

[[2Sam.15.36|36]] Behold, \[they have\] there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok’s \[son\], and Jonathan Abiathar’s \[son\]; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.

36: 

[[2Sam.15.37|37]] So Hushai David’s friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.

37:
