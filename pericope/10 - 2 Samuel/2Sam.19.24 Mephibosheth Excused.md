[[2Sam.19|2 Samuel 19:24 - 2 Samuel 19:30]]
*Mephibosheth Excused*

[[2Sam.19.24|24]] And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came \[again\] in peace.

24: 

[[2Sam.19.25|25]] And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?

25: 

[[2Sam.19.26|26]] And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant \[is\] lame.

26: 

[[2Sam.19.27|27]] And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king \[is\] as an angel of God: do therefore \[what is\] good in thine eyes.

27: 

[[2Sam.19.28|28]] For all \[of\] my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?

28: 

[[2Sam.19.29|29]] And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.

29: 

[[2Sam.19.30|30]] And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.

30:
