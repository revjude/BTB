[[2Sam.17|2 Samuel 17:1 - 2 Samuel 17:14]]
*Hushai Counters Ahithophel’s Advice*

[[2Sam.17.1|1]] Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:

1: 

[[2Sam.17.2|2]] And I will come upon him while he \[is\] weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that \[are\] with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:

2: 

[[2Sam.17.3|3]] And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest \[is\] as if all returned: \[so\] all the people shall be in peace.

3: 

[[2Sam.17.4|4]] And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.

4: 

[[2Sam.17.5|5]] Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.

5: 

[[2Sam.17.6|6]] And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do \[after\] his saying? if not; speak thou.

6: 

[[2Sam.17.7|7]] And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given \[is\] not good at this time.

7: 

[[2Sam.17.8|8]] For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they \[be\] mighty men, and they \[be\] chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father \[is\] a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.

8: 

[[2Sam.17.9|9]] Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some \[other\] place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.

9: 

[[2Sam.17.10|10]] And he also \[that is\] valiant, whose heart \[is\] as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father \[is\] a mighty man, and \[they\] which \[be\] with him \[are\] valiant men.

10: 

[[2Sam.17.11|11]] Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that \[is\] by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.

11: 

[[2Sam.17.12|12]] So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that \[are\] with him there shall not be left so much as one.

12: 

[[2Sam.17.13|13]] Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.

13: 

[[2Sam.17.14|14]] And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite \[is\] better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.

14:
