[[2Sam.13|2 Samuel 13:1 - 2 Samuel 13:22]]
*Amnon and Tamar*

[[2Sam.13.1|1]] And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name \[was\] Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.

1: 

[[2Sam.13.2|2]] And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she \[was\] a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her.

2: 

[[2Sam.13.3|3]] But Amnon had a friend, whose name \[was\] Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother: and Jonadab \[was\] a very subtil man.

3: 

[[2Sam.13.4|4]] And he said unto him, Why \[art\] thou, \[being\] the king’s son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.

4: 

[[2Sam.13.5|5]] And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see \[it\], and eat \[it\] at her hand.

5: 

[[2Sam.13.6|6]] So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.

6: 

[[2Sam.13.7|7]] Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and dress him meat.

7: 

[[2Sam.13.8|8]] So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded \[it\], and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.

8: 

[[2Sam.13.9|9]] And she took a pan, and poured \[them\] out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.

9: 

[[2Sam.13.10|10]] And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought \[them\] into the chamber to Amnon her brother.

10: 

[[2Sam.13.11|11]] And when she had brought \[them\] unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.

11: 

[[2Sam.13.12|12]] And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.

12: 

[[2Sam.13.13|13]] And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.

13: 

[[2Sam.13.14|14]] Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.

14: 

[[2Sam.13.15|15]] Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her \[was\] greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.

15: 

[[2Sam.13.16|16]] And she said unto him, \[There is\] no cause: this evil in sending me away \[is\] greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.

16: 

[[2Sam.13.17|17]] Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this \[woman\] out from me, and bolt the door after her.

17: 

[[2Sam.13.18|18]] And \[she had\] a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king’s daughters \[that were\] virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.

18: 

[[2Sam.13.19|19]] And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that \[was\] on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.

19: 

[[2Sam.13.20|20]] And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he \[is\] thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house.

20: 

[[2Sam.13.21|21]] But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.

21: 

[[2Sam.13.22|22]] And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.

22:
