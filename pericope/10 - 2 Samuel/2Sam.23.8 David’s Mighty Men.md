[[2Sam.23|2 Samuel 23:8 - 2 Samuel 23:39]]
*David’s Mighty Men*

[[2Sam.23.8|8]] These \[be\] the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same \[was\] Adino the Eznite: \[he lift up his spear\] against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.

8: 

[[2Sam.23.9|9]] And after him \[was\] Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, \[one\] of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines \[that\] were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:

9: 

[[2Sam.23.10|10]] He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.

10: 

[[2Sam.23.11|11]] And after him \[was\] Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.

11: 

[[2Sam.23.12|12]] But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.

12: 

[[2Sam.23.13|13]] And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.

13: 

[[2Sam.23.14|14]] And David \[was\] then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines \[was\] then \[in\] Bethlehem.

14: 

[[2Sam.23.15|15]] And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which \[is\] by the gate!

15: 

[[2Sam.23.16|16]] And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that \[was\] by the gate, and took \[it\], and brought \[it\] to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.

16: 

[[2Sam.23.17|17]] And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: \[is not this\] the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.

17: 

[[2Sam.23.18|18]] And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, \[and\] slew \[them\], and had the name among three.

18: 

[[2Sam.23.19|19]] Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the \[first\] three.

19: 

[[2Sam.23.20|20]] And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:

20: 

[[2Sam.23.21|21]] And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.

21: 

[[2Sam.23.22|22]] These \[things\] did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.

22: 

[[2Sam.23.23|23]] He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the \[first\] three. And David set him over his guard.

23:
