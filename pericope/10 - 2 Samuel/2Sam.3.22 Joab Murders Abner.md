[[2Sam.3|2 Samuel 3:22 - 2 Samuel 3:30]]
*Joab Murders Abner*

[[2Sam.3.22|22]] And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from \[pursuing\] a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner \[was\] not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.

22: 

[[2Sam.3.23|23]] When Joab and all the host that \[was\] with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.

23: 

[[2Sam.3.24|24]] Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why \[is\] it \[that\] thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?

24: 

[[2Sam.3.25|25]] Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.

25: 

[[2Sam.3.26|26]] And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew \[it\] not.

26: 

[[2Sam.3.27|27]] And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth \[rib\], that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.

27: 

[[2Sam.3.28|28]] And afterward when David heard \[it\], he said, I and my kingdom \[are\] guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:

28: 

[[2Sam.3.29|29]] Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father’s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.

29: 

[[2Sam.3.30|30]] So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.

30:
