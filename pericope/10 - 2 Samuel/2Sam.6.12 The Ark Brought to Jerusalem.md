*The Ark Brought to Jerusalem*

[[2Sam.6.12|12]] And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that \[pertaineth\] unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.

12: 

[[2Sam.6.13|13]] And it was \[so\], that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.

13: 

[[2Sam.6.14|14]] And David danced before the LORD with all \[his\] might; and David \[was\] girded with a linen ephod.

14: 

[[2Sam.6.15|15]] So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
