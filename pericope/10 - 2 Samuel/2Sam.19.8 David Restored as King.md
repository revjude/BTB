[[2Sam.19|2 Samuel 19:8 - 2 Samuel 19:15]]
*David Restored as King*

[[2Sam.19.8|8]] Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.

8: 

[[2Sam.19.9|9]] And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.

9: 

[[2Sam.19.10|10]] And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?

10: 

[[2Sam.19.11|11]] And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, \[even\] to his house.

11: 

[[2Sam.19.12|12]] Ye \[are\] my brethren, ye \[are\] my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?

12: 

[[2Sam.19.13|13]] And say ye to Amasa, \[Art\] thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.

13: 

[[2Sam.19.14|14]] And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as \[the heart of\] one man; so that they sent \[this word\] unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.

14: 

[[2Sam.19.15|15]] So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.
