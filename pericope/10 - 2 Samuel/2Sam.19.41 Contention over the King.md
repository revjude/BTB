[[2Sam.19|2 Samuel 19:41 - 2 Samuel 19:43]]
*Contention over the King*

[[2Sam.19.41|41]] And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David’s men with him, over Jordan?

41: 

[[2Sam.19.42|42]] And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king \[is\] near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king’s \[cost\]? or hath he given us any gift?

42: 

[[2Sam.19.43|43]] And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more \[right\] in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.

43:
