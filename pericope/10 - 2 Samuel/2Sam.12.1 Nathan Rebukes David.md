[[2Sam.12|2 Samuel 12:1 - 2 Samuel 12:12]]
*Nathan Rebukes David*

[[2Sam.12.1|1]] And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.

1: 

[[2Sam.12.2|2]] The rich \[man\] had exceeding many flocks and herds:

2: 

[[2Sam.12.3|3]] But the poor \[man\] had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.

3: 

[[2Sam.12.4|4]] And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.

4: 

[[2Sam.12.5|5]] And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, \[As\] the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this \[thing\] shall surely die:

5: 

[[2Sam.12.6|6]] And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.

6: 

[[2Sam.12.7|7]] And Nathan said to David, Thou \[art\] the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;

7: 

[[2Sam.12.8|8]] And I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if \[that had been\] too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.

8: 

[[2Sam.12.9|9]] Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife \[to be\] thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.

9: 

[[2Sam.12.10|10]] Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.

10: 

[[2Sam.12.11|11]] Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give \[them\] unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.

11: 

[[2Sam.12.12|12]] For thou didst \[it\] secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.

12:
