[[2Sam.13|2 Samuel 13:23 - 2 Samuel 13:33]]
*Absalom’s Revenge on Amnon*

[[2Sam.13.23|23]] And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which \[is\] beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.

23: 

[[2Sam.13.24|24]] And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.

24: 

[[2Sam.13.25|25]] And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.

25: 

[[2Sam.13.26|26]] Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?

26: 

[[2Sam.13.27|27]] But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.

27: 

[[2Sam.13.28|28]] Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.

28: 

[[2Sam.13.29|29]] And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.

29: 

[[2Sam.13.30|30]] And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left.

30: 

[[2Sam.13.31|31]] Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.

31: 

[[2Sam.13.32|32]] And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose \[that\] they have slain all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.

32: 

[[2Sam.13.33|33]] Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.

33:
