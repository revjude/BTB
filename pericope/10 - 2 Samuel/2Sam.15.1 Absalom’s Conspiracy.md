[[2Sam.15|2 Samuel 15:1 - 2 Samuel 15:12]]
*Absalom’s Conspiracy*

[[2Sam.15.1|1]] And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.

1: 

[[2Sam.15.2|2]] And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was \[so\], that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city \[art\] thou? And he said, Thy servant \[is\] of one of the tribes of Israel.

2: 

[[2Sam.15.3|3]] And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters \[are\] good and right; but \[there is\] no man \[deputed\] of the king to hear thee.

3: 

[[2Sam.15.4|4]] Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!

4: 

[[2Sam.15.5|5]] And it was \[so\], that when any man came nigh \[to him\] to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.

5: 

[[2Sam.15.6|6]] And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.

6: 

[[2Sam.15.7|7]] And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.

7: 

[[2Sam.15.8|8]] For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.

8: 

[[2Sam.15.9|9]] And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.

9: 

[[2Sam.15.10|10]] But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.

10: 

[[2Sam.15.11|11]] And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, \[that were\] called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.

11: 

[[2Sam.15.12|12]] And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counseller, from his city, \[even\] from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.

12:
