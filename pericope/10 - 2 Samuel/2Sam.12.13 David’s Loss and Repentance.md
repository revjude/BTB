[[2Sam.12|2 Samuel 12:13 - 2 Samuel 12:23]]
*David’s Loss and Repentance*

[[2Sam.12.13|13]] And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.

13: 

[[2Sam.12.14|14]] Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also \[that is\] born unto thee shall surely die.

14: 

[[2Sam.12.15|15]] And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah’s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.

15: 

[[2Sam.12.16|16]] David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.

16: 

[[2Sam.12.17|17]] And the elders of his house arose, \[and went\] to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.

17: 

[[2Sam.12.18|18]] And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?

18: 

[[2Sam.12.19|19]] But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.

19: 

[[2Sam.12.20|20]] Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed \[himself\], and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.

20: 

[[2Sam.12.21|21]] Then said his servants unto him, What thing \[is\] this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, \[while it was\] alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.

21: 

[[2Sam.12.22|22]] And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell \[whether\] GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?

22: 

[[2Sam.12.23|23]] But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.

23:
