[[2Sam.5|2 Samuel 5:6 - 2 Samuel 5:11]]
*David Conquers Jerusalem*

[[2Sam.5.6|6]] And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.

6: 

[[2Sam.5.7|7]] Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same \[is\] the city of David.

7: 

[[2Sam.5.8|8]] And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, \[that are\] hated of David’s soul, \[he shall be chief and captain\]. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.

8: 

[[2Sam.5.9|9]] So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.

9: 

[[2Sam.5.10|10]] And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts \[was\] with him.

10: 

[[2Sam.5.11|11]] And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.

11:
