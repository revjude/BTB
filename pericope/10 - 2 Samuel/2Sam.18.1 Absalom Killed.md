[[2Sam.18|2 Samuel 18:1 - 2 Samuel 18:18]]
*Absalom Killed*

[[2Sam.18.1|1]] And David numbered the people that \[were\] with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.

1: 

[[2Sam.18.2|2]] And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.

2: 

[[2Sam.18.3|3]] But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now \[thou art\] worth ten thousand of us: therefore now \[it is\] better that thou succour us out of the city.

3: 

[[2Sam.18.4|4]] And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.

4: 

[[2Sam.18.5|5]] And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, \[Deal\] gently for my sake with the young man, \[even\] with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.

5: 

[[2Sam.18.6|6]] So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;

6: 

[[2Sam.18.7|7]] Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand \[men\].

7: 

[[2Sam.18.8|8]] For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.

8: 

[[2Sam.18.9|9]] And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that \[was\] under him went away.

9: 

[[2Sam.18.10|10]] And a certain man saw \[it\], and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.

10: 

[[2Sam.18.11|11]] And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest \[him\], and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten \[shekels\] of silver, and a girdle.

11: 

[[2Sam.18.12|12]] And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand \[shekels\] of silver in mine hand, \[yet\] would I not put forth mine hand against the king’s son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none \[touch\] the young man Absalom.

12: 

[[2Sam.18.13|13]] Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against \[me\].

13: 

[[2Sam.18.14|14]] Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he \[was\] yet alive in the midst of the oak.

14: 

[[2Sam.18.15|15]] And ten young men that bare Joab’s armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.

15: 

[[2Sam.18.16|16]] And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.

16: 

[[2Sam.18.17|17]] And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.

17: 

[[2Sam.18.18|18]] Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which \[is\] in the king’s dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom’s place.

18:
