[[2Sam.12|2 Samuel 12:26 - 2 Samuel 12:31]]
*The Capture of Rabbah*

[[2Sam.12.26|26]] And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.

26: 

[[2Sam.12.27|27]] And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.

27: 

[[2Sam.12.28|28]] Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.

28: 

[[2Sam.12.29|29]] And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.

29: 

[[2Sam.12.30|30]] And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight whereof \[was\] a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was \[set\] on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.

30: 

[[2Sam.12.31|31]] And he brought forth the people that \[were\] therein, and put \[them\] under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.

31:
