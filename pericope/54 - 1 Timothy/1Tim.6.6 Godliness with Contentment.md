[[1Tim.6|1 Timothy 6:6 - 1 Timothy 6:10]]
*Godliness with Contentment*

[[1Tim.6.6|6]] But godliness with contentment is great gain.

6: 

[[1Tim.6.7|7]] For we brought nothing into \[this\] world, \[and it is\] certain we can carry nothing out.

7: 

[[1Tim.6.8|8]] And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.

8: 

[[1Tim.6.9|9]] But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and \[into\] many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.

9: 

[[1Tim.6.10|10]] For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

10:
