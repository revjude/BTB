[[1Tim.5|1 Timothy 5:21 - 1 Timothy 5:25]]
*A Charge to Timothy*

[[1Tim.5.21|21]] I charge \[thee\] before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.

21: 

[[1Tim.5.22|22]] Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure.

22: 

[[1Tim.5.23|23]] Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities.

23: 

[[1Tim.5.24|24]] Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some \[men\] they follow after.

24: 

[[1Tim.5.25|25]] Likewise also the good works \[of some\] are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.

25:
