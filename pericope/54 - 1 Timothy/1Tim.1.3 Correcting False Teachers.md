[[1Tim.1|1 Timothy 1:3 - 1 Timothy 1:11]]
*Correcting False Teachers*

[[1Tim.1.3|3]] As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,

3: 

[[1Tim.1.4|4]] Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: \[so do\].

4: 

[[1Tim.1.5|5]] Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and \[of\] a good conscience, and \[of\] faith unfeigned:

5: 

[[1Tim.1.6|6]] From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;

6: 

[[1Tim.1.7|7]] Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.

7: 

[[1Tim.1.8|8]] But we know that the law \[is\] good, if a man use it lawfully;

8: 

[[1Tim.1.9|9]] Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,

9: 

[[1Tim.1.10|10]] For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;

10: 

[[1Tim.1.11|11]] According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.

11:
