[[1Tim.3|1 Timothy 3:8 - 1 Timothy 3:13]]
*Qualifications for Deacons*

[[1Tim.3.8|8]] Likewise \[must\] the deacons \[be\] grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;

8: 

[[1Tim.3.9|9]] Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.

9: 

[[1Tim.3.10|10]] And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being \[found\] blameless.

10: 

[[1Tim.3.11|11]] Even so \[must their\] wives \[be\] grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.

11: 

[[1Tim.3.12|12]] Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.

12: 

[[1Tim.3.13|13]] For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.

13:
