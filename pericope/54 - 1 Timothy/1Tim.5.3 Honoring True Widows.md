[[1Tim.5|1 Timothy 5:3 - 1 Timothy 5:16]]
*Honoring True Widows*

[[1Tim.5.3|3]] Honour widows that are widows indeed.

3: 

[[1Tim.5.4|4]] But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.

4: 

[[1Tim.5.5|5]] Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.

5: 

[[1Tim.5.6|6]] But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.

6: 

[[1Tim.5.7|7]] And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.

7: 

[[1Tim.5.8|8]] But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.

8: 

[[1Tim.5.9|9]] Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,

9: 

[[1Tim.5.10|10]] Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints’ feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.

10: 

[[1Tim.5.11|11]] But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;

11: 

[[1Tim.5.12|12]] Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.

12: 

[[1Tim.5.13|13]] And withal they learn \[to be\] idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.

13: 

[[1Tim.5.14|14]] I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.

14: 

[[1Tim.5.15|15]] For some are already turned aside after Satan.

15: 

[[1Tim.5.16|16]] If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.

16:
