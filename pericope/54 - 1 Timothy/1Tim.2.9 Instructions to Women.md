*Instructions to Women*

[[1Tim.2.9|9]] In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;

9: 

[[1Tim.2.10|10]] But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.

10:

15:
