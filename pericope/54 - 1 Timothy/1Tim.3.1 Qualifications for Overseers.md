[[1Tim.3|1 Timothy 3:1 - 1 Timothy 3:7]]
*Qualifications for Overseers*

[[1Tim.3.1|1]] This \[is\] a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.

1: 

[[1Tim.3.2|2]] A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;

2: 

[[1Tim.3.3|3]] Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;

3: 

[[1Tim.3.4|4]] One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;

4: 

[[1Tim.3.5|5]] (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)

5: 

[[1Tim.3.6|6]] Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.

6: 

[[1Tim.3.7|7]] Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
