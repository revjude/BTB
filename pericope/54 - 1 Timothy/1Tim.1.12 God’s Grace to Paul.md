[[1Tim.1|1 Timothy 1:12 - 1 Timothy 1:20]]
*God’s Grace to Paul*

[[1Tim.1.12|12]] And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;

12: 

[[1Tim.1.13|13]] Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did \[it\] ignorantly in unbelief.

13: 

[[1Tim.1.14|14]] And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

14: 

[[1Tim.1.15|15]] This \[is\] a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.

15: 

[[1Tim.1.16|16]] Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.

16: 

[[1Tim.1.17|17]] Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, \[be\] honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

17: 

[[1Tim.1.18|18]] This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;

18: 

[[1Tim.1.19|19]] Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:

19: 

[[1Tim.1.20|20]] Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.

20:
