[[1Tim.6|1 Timothy 6:11 - 1 Timothy 6:16]]
*Fight the Good Fight*

[[1Tim.6.11|11]] But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.

11: 

[[1Tim.6.12|12]] Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.

12: 

[[1Tim.6.13|13]] I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and \[before\] Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;

13: 

[[1Tim.6.14|14]] That thou keep \[this\] commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:

14: 

[[1Tim.6.15|15]] Which in his times he shall shew, \[who is\] the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;

15: 

[[1Tim.6.16|16]] Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom \[be\] honour and power everlasting. Amen.

16:
