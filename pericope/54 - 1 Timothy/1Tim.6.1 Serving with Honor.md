[[1Tim.6|1 Timothy 6:1 - 1 Timothy 6:2]]
*Serving with Honor*

[[1Tim.6.1|1]] Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and \[his\] doctrine be not blasphemed.

1: 

[[1Tim.6.2|2]] And they that have believing masters, let them not despise \[them\], because they are brethren; but rather do \[them\] service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.

2:
