[[1Tim.2|1 Timothy 2:1 - 1 Timothy 2:8]]
*A Call to Prayer*

[[1Tim.2.1|1]] I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, \[and\] giving of thanks, be made for all men;

1: 

[[1Tim.2.2|2]] For kings, and \[for\] all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.

2: 

[[1Tim.2.3|3]] For this \[is\] good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;

3: 

[[1Tim.2.4|4]] Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

4: 

[[1Tim.2.5|5]] For \[there is\] one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;

5: 

[[1Tim.2.6|6]] Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.

6: 

[[1Tim.2.7|7]] Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, \[and\] lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.

7: 

[[1Tim.2.8|8]] I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.

8:
