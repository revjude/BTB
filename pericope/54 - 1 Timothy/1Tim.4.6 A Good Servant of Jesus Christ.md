[[1Tim.4|1 Timothy 4:6 - 1 Timothy 4:16]]
*A Good Servant of Jesus Christ*

[[1Tim.4.6|6]] If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.

6: 

[[1Tim.4.7|7]] But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself \[rather\] unto godliness.

7: 

[[1Tim.4.8|8]] For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.

8: 

[[1Tim.4.9|9]] This \[is\] a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.

9: 

[[1Tim.4.10|10]] For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.

10: 

[[1Tim.4.11|11]] These things command and teach.

11: 

[[1Tim.4.12|12]] Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.

12: 

[[1Tim.4.13|13]] Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.

13: 

[[1Tim.4.14|14]] Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.

14: 

[[1Tim.4.15|15]] Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.

15: 

[[1Tim.4.16|16]] Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.

16:
