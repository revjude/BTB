[[Num.9|Numbers 9:1 - Numbers 9:14]]
*The Second Passover*

[[Num.9.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,

1: 

[[Num.9.2|2]] Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.

2: 

[[Num.9.3|3]] In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.

3: 

[[Num.9.4|4]] And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.

4: 

[[Num.9.5|5]] And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.

5: 

[[Num.9.6|6]] And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:

6: 

[[Num.9.7|7]] And those men said unto him, We \[are\] defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?

7: 

[[Num.9.8|8]] And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.

8: 

[[Num.9.9|9]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

9: 

[[Num.9.10|10]] Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or \[be\] in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.

10: 

[[Num.9.11|11]] The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, \[and\] eat it with unleavened bread and bitter \[herbs\].

11: 

[[Num.9.12|12]] They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.

12: 

[[Num.9.13|13]] But the man that \[is\] clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.

13: 

[[Num.9.14|14]] And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.

14:
