[[Num.27|Numbers 27:12 - Numbers 27:17]]
*Moses Requests a Successor*

[[Num.27.12|12]] And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel.

12: 

[[Num.27.13|13]] And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.

13: 

[[Num.27.14|14]] For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that \[is\] the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.

14: 

[[Num.27.15|15]] And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying,

15: 

[[Num.27.16|16]] Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation,

16: 

[[Num.27.17|17]] Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.

17:
