*The Feast of Trumpets*

[[Num.29.1|1]] And in the seventh month, on the first \[day\] of the month, ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work: it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you.

1: 

[[Num.29.2|2]] And ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD; one young bullock, one ram, \[and\] seven lambs of the first year without blemish:

2: 

[[Num.29.3|3]] And their meat offering \[shall be of\] flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals for a bullock, \[and\] two tenth deals for a ram,

3: 

[[Num.29.4|4]] And one tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs:

4: 

[[Num.29.5|5]] And one kid of the goats \[for\] a sin offering, to make an atonement for you:

5: 

[[Num.29.6|6]] Beside the burnt offering of the month, and his meat offering, and the daily burnt offering, and his meat offering, and their drink offerings, according unto their manner, for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

6:
