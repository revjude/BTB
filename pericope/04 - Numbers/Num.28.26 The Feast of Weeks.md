[[Num.28|Numbers 28:26 - Numbers 28:31]]
*The Feast of Weeks*

[[Num.28.26|26]] Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD, after your weeks \[be out\], ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:

26: 

[[Num.28.27|27]] But ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year;

27: 

[[Num.28.28|28]] And their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals unto one bullock, two tenth deals unto one ram,

28: 

[[Num.28.29|29]] A several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven lambs;

29: 

[[Num.28.30|30]] \[And\] one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you.

30: 

[[Num.28.31|31]] Ye shall offer \[them\] beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, (they shall be unto you without blemish) and their drink offerings.

31:
