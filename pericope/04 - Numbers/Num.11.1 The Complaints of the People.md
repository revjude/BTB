[[Num.11|Numbers 11:1 - Numbers 11:9]]
*The Complaints of the People*

[[Num.11.1|1]] And \[when\] the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard \[it\]; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed \[them that were\] in the uttermost parts of the camp.

1: 

[[Num.11.2|2]] And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched.

2: 

[[Num.11.3|3]] And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.

3: 

[[Num.11.4|4]] And the mixt multitude that \[was\] among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?

4: 

[[Num.11.5|5]] We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:

5: 

[[Num.11.6|6]] But now our soul \[is\] dried away: \[there is\] nothing at all, beside this manna, \[before\] our eyes.

6: 

[[Num.11.7|7]] And the manna \[was\] as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium.

7: 

[[Num.11.8|8]] \[And\] the people went about, and gathered \[it\], and ground \[it\] in mills, or beat \[it\] in a mortar, and baked \[it\] in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.

8: 

[[Num.11.9|9]] And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.

9:
