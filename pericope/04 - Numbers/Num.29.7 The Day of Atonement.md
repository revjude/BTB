*The Day of Atonement*

[[Num.29.7|7]] And ye shall have on the tenth \[day\] of this seventh month an holy convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls: ye shall not do any work \[therein\]:

7: 

[[Num.29.8|8]] But ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD \[for\] a sweet savour; one young bullock, one ram, \[and\] seven lambs of the first year; they shall be unto you without blemish:

8: 

[[Num.29.9|9]] And their meat offering \[shall be of\] flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals to a bullock, \[and\] two tenth deals to one ram,

9: 

[[Num.29.10|10]] A several tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs:

10: 

[[Num.29.11|11]] One kid of the goats \[for\] a sin offering; beside the sin offering of atonement, and the continual burnt offering, and the meat offering of it, and their drink offerings.

11:
