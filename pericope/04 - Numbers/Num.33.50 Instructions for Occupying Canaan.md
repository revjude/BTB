[[Num.33|Numbers 33:50 - Numbers 33:56]]
*Instructions for Occupying Canaan*

[[Num.33.50|50]] And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan \[near\] Jericho, saying,

50: 

[[Num.33.51|51]] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;

51: 

[[Num.33.52|52]] Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:

52: 

[[Num.33.53|53]] And ye shall dispossess \[the inhabitants of\] the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.

53: 

[[Num.33.54|54]] And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: \[and\] to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man’s \[inheritance\] shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.

54: 

[[Num.33.55|55]] But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them \[shall be\] pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.

55: 

[[Num.33.56|56]] Moreover it shall come to pass, \[that\] I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them.

56:
