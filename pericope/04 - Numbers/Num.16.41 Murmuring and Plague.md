[[Num.16|Numbers 16:41 - Numbers 16:50]]
*Murmuring and Plague*

[[Num.16.41|41]] But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD.

41: 

[[Num.16.42|42]] And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.

42: 

[[Num.16.43|43]] And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.

43: 

[[Num.16.44|44]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

44: 

[[Num.16.45|45]] Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.

45: 

[[Num.16.46|46]] And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.

46: 

[[Num.16.47|47]] And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.

47: 

[[Num.16.48|48]] And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.

48: 

[[Num.16.49|49]] Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.

49: 

[[Num.16.50|50]] And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.

50:
