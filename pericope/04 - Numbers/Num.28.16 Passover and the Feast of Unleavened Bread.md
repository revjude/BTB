[[Num.28|Numbers 28:16 - Numbers 28:25]]
*Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread*

[[Num.28.16|16]] And in the fourteenth day of the first month \[is\] the passover of the LORD.

16: 

[[Num.28.17|17]] And in the fifteenth day of this month \[is\] the feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.

17: 

[[Num.28.18|18]] In the first day \[shall be\] an holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work \[therein\]:

18: 

[[Num.28.19|19]] But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire \[for\] a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you without blemish:

19: 

[[Num.28.20|20]] And their meat offering \[shall be of\] flour mingled with oil: three tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram;

20: 

[[Num.28.21|21]] A several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb, throughout the seven lambs:

21: 

[[Num.28.22|22]] And one goat \[for\] a sin offering, to make an atonement for you.

22: 

[[Num.28.23|23]] Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning, which \[is\] for a continual burnt offering.

23: 

[[Num.28.24|24]] After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven days, the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

24: 

[[Num.28.25|25]] And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.

25:
