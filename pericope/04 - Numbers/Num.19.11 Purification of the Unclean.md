[[Num.19|Numbers 19:11 - Numbers 19:22]]
*Purification of the Unclean*

[[Num.19.11|11]] He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.

11: 

[[Num.19.12|12]] He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.

12: 

[[Num.19.13|13]] Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness \[is\] yet upon him.

13: 

[[Num.19.14|14]] This \[is\] the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that \[is\] in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.

14: 

[[Num.19.15|15]] And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, \[is\] unclean.

15: 

[[Num.19.16|16]] And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.

16: 

[[Num.19.17|17]] And for an unclean \[person\] they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:

17: 

[[Num.19.18|18]] And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip \[it\] in the water, and sprinkle \[it\] upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:

18: 

[[Num.19.19|19]] And the clean \[person\] shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.

19: 

[[Num.19.20|20]] But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he \[is\] unclean.

20: 

[[Num.19.21|21]] And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.

21: 

[[Num.19.22|22]] And whatsoever the unclean \[person\] toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth \[it\] shall be unclean until even.

22:
