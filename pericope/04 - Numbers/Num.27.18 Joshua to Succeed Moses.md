*Joshua to Succeed Moses*

[[Num.27.18|18]] And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom \[is\] the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;

18: 

[[Num.27.19|19]] And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.

19: 

[[Num.27.20|20]] And thou shalt put \[some\] of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.

20: 

[[Num.27.21|21]] And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask \[counsel\] for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, \[both\] he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.

21: 

[[Num.27.22|22]] And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:

22: 

[[Num.27.23|23]] And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.
