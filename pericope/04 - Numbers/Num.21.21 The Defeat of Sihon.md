[[Num.21|Numbers 21:21 - Numbers 21:30]]
*The Defeat of Sihon*

[[Num.21.21|21]] And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,

21: 

[[Num.21.22|22]] Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink \[of\] the waters of the well: \[but\] we will go along by the king’s \[high\] way, until we be past thy borders.

22: 

[[Num.21.23|23]] And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.

23: 

[[Num.21.24|24]] And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon \[was\] strong.

24: 

[[Num.21.25|25]] And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.

25: 

[[Num.21.26|26]] For Heshbon \[was\] the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.

26: 

[[Num.21.27|27]] Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:

27: 

[[Num.21.28|28]] For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, \[and\] the lords of the high places of Arnon.

28: 

[[Num.21.29|29]] Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.

29: 

[[Num.21.30|30]] We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which \[reacheth\] unto Medeba.

30:
