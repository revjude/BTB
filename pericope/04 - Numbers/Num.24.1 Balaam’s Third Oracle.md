[[Num.24|Numbers 24:1 - Numbers 24:9]]
*Balaam’s Third Oracle*

[[Num.24.1|1]] And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.

1: 

[[Num.24.2|2]] And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding \[in his tents\] according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.

2: 

[[Num.24.3|3]] And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:

3: 

[[Num.24.4|4]] He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling \[into a trance\], but having his eyes open:

4: 

[[Num.24.5|5]] How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, \[and\] thy tabernacles, O Israel!

5: 

[[Num.24.6|6]] As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river’s side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, \[and\] as cedar trees beside the waters.

6: 

[[Num.24.7|7]] He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed \[shall be\] in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.

7: 

[[Num.24.8|8]] God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce \[them\] through with his arrows.

8: 

[[Num.24.9|9]] He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed \[is\] he that blesseth thee, and cursed \[is\] he that curseth thee.

9:
