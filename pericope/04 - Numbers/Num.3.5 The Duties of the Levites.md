[[Num.3|Numbers 3:5 - Numbers 3:13]]
*The Duties of the Levites*

[[Num.3.5|5]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

5: 

[[Num.3.6|6]] Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him.

6: 

[[Num.3.7|7]] And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the service of the tabernacle.

7: 

[[Num.3.8|8]] And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle.

8: 

[[Num.3.9|9]] And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they \[are\] wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel.

9: 

[[Num.3.10|10]] And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait on their priest’s office: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

10: 

[[Num.3.11|11]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

11: 

[[Num.3.12|12]] And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall be mine;

12: 

[[Num.3.13|13]] Because all the firstborn \[are\] mine; \[for\] on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall they be: I \[am\] the LORD.

13:
