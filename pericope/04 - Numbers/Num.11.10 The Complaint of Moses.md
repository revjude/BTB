[[Num.11|Numbers 11:10 - Numbers 11:15]]
*The Complaint of Moses*

[[Num.11.10|10]] Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.

10: 

[[Num.11.11|11]] And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?

11: 

[[Num.11.12|12]] Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?

12: 

[[Num.11.13|13]] Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.

13: 

[[Num.11.14|14]] I am not able to bear all this people alone, because \[it is\] too heavy for me.

14: 

[[Num.11.15|15]] And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.

15:
