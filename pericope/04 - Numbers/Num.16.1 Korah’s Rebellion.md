[[Num.16|Numbers 16:1 - Numbers 16:22]]
*Korah’s Rebellion*

[[Num.16.1|1]] Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took \[men\]:

1: 

[[Num.16.2|2]] And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:

2: 

[[Num.16.3|3]] And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, \[Ye take\] too much upon you, seeing all the congregation \[are\] holy, every one of them, and the LORD \[is\] among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?

3: 

[[Num.16.4|4]] And when Moses heard \[it\], he fell upon his face:

4: 

[[Num.16.5|5]] And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will shew who \[are\] his, and \[who is\] holy; and will cause \[him\] to come near unto him: even \[him\] whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him.

5: 

[[Num.16.6|6]] This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;

6: 

[[Num.16.7|7]] And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow: and it shall be \[that\] the man whom the LORD doth choose, he \[shall be\] holy: \[ye take\] too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.

7: 

[[Num.16.8|8]] And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:

8: 

[[Num.16.9|9]] \[Seemeth it but\] a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them?

9: 

[[Num.16.10|10]] And he hath brought thee near \[to him\], and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?

10: 

[[Num.16.11|11]] For which cause \[both\] thou and all thy company \[are\] gathered together against the LORD: and what \[is\] Aaron, that ye murmur against him?

11: 

[[Num.16.12|12]] And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:

12: 

[[Num.16.13|13]] \[Is it\] a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?

13: 

[[Num.16.14|14]] Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.

14: 

[[Num.16.15|15]] And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.

15: 

[[Num.16.16|16]] And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:

16: 

[[Num.16.17|17]] And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each \[of you\] his censer.

17: 

[[Num.16.18|18]] And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.

18: 

[[Num.16.19|19]] And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.

19: 

[[Num.16.20|20]] And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

20: 

[[Num.16.21|21]] Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.

21: 

[[Num.16.22|22]] And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?

22:
