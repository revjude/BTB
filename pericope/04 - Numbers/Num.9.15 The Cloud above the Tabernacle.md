[[Num.9|Numbers 9:15 - Numbers 9:23]]
*The Cloud above the Tabernacle*

[[Num.9.15|15]] And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, \[namely\], the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.

15: 

[[Num.9.16|16]] So it was alway: the cloud covered it \[by day\], and the appearance of fire by night.

16: 

[[Num.9.17|17]] And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.

17: 

[[Num.9.18|18]] At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.

18: 

[[Num.9.19|19]] And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.

19: 

[[Num.9.20|20]] And \[so\] it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.

20: 

[[Num.9.21|21]] And \[so\] it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and \[that\] the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether \[it was\] by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.

21: 

[[Num.9.22|22]] Or \[whether it were\] two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.

22: 

[[Num.9.23|23]] At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

23:
