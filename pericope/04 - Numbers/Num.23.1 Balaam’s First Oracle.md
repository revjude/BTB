[[Num.23|Numbers 23:1 - Numbers 23:12]]
*Balaam’s First Oracle*

[[Num.23.1|1]] And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.

1: 

[[Num.23.2|2]] And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on \[every\] altar a bullock and a ram.

2: 

[[Num.23.3|3]] And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.

3: 

[[Num.23.4|4]] And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon \[every\] altar a bullock and a ram.

4: 

[[Num.23.5|5]] And the LORD put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.

5: 

[[Num.23.6|6]] And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.

6: 

[[Num.23.7|7]] And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, \[saying\], Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.

7: 

[[Num.23.8|8]] How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, \[whom\] the LORD hath not defied?

8: 

[[Num.23.9|9]] For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.

9: 

[[Num.23.10|10]] Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth \[part\] of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!

10: 

[[Num.23.11|11]] And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed \[them\] altogether.

11: 

[[Num.23.12|12]] And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth?

12:
