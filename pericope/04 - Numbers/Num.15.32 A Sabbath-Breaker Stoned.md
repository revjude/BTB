[[Num.15|Numbers 15:32 - Numbers 15:36]]
*A Sabbath-Breaker Stoned*

[[Num.15.32|32]] And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.

32: 

[[Num.15.33|33]] And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.

33: 

[[Num.15.34|34]] And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.

34: 

[[Num.15.35|35]] And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.

35: 

[[Num.15.36|36]] And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.

36:
