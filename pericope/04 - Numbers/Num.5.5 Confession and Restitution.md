[[Num.5|Numbers 5:5 - Numbers 5:10]]
*Confession and Restitution*

[[Num.5.5|5]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

5: 

[[Num.5.6|6]] Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person be guilty;

6: 

[[Num.5.7|7]] Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it the fifth \[part\] thereof, and give \[it\] unto \[him\] against whom he hath trespassed.

7: 

[[Num.5.8|8]] But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, \[even\] to the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him.

8: 

[[Num.5.9|9]] And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.

9: 

[[Num.5.10|10]] And every man’s hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his.

10:
