[[Num.14|Numbers 14:1 - Numbers 14:12]]
*Israel’s Rebellion*

[[Num.14.1|1]] And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.

1: 

[[Num.14.2|2]] And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!

2: 

[[Num.14.3|3]] And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?

3: 

[[Num.14.4|4]] And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.

4: 

[[Num.14.5|5]] Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.

5: 

[[Num.14.6|6]] And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, \[which were\] of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:

6: 

[[Num.14.7|7]] And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, \[is\] an exceeding good land.

7: 

[[Num.14.8|8]] If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.

8: 

[[Num.14.9|9]] Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they \[are\] bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD \[is\] with us: fear them not.

9: 

[[Num.14.10|10]] But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.

10: 

[[Num.14.11|11]] And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them?

11: 

[[Num.14.12|12]] I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.

12:
