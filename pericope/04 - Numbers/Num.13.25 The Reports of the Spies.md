[[Num.13|Numbers 13:25 - Numbers 13:33]]
*The Reports of the Spies*

[[Num.13.25|25]] And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.

25: 

[[Num.13.26|26]] And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.

26: 

[[Num.13.27|27]] And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this \[is\] the fruit of it.

27: 

[[Num.13.28|28]] Nevertheless the people \[be\] strong that dwell in the land, and the cities \[are\] walled, \[and\] very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.

28: 

[[Num.13.29|29]] The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.

29: 

[[Num.13.30|30]] And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.

30: 

[[Num.13.31|31]] But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they \[are\] stronger than we.

31: 

[[Num.13.32|32]] And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, \[is\] a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it \[are\] men of a great stature.

32: 

[[Num.13.33|33]] And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, \[which come\] of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.

33:
