[[Num.35|Numbers 35:1 - Numbers 35:8]]
*Forty-Eight Cities for the Levites*

[[Num.35.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan \[near\] Jericho, saying,

1: 

[[Num.35.2|2]] Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give \[also\] unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them.

2: 

[[Num.35.3|3]] And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.

3: 

[[Num.35.4|4]] And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, \[shall reach\] from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.

4: 

[[Num.35.5|5]] And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city \[shall be\] in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.

5: 

[[Num.35.6|6]] And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites \[there shall be\] six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities.

6: 

[[Num.35.7|7]] \[So\] all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites \[shall be\] forty and eight cities: them \[shall ye give\] with their suburbs.

7: 

[[Num.35.8|8]] And the cities which ye shall give \[shall be\] of the possession of the children of Israel: from \[them that have\] many ye shall give many; but from \[them that have\] few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.

8:
