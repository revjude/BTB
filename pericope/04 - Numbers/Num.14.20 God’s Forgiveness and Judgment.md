[[Num.14|Numbers 14:20 - Numbers 14:35]]
*God’s Forgiveness and Judgment*

[[Num.14.20|20]] And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:

20: 

[[Num.14.21|21]] But \[as\] truly \[as\] I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.

21: 

[[Num.14.22|22]] Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;

22: 

[[Num.14.23|23]] Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:

23: 

[[Num.14.24|24]] But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.

24: 

[[Num.14.25|25]] (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To morrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.

25: 

[[Num.14.26|26]] And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

26: 

[[Num.14.27|27]] How long \[shall I bear with\] this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.

27: 

[[Num.14.28|28]] Say unto them, \[As truly as\] I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:

28: 

[[Num.14.29|29]] Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me,

29: 

[[Num.14.30|30]] Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, \[concerning\] which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

30: 

[[Num.14.31|31]] But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.

31: 

[[Num.14.32|32]] But \[as for\] you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness.

32: 

[[Num.14.33|33]] And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness.

33: 

[[Num.14.34|34]] After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, \[even\] forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, \[even\] forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.

34: 

[[Num.14.35|35]] I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.

35:
