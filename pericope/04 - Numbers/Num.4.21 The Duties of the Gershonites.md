[[Num.4|Numbers 4:21 - Numbers 4:28]]
*The Duties of the Gershonites*

[[Num.4.21|21]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

21: 

[[Num.4.22|22]] Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses of their fathers, by their families;

22: 

[[Num.4.23|23]] From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.

23: 

[[Num.4.24|24]] This \[is\] the service of the families of the Gershonites, to serve, and for burdens:

24: 

[[Num.4.25|25]] And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the badgers’ skins that \[is\] above upon it, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,

25: 

[[Num.4.26|26]] And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the gate of the court, which \[is\] by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and all that is made for them: so shall they serve.

26: 

[[Num.4.27|27]] At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all their service: and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens.

27: 

[[Num.4.28|28]] This \[is\] the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge \[shall be\] under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

28:
