[[Num.17|Numbers 17:1 - Numbers 17:13]]
*Aaron’s Staff Buds*

[[Num.17.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

1: 

[[Num.17.2|2]] Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of \[their\] fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man’s name upon his rod.

2: 

[[Num.17.3|3]] And thou shalt write Aaron’s name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod \[shall be\] for the head of the house of their fathers.

3: 

[[Num.17.4|4]] And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.

4: 

[[Num.17.5|5]] And it shall come to pass, \[that\] the man’s rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.

5: 

[[Num.17.6|6]] And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers’ houses, \[even\] twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron \[was\] among their rods.

6: 

[[Num.17.7|7]] And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.

7: 

[[Num.17.8|8]] And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.

8: 

[[Num.17.9|9]] And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.

9: 

[[Num.17.10|10]] And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron’s rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.

10: 

[[Num.17.11|11]] And Moses did \[so\]: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.

11: 

[[Num.17.12|12]] And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.

12: 

[[Num.17.13|13]] Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?

13:
