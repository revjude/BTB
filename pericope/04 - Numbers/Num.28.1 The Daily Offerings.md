[[Num.28|Numbers 28:1 - Numbers 28:8]]
*The Daily Offerings*

[[Num.28.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

1: 

[[Num.28.2|2]] Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, \[and\] my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, \[for\] a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.

2: 

[[Num.28.3|3]] And thou shalt say unto them, This \[is\] the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, \[for\] a continual burnt offering.

3: 

[[Num.28.4|4]] The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;

4: 

[[Num.28.5|5]] And a tenth \[part\] of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled with the fourth \[part\] of an hin of beaten oil.

5: 

[[Num.28.6|6]] \[It is\] a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

6: 

[[Num.28.7|7]] And the drink offering thereof \[shall be\] the fourth \[part\] of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy \[place\] shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the LORD \[for\] a drink offering.

7: 

[[Num.28.8|8]] And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer \[it\], a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

8:
