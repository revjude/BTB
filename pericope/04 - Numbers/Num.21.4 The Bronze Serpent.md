[[Num.21|Numbers 21:4 - Numbers 21:9]]
*The Bronze Serpent*

[[Num.21.4|4]] And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.

4: 

[[Num.21.5|5]] And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for \[there is\] no bread, neither \[is there any\] water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.

5: 

[[Num.21.6|6]] And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.

6: 

[[Num.21.7|7]] Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.

7: 

[[Num.21.8|8]] And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.

8: 

[[Num.21.9|9]] And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.

9:
