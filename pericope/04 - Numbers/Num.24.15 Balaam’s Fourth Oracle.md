[[Num.24|Numbers 24:15 - Numbers 24:19]]
*Balaam’s Fourth Oracle*

[[Num.24.15|15]] And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:

15: 

[[Num.24.16|16]] He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, \[which\] saw the vision of the Almighty, falling \[into a trance\], but having his eyes open:

16: 

[[Num.24.17|17]] I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.

17: 

[[Num.24.18|18]] And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.

18: 

[[Num.24.19|19]] Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.

19:
