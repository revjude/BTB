[[Num.11|Numbers 11:31 - Numbers 11:35]]
*The Quail and the Plague*

[[Num.11.31|31]] And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let \[them\] fall by the camp, as it were a day’s journey on this side, and as it were a day’s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits \[high\] upon the face of the earth.

31: 

[[Num.11.32|32]] And the people stood up all that day, and all \[that\] night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread \[them\] all abroad for themselves round about the camp.

32: 

[[Num.11.33|33]] And while the flesh \[was\] yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.

33: 

[[Num.11.34|34]] And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.

34: 

[[Num.11.35|35]] \[And\] the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth.

35:
