[[Num.14|Numbers 14:40 - Numbers 14:45]]
*The Defeat at Hormah*

[[Num.14.40|40]] And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we \[be here\], and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.

40: 

[[Num.14.41|41]] And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.

41: 

[[Num.14.42|42]] Go not up, for the LORD \[is\] not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.

42: 

[[Num.14.43|43]] For the Amalekites and the Canaanites \[are\] there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.

43: 

[[Num.14.44|44]] But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.

44: 

[[Num.14.45|45]] Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, \[even\] unto Hormah.

45:
