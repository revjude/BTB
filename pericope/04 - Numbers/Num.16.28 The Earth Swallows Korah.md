[[Num.16|Numbers 16:28 - Numbers 16:35]]
*The Earth Swallows Korah*

[[Num.16.28|28]] And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for \[I have\] not \[done them\] of mine own mind.

28: 

[[Num.16.29|29]] If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; \[then\] the LORD hath not sent me.

29: 

[[Num.16.30|30]] But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that \[appertain\] unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.

30: 

[[Num.16.31|31]] And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that \[was\] under them:

31: 

[[Num.16.32|32]] And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that \[appertained\] unto Korah, and all \[their\] goods.

32: 

[[Num.16.33|33]] They, and all that \[appertained\] to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.

33: 

[[Num.16.34|34]] And all Israel that \[were\] round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up \[also\].

34: 

[[Num.16.35|35]] And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.

35:
