[[Num.5|Numbers 5:1 - Numbers 5:4]]
*Cleansing the Camps*

[[Num.5.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

1: 

[[Num.5.2|2]] Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead:

2: 

[[Num.5.3|3]] Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.

3: 

[[Num.5.4|4]] And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.

4:
