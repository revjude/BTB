[[Num.31|Numbers 31:25 - Numbers 31:47]]
*Division of the Spoils*

[[Num.31.25|25]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

25: 

[[Num.31.26|26]] Take the sum of the prey that was taken, \[both\] of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation:

26: 

[[Num.31.27|27]] And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:

27: 

[[Num.31.28|28]] And levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, \[both\] of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:

28: 

[[Num.31.29|29]] Take \[it\] of their half, and give \[it\] unto Eleazar the priest, \[for\] an heave offering of the LORD.

29: 

[[Num.31.30|30]] And of the children of Israel’s half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.

30: 

[[Num.31.31|31]] And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.

31: 

[[Num.31.32|32]] And the booty, \[being\] the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,

32: 

[[Num.31.33|33]] And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,

33: 

[[Num.31.34|34]] And threescore and one thousand asses,

34: 

[[Num.31.35|35]] And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him.

35: 

[[Num.31.36|36]] And the half, \[which was\] the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep:

36: 

[[Num.31.37|37]] And the LORD’S tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.

37: 

[[Num.31.38|38]] And the beeves \[were\] thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD’S tribute \[was\] threescore and twelve.

38: 

[[Num.31.39|39]] And the asses \[were\] thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD’S tribute \[was\] threescore and one.

39: 

[[Num.31.40|40]] And the persons \[were\] sixteen thousand; of which the LORD’S tribute \[was\] thirty and two persons.

40: 

[[Num.31.41|41]] And Moses gave the tribute, \[which was\] the LORD’S heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.

41: 

[[Num.31.42|42]] And of the children of Israel’s half, which Moses divided from the men that warred,

42: 

[[Num.31.43|43]] (Now the half \[that pertained unto\] the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand \[and\] seven thousand and five hundred sheep,

43: 

[[Num.31.44|44]] And thirty and six thousand beeves,

44: 

[[Num.31.45|45]] And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,

45: 

[[Num.31.46|46]] And sixteen thousand persons;)

46: 

[[Num.31.47|47]] Even of the children of Israel’s half, Moses took one portion of fifty, \[both\] of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
