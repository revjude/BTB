[[Num.20|Numbers 20:22 - Numbers 20:29]]
*The Death of Aaron*

[[Num.20.22|22]] And the children of Israel, \[even\] the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.

22: 

[[Num.20.23|23]] And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying,

23: 

[[Num.20.24|24]] Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.

24: 

[[Num.20.25|25]] Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor:

25: 

[[Num.20.26|26]] And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered \[unto his people\], and shall die there.

26: 

[[Num.20.27|27]] And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.

27: 

[[Num.20.28|28]] And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.

28: 

[[Num.20.29|29]] And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, \[even\] all the house of Israel.

29:
