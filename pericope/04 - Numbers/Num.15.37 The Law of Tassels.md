[[Num.15|Numbers 15:37 - Numbers 15:41]]
*The Law of Tassels*

[[Num.15.37|37]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

37: 

[[Num.15.38|38]] Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue:

38: 

[[Num.15.39|39]] And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:

39: 

[[Num.15.40|40]] That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.

40: 

[[Num.15.41|41]] I \[am\] the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I \[am\] the LORD your God.

41:
