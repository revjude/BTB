[[Num.18|Numbers 18:1 - Numbers 18:7]]
*Duties of Priests and Levites*

[[Num.18.1|1]] And the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father’s house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.

1: 

[[Num.18.2|2]] And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee \[shall minister\] before the tabernacle of witness.

2: 

[[Num.18.3|3]] And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.

3: 

[[Num.18.4|4]] And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.

4: 

[[Num.18.5|5]] And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.

5: 

[[Num.18.6|6]] And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you \[they are\] given \[as\] a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.

6: 

[[Num.18.7|7]] Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest’s office for every thing of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall serve: I have given your priest’s office \[unto you as\] a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

7:
