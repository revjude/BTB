[[Num.26|Numbers 26:52 - Numbers 26:56]]
*Inheritance by Lot*

[[Num.26.52|52]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

52: 

[[Num.26.53|53]] Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names.

53: 

[[Num.26.54|54]] To many thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to few thou shalt give the less inheritance: to every one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him.

54: 

[[Num.26.55|55]] Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot: according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.

55: 

[[Num.26.56|56]] According to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided between many and few.

56:
