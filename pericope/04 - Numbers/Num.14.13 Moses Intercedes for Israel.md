[[Num.14|Numbers 14:13 - Numbers 14:19]]
*Moses Intercedes for Israel*

[[Num.14.13|13]] And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear \[it\], (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)

13: 

[[Num.14.14|14]] And they will tell \[it\] to the inhabitants of this land: \[for\] they have heard that thou LORD \[art\] among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and \[that\] thy cloud standeth over them, and \[that\] thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.

14: 

[[Num.14.15|15]] Now \[if\] thou shalt kill \[all\] this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,

15: 

[[Num.14.16|16]] Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.

16: 

[[Num.14.17|17]] And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,

17: 

[[Num.14.18|18]] The LORD \[is\] longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing \[the guilty\], visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth \[generation\].

18: 

[[Num.14.19|19]] Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.

19:
