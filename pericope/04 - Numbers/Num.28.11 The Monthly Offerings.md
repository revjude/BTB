11: 

[[Num.28.12|12]] And three tenth deals of flour \[for\] a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour \[for\] a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram;

12: 

[[Num.28.13|13]] And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil \[for\] a meat offering unto one lamb; \[for\] a burnt offering of a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

13: 

[[Num.28.14|14]] And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock, and the third \[part\] of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth \[part\] of an hin unto a lamb: this \[is\] the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year.
