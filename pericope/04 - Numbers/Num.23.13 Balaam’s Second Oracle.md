[[Num.23|Numbers 23:13 - Numbers 23:30]]
*Balaam’s Second Oracle*

[[Num.23.13|13]] And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.

13: 

[[Num.23.14|14]] And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on \[every\] altar.

14: 

[[Num.23.15|15]] And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet \[the LORD\] yonder.

15: 

[[Num.23.16|16]] And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.

16: 

[[Num.23.17|17]] And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?

17: 

[[Num.23.18|18]] And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:

18: 

[[Num.23.19|19]] God \[is\] not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do \[it\]? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?

19: 

[[Num.23.20|20]] Behold, I have received \[commandment\] to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.

20: 

[[Num.23.21|21]] He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God \[is\] with him, and the shout of a king \[is\] among them.

21: 

[[Num.23.22|22]] God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.

22: 

[[Num.23.23|23]] Surely \[there is\] no enchantment against Jacob, neither \[is there\] any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!

23: 

[[Num.23.24|24]] Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat \[of\] the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.

24: 

[[Num.23.25|25]] And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.

25: 

[[Num.23.26|26]] But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?

26: 

[[Num.23.27|27]] And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.

27: 

[[Num.23.28|28]] And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon.

28: 

[[Num.23.29|29]] And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.

29: 

[[Num.23.30|30]] And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on \[every\] altar.

30:
