[[Num.21|Numbers 21:10 - Numbers 21:20]]
*The Journey to Moab*

[[Num.21.10|10]] And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.

10: 

[[Num.21.11|11]] And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which \[is\] before Moab, toward the sunrising.

11: 

[[Num.21.12|12]] From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.

12: 

[[Num.21.13|13]] From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which \[is\] in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon \[is\] the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.

13: 

[[Num.21.14|14]] Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,

14: 

[[Num.21.15|15]] And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.

15: 

[[Num.21.16|16]] And from thence \[they went\] to Beer: that \[is\] the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.

16: 

[[Num.21.17|17]] Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:

17: 

[[Num.21.18|18]] The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by \[the direction of\] the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness \[they went\] to Mattanah:

18: 

[[Num.21.19|19]] And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:

19: 

[[Num.21.20|20]] And from Bamoth \[in\] the valley, that \[is\] in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.

20:
