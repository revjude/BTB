[[Num.20|Numbers 20:14 - Numbers 20:21]]
*Edom Refuses Passage*

[[Num.20.14|14]] And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:

14: 

[[Num.20.15|15]] How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:

15: 

[[Num.20.16|16]] And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we \[are\] in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:

16: 

[[Num.20.17|17]] Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink \[of\] the water of the wells: we will go by the king’s \[high\] way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.

17: 

[[Num.20.18|18]] And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.

18: 

[[Num.20.19|19]] And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without \[doing\] any thing \[else\], go through on my feet.

19: 

[[Num.20.20|20]] And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.

20: 

[[Num.20.21|21]] Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.

21:
