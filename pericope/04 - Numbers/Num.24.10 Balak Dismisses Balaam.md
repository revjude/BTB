[[Num.24|Numbers 24:10 - Numbers 24:14]]
*Balak Dismisses Balaam*

[[Num.24.10|10]] And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed \[them\] these three times.

10: 

[[Num.24.11|11]] Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.

11: 

[[Num.24.12|12]] And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,

12: 

[[Num.24.13|13]] If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do \[either\] good or bad of mine own mind; \[but\] what the LORD saith, that will I speak?

13: 

[[Num.24.14|14]] And now, behold, I go unto my people: come \[therefore, and\] I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.

14:
