*The Voluntary Offering*

[[Num.31.48|48]] And the officers which \[were\] over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:

48: 

[[Num.31.49|49]] And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which \[are\] under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.

49: 

[[Num.31.50|50]] We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.

50: 

[[Num.31.51|51]] And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, \[even\] all wrought jewels.

51: 

[[Num.31.52|52]] And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.

52: 

[[Num.31.53|53]] (\[For\] the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)

53: 

[[Num.31.54|54]] And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, \[for\] a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.

54:
