[[Num.15|Numbers 15:22 - Numbers 15:31]]
*Offerings for Unintentional Sins*

[[Num.15.22|22]] And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,

22: 

[[Num.15.23|23]] \[Even\] all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded \[Moses\], and henceforward among your generations;

23: 

[[Num.15.24|24]] Then it shall be, if \[ought\] be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.

24: 

[[Num.15.25|25]] And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it \[is\] ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:

25: 

[[Num.15.26|26]] And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people \[were\] in ignorance.

26: 

[[Num.15.27|27]] And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering.

27: 

[[Num.15.28|28]] And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.

28: 

[[Num.15.29|29]] Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, \[both for\] him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.

29: 

[[Num.15.30|30]] But the soul that doeth \[ought\] presumptuously, \[whether he be\] born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

30: 

[[Num.15.31|31]] Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity \[shall be\] upon him.

31:
