[[Num.16|Numbers 16:36 - Numbers 16:40]]
*The Censers Reserved for Holy Use*

[[Num.16.36|36]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

36: 

[[Num.16.37|37]] Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.

37: 

[[Num.16.38|38]] The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates \[for\] a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.

38: 

[[Num.16.39|39]] And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad \[plates for\] a covering of the altar:

39: 

[[Num.16.40|40]] \[To be\] a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which \[is\] not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.

40:
