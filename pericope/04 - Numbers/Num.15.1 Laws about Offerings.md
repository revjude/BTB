[[Num.15|Numbers 15:1 - Numbers 15:21]]
*Laws about Offerings*

[[Num.15.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

1: 

[[Num.15.2|2]] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,

2: 

[[Num.15.3|3]] And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd, or of the flock:

3: 

[[Num.15.4|4]] Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth \[part\] of an hin of oil.

4: 

[[Num.15.5|5]] And the fourth \[part\] of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.

5: 

[[Num.15.6|6]] Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare \[for\] a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third \[part\] of an hin of oil.

6: 

[[Num.15.7|7]] And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third \[part\] of an hin of wine, \[for\] a sweet savour unto the LORD.

7: 

[[Num.15.8|8]] And when thou preparest a bullock \[for\] a burnt offering, or \[for\] a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD:

8: 

[[Num.15.9|9]] Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.

9: 

[[Num.15.10|10]] And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, \[for\] an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

10: 

[[Num.15.11|11]] Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid.

11: 

[[Num.15.12|12]] According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.

12: 

[[Num.15.13|13]] All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

13: 

[[Num.15.14|14]] And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever \[be\] among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.

14: 

[[Num.15.15|15]] One ordinance \[shall be both\] for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth \[with you\], an ordinance for ever in your generations: as ye \[are\], so shall the stranger be before the LORD.

15: 

[[Num.15.16|16]] One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.

16: 

[[Num.15.17|17]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

17: 

[[Num.15.18|18]] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,

18: 

[[Num.15.19|19]] Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.

19: 

[[Num.15.20|20]] Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough \[for\] an heave offering: as \[ye do\] the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it.

20: 

[[Num.15.21|21]] Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering in your generations.

21:
