[[Num.3|Numbers 3:40 - Numbers 3:51]]
*The Redemption of the Firstborn*

[[Num.3.40|40]] And the LORD said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.

40: 

[[Num.3.41|41]] And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I \[am\] the LORD) instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel.

41: 

[[Num.3.42|42]] And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of Israel.

42: 

[[Num.3.43|43]] And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen.

43: 

[[Num.3.44|44]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

44: 

[[Num.3.45|45]] Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I \[am\] the LORD.

45: 

[[Num.3.46|46]] And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel, which are more than the Levites;

46: 

[[Num.3.47|47]] Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take \[them\]: (the shekel \[is\] twenty gerahs:)

47: 

[[Num.3.48|48]] And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons.

48: 

[[Num.3.49|49]] And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites:

49: 

[[Num.3.50|50]] Of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money; a thousand three hundred and threescore and five \[shekels\], after the shekel of the sanctuary:

50: 

[[Num.3.51|51]] And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.

51:
