[[Num.1|Numbers 1:47 - Numbers 1:54]]
*The Exemption of the Levites*

[[Num.1.47|47]] But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.

47: 

[[Num.1.48|48]] For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying,

48: 

[[Num.1.49|49]] Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel:

49: 

[[Num.1.50|50]] But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that \[belong\] to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.

50: 

[[Num.1.51|51]] And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

51: 

[[Num.1.52|52]] And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.

52: 

[[Num.1.53|53]] But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.

53: 

[[Num.1.54|54]] And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.

54:
