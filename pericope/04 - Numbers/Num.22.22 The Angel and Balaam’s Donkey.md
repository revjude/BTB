[[Num.22|Numbers 22:22 - Numbers 22:41]]
*The Angel and Balaam’s Donkey*

[[Num.22.22|22]] And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants \[were\] with him.

22: 

[[Num.22.23|23]] And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.

23: 

[[Num.22.24|24]] But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall \[being\] on this side, and a wall on that side.

24: 

[[Num.22.25|25]] And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he smote her again.

25: 

[[Num.22.26|26]] And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where \[was\] no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.

26: 

[[Num.22.27|27]] And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.

27: 

[[Num.22.28|28]] And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?

28: 

[[Num.22.29|29]] And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.

29: 

[[Num.22.30|30]] And the ass said unto Balaam, \[Am\] not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since \[I was\] thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.

30: 

[[Num.22.31|31]] Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.

31: 

[[Num.22.32|32]] And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because \[thy\] way is perverse before me:

32: 

[[Num.22.33|33]] And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.

33: 

[[Num.22.34|34]] And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.

34: 

[[Num.22.35|35]] And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.

35: 

[[Num.22.36|36]] And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which \[is\] in the border of Arnon, which \[is\] in the utmost coast.

36: 

[[Num.22.37|37]] And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?

37: 

[[Num.22.38|38]] And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.

38: 

[[Num.22.39|39]] And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.

39: 

[[Num.22.40|40]] And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that \[were\] with him.

40: 

[[Num.22.41|41]] And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost \[part\] of the people.
