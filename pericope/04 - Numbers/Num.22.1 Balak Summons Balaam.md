[[Num.22|Numbers 22:1 - Numbers 22:21]]
*Balak Summons Balaam*

[[Num.22.1|1]] And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan \[by\] Jericho.

1: 

[[Num.22.2|2]] And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.

2: 

[[Num.22.3|3]] And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they \[were\] many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.

3: 

[[Num.22.4|4]] And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all \[that are\] round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor \[was\] king of the Moabites at that time.

4: 

[[Num.22.5|5]] He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which \[is\] by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:

5: 

[[Num.22.6|6]] Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they \[are\] too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, \[that\] we may smite them, and \[that\] I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest \[is\] blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.

6: 

[[Num.22.7|7]] And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.

7: 

[[Num.22.8|8]] And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.

8: 

[[Num.22.9|9]] And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men \[are\] these with thee?

9: 

[[Num.22.10|10]] And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, \[saying\],

10: 

[[Num.22.11|11]] Behold, \[there is\] a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.

11: 

[[Num.22.12|12]] And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they \[are\] blessed.

12: 

[[Num.22.13|13]] And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.

13: 

[[Num.22.14|14]] And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.

14: 

[[Num.22.15|15]] And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.

15: 

[[Num.22.16|16]] And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:

16: 

[[Num.22.17|17]] For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.

17: 

[[Num.22.18|18]] And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.

18: 

[[Num.22.19|19]] Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.

19: 

[[Num.22.20|20]] And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, \[and\] go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.

20: 

[[Num.22.21|21]] And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.

21:
