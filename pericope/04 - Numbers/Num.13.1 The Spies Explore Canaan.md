[[Num.13|Numbers 13:1 - Numbers 13:24]]
*The Spies Explore Canaan*

[[Num.13.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

1: 

[[Num.13.2|2]] Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.

2: 

[[Num.13.3|3]] And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men \[were\] heads of the children of Israel.

3: 

[[Num.13.4|4]] And these \[were\] their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.

4: 

[[Num.13.5|5]] Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.

5: 

[[Num.13.6|6]] Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

6: 

[[Num.13.7|7]] Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.

7: 

[[Num.13.8|8]] Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.

8: 

[[Num.13.9|9]] Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.

9: 

[[Num.13.10|10]] Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.

10: 

[[Num.13.11|11]] Of the tribe of Joseph, \[namely\], of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.

11: 

[[Num.13.12|12]] Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.

12: 

[[Num.13.13|13]] Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.

13: 

[[Num.13.14|14]] Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.

14: 

[[Num.13.15|15]] Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.

15: 

[[Num.13.16|16]] These \[are\] the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.

16: 

[[Num.13.17|17]] And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this \[way\] southward, and go up into the mountain:

17: 

[[Num.13.18|18]] And see the land, what it \[is\]; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they \[be\] strong or weak, few or many;

18: 

[[Num.13.19|19]] And what the land \[is\] that they dwell in, whether it \[be\] good or bad; and what cities \[they be\] that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;

19: 

[[Num.13.20|20]] And what the land \[is\], whether it \[be\] fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time \[was\] the time of the firstripe grapes.

20: 

[[Num.13.21|21]] So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.

21: 

[[Num.13.22|22]] And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, \[were\]. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)

22: 

[[Num.13.23|23]] And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and \[they brought\] of the pomegranates, and of the figs.

23: 

[[Num.13.24|24]] The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.
