12: 

[[Num.10.13|13]] And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

13: 

[[Num.10.14|14]] In the first \[place\] went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host \[was\] Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

14: 

[[Num.10.15|15]] And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar \[was\] Nethaneel the son of Zuar.

15: 

[[Num.10.16|16]] And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun \[was\] Eliab the son of Helon.

16: 

[[Num.10.17|17]] And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.

17: 

[[Num.10.18|18]] And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies: and over his host \[was\] Elizur the son of Shedeur.

18:

21: 

[[Num.10.22|22]] And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies: and over his host \[was\] Elishama the son of Ammihud.

22:

24:

29: 

[[Num.10.30|30]] And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.

30: 

[[Num.10.31|31]] And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.

31: 

[[Num.10.32|32]] And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.

32: 

[[Num.10.33|33]] And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days’ journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days’ journey, to search out a resting place for them.

33: 

[[Num.10.34|34]] And the cloud of the LORD \[was\] upon them by day, when they went out of the camp.

34: 

[[Num.10.35|35]] And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.

35: 

[[Num.10.36|36]] And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands of Israel.
