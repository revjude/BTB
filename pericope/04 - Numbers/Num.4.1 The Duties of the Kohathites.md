[[Num.4|Numbers 4:1 - Numbers 4:20]]
*The Duties of the Kohathites*

[[Num.4.1|1]] And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

1: 

[[Num.4.2|2]] Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, after their families, by the house of their fathers,

2: 

[[Num.4.3|3]] From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.

3: 

[[Num.4.4|4]] This \[shall be\] the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation, \[about\] the most holy things:

4: 

[[Num.4.5|5]] And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his sons, and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover the ark of testimony with it:

5: 

[[Num.4.6|6]] And shall put thereon the covering of badgers’ skins, and shall spread over \[it\] a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in the staves thereof.

6: 

[[Num.4.7|7]] And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers to cover withal: and the continual bread shall be thereon:

7: 

[[Num.4.8|8]] And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the same with a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put in the staves thereof.

8: 

[[Num.4.9|9]] And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it:

9: 

[[Num.4.10|10]] And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put \[it\] upon a bar.

10: 

[[Num.4.11|11]] And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and cover it with a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put to the staves thereof:

11: 

[[Num.4.12|12]] And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, and put \[them\] in a cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put \[them\] on a bar:

12: 

[[Num.4.13|13]] And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon:

13: 

[[Num.4.14|14]] And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they minister about it, \[even\] the censers, the fleshhooks, and the shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers’ skins, and put to the staves of it.

14: 

[[Num.4.15|15]] And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear \[it\]: but they shall not touch \[any\] holy thing, lest they die. These \[things are\] the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation.

15: 

[[Num.4.16|16]] And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest \[pertaineth\] the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, \[and\] the oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein \[is\], in the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof.

16: 

[[Num.4.17|17]] And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

17: 

[[Num.4.18|18]] Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites:

18: 

[[Num.4.19|19]] But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden:

19: 

[[Num.4.20|20]] But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered, lest they die.

20:
