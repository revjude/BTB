[[Hos.13|Hosea 13:1 - Hosea 13:8]]
*God’s Anger against Israel*

[[Hos.13.1|1]] When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.

1: 

[[Hos.13.2|2]] And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, \[and\] idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.

2: 

[[Hos.13.3|3]] Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff \[that\] is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.

3: 

[[Hos.13.4|4]] Yet I \[am\] the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for \[there is\] no saviour beside me.

4: 

[[Hos.13.5|5]] I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.

5: 

[[Hos.13.6|6]] According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me.

6: 

[[Hos.13.7|7]] Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe \[them\]:

7: 

[[Hos.13.8|8]] I will meet them as a bear \[that is\] bereaved \[of her whelps\], and will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.

8:
