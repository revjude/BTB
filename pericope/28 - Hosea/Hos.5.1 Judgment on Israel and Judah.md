[[Hos.5|Hosea 5:1 - Hosea 5:15]]
*Judgment on Israel and Judah*

[[Hos.5.1|1]] Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment \[is\] toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.

1: 

[[Hos.5.2|2]] And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I \[have been\] a rebuker of them all.

2: 

[[Hos.5.3|3]] I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, \[and\] Israel is defiled.

3: 

[[Hos.5.4|4]] They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms \[is\] in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.

4: 

[[Hos.5.5|5]] And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.

5: 

[[Hos.5.6|6]] They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find \[him\]; he hath withdrawn himself from them.

6: 

[[Hos.5.7|7]] They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.

7: 

[[Hos.5.8|8]] Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, \[and\] the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud \[at\] Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.

8: 

[[Hos.5.9|9]] Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.

9: 

[[Hos.5.10|10]] The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: \[therefore\] I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.

10: 

[[Hos.5.11|11]] Ephraim \[is\] oppressed \[and\] broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.

11: 

[[Hos.5.12|12]] Therefore \[will\] I \[be\] unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.

12: 

[[Hos.5.13|13]] When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah \[saw\] his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.

13: 

[[Hos.5.14|14]] For I \[will be\] unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, \[even\] I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue \[him\].

14: 

[[Hos.5.15|15]] I will go \[and\] return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.

15:
