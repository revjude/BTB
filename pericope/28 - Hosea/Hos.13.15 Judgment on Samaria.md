[[Hos.13|Hosea 13:15 - Hosea 13:16]]
*Judgment on Samaria*

[[Hos.13.15|15]] Though he be fruitful among \[his\] brethren, an east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.

15: 

[[Hos.13.16|16]] Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.

16:
