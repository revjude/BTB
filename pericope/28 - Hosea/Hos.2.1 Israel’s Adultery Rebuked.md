[[Hos.2|Hosea 2:1 - Hosea 2:13]]
*Israel’s Adultery Rebuked*

[[Hos.2.1|1]] Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.

1: 

[[Hos.2.2|2]] Plead with your mother, plead: for she \[is\] not my wife, neither \[am\] I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;

2: 

[[Hos.2.3|3]] Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.

3: 

[[Hos.2.4|4]] And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they \[be\] the children of whoredoms.

4: 

[[Hos.2.5|5]] For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give \[me\] my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.

5: 

[[Hos.2.6|6]] Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.

6: 

[[Hos.2.7|7]] And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find \[them\]: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then \[was it\] better with me than now.

7: 

[[Hos.2.8|8]] For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, \[which\] they prepared for Baal.

8: 

[[Hos.2.9|9]] Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax \[given\] to cover her nakedness.

9: 

[[Hos.2.10|10]] And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.

10: 

[[Hos.2.11|11]] I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.

11: 

[[Hos.2.12|12]] And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These \[are\] my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.

12: 

[[Hos.2.13|13]] And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.

13:
