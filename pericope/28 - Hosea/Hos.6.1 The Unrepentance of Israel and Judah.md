[[Hos.6|Hosea 6:1 - Hosea 6:11]]
*The Unrepentance of Israel and Judah*

[[Hos.6.1|1]] Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.

1: 

[[Hos.6.2|2]] After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.

2: 

[[Hos.6.3|3]] Then shall we know, \[if\] we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter \[and\] former rain unto the earth.

3: 

[[Hos.6.4|4]] O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness \[is\] as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.

4: 

[[Hos.6.5|5]] Therefore have I hewed \[them\] by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments \[are as\] the light \[that\] goeth forth.

5: 

[[Hos.6.6|6]] For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.

6: 

[[Hos.6.7|7]] But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.

7: 

[[Hos.6.8|8]] Gilead \[is\] a city of them that work iniquity, \[and is\] polluted with blood.

8: 

[[Hos.6.9|9]] And as troops of robbers wait for a man, \[so\] the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.

9: 

[[Hos.6.10|10]] I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there \[is\] the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.

10: 

[[Hos.6.11|11]] Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.

11:
