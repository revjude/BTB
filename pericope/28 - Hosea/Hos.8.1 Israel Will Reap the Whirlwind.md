[[Hos.8|Hosea 8:1 - Hosea 8:14]]
*Israel Will Reap the Whirlwind*

[[Hos.8.1|1]] \[Set\] the trumpet to thy mouth. \[He shall come\] as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.

1: 

[[Hos.8.2|2]] Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.

2: 

[[Hos.8.3|3]] Israel hath cast off \[the thing that is\] good: the enemy shall pursue him.

3: 

[[Hos.8.4|4]] They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew \[it\] not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.

4: 

[[Hos.8.5|5]] Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast \[thee\] off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long \[will it be\] ere they attain to innocency?

5: 

[[Hos.8.6|6]] For from Israel \[was\] it also: the workman made it; therefore it \[is\] not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.

6: 

[[Hos.8.7|7]] For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.

7: 

[[Hos.8.8|8]] Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein \[is\] no pleasure.

8: 

[[Hos.8.9|9]] For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.

9: 

[[Hos.8.10|10]] Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.

10: 

[[Hos.8.11|11]] Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.

11: 

[[Hos.8.12|12]] I have written to him the great things of my law, \[but\] they were counted as a strange thing.

12: 

[[Hos.8.13|13]] They sacrifice flesh \[for\] the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat \[it; but\] the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.

13: 

[[Hos.8.14|14]] For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.

14:
