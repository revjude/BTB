[[Hos.11|Hosea 11:1 - Hosea 11:7]]
*Out of Egypt I Called My Son*

[[Hos.11.1|1]] When Israel \[was\] a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.

1: 

[[Hos.11.2|2]] \[As\] they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.

2: 

[[Hos.11.3|3]] I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.

3: 

[[Hos.11.4|4]] I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.

4: 

[[Hos.11.5|5]] He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.

5: 

[[Hos.11.6|6]] And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour \[them\], because of their own counsels.

6: 

[[Hos.11.7|7]] And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt \[him\].

7:
