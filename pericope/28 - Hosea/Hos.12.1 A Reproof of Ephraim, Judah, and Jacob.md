[[Hos.12|Hosea 12:1 - Hosea 12:14]]
*A Reproof of Ephraim, Judah, and Jacob*

[[Hos.12.1|1]] Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.

1: 

[[Hos.12.2|2]] The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.

2: 

[[Hos.12.3|3]] He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God:

3: 

[[Hos.12.4|4]] Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him \[in\] Bethel, and there he spake with us;

4: 

[[Hos.12.5|5]] Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD \[is\] his memorial.

5: 

[[Hos.12.6|6]] Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually.

6: 

[[Hos.12.7|7]] \[He is\] a merchant, the balances of deceit \[are\] in his hand: he loveth to oppress.

7: 

[[Hos.12.8|8]] And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: \[in\] all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that \[were\] sin.

8: 

[[Hos.12.9|9]] And I \[that am\] the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.

9: 

[[Hos.12.10|10]] I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.

10: 

[[Hos.12.11|11]] \[Is there\] iniquity \[in\] Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars \[are\] as heaps in the furrows of the fields.

11: 

[[Hos.12.12|12]] And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept \[sheep\].

12: 

[[Hos.12.13|13]] And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.

13: 

[[Hos.12.14|14]] Ephraim provoked \[him\] to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.

14:
