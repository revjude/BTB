[[Hos.3|Hosea 3:1 - Hosea 3:5]]
*Hosea Redeems His Wife*

[[Hos.3.1|1]] Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of \[her\] friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.

1: 

[[Hos.3.2|2]] So I bought her to me for fifteen \[pieces\] of silver, and \[for\] an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:

2: 

[[Hos.3.3|3]] And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for \[another\] man: so \[will\] I also \[be\] for thee.

3: 

[[Hos.3.4|4]] For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and \[without\] teraphim:

4: 

[[Hos.3.5|5]] Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.

5:
