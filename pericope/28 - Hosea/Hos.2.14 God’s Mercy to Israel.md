[[Hos.2|Hosea 2:14 - Hosea 2:23]]
*God’s Mercy to Israel*

[[Hos.2.14|14]] Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.

14: 

[[Hos.2.15|15]] And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.

15: 

[[Hos.2.16|16]] And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, \[that\] thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.

16: 

[[Hos.2.17|17]] For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.

17: 

[[Hos.2.18|18]] And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and \[with\] the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.

18: 

[[Hos.2.19|19]] And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.

19: 

[[Hos.2.20|20]] I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.

20: 

[[Hos.2.21|21]] And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;

21: 

[[Hos.2.22|22]] And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.

22: 

[[Hos.2.23|23]] And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to \[them which were\] not my people, Thou \[art\] my people; and they shall say, \[Thou art\] my God.

23:
