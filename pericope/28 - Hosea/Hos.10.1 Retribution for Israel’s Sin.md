[[Hos.10|Hosea 10:1 - Hosea 10:15]]
*Retribution for Israel’s Sin*

[[Hos.10.1|1]] Israel \[is\] an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.

1: 

[[Hos.10.2|2]] Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.

2: 

[[Hos.10.3|3]] For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?

3: 

[[Hos.10.4|4]] They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.

4: 

[[Hos.10.5|5]] The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof \[that\] rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.

5: 

[[Hos.10.6|6]] It shall be also carried unto Assyria \[for\] a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.

6: 

[[Hos.10.7|7]] \[As for\] Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.

7: 

[[Hos.10.8|8]] The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.

8: 

[[Hos.10.9|9]] O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.

9: 

[[Hos.10.10|10]] \[It is\] in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.

10: 

[[Hos.10.11|11]] And Ephraim \[is as\] an heifer \[that is\] taught, \[and\] loveth to tread out \[the corn\]; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, \[and\] Jacob shall break his clods.

11: 

[[Hos.10.12|12]] Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for \[it is\] time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.

12: 

[[Hos.10.13|13]] Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.

13: 

[[Hos.10.14|14]] Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon \[her\] children.

14: 

[[Hos.10.15|15]] So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.

15:
