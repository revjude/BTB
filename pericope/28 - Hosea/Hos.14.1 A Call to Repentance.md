[[Hos.14|Hosea 14:1 - Hosea 14:3]]
*A Call to Repentance*

[[Hos.14.1|1]] O Israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.

1: 

[[Hos.14.2|2]] Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive \[us\] graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.

2: 

[[Hos.14.3|3]] Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, \[Ye are\] our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.

3:
