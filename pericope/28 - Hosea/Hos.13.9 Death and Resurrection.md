[[Hos.13|Hosea 13:9 - Hosea 13:14]]
*Death and Resurrection*

[[Hos.13.9|9]] O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me \[is\] thine help.

9: 

[[Hos.13.10|10]] I will be thy king: where \[is any other\] that may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes?

10: 

[[Hos.13.11|11]] I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took \[him\] away in my wrath.

11: 

[[Hos.13.12|12]] The iniquity of Ephraim \[is\] bound up; his sin \[is\] hid.

12: 

[[Hos.13.13|13]] The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he \[is\] an unwise son; for he should not stay long in \[the place of\] the breaking forth of children.

13: 

[[Hos.13.14|14]] I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.

14:
