[[Hos.11|Hosea 11:8 - Hosea 11:12]]
*God’s Love for Israel*

[[Hos.11.8|8]] How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? \[how\] shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? \[how\] shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.

8: 

[[Hos.11.9|9]] I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I \[am\] God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.

9: 

[[Hos.11.10|10]] They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.

10: 

[[Hos.11.11|11]] They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD.

11: 

[[Hos.11.12|12]] Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.

12:
