[[Hos.7|Hosea 7:1 - Hosea 7:16]]
*Ephraim’s Iniquity*

[[Hos.7.1|1]] When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, \[and\] the troop of robbers spoileth without.

1: 

[[Hos.7.2|2]] And they consider not in their hearts \[that\] I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.

2: 

[[Hos.7.3|3]] They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.

3: 

[[Hos.7.4|4]] They \[are\] all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, \[who\] ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.

4: 

[[Hos.7.5|5]] In the day of our king the princes have made \[him\] sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.

5: 

[[Hos.7.6|6]] For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.

6: 

[[Hos.7.7|7]] They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: \[there is\] none among them that calleth unto me.

7: 

[[Hos.7.8|8]] Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.

8: 

[[Hos.7.9|9]] Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth \[it\] not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.

9: 

[[Hos.7.10|10]] And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.

10: 

[[Hos.7.11|11]] Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.

11: 

[[Hos.7.12|12]] When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.

12: 

[[Hos.7.13|13]] Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.

13: 

[[Hos.7.14|14]] And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, \[and\] they rebel against me.

14: 

[[Hos.7.15|15]] Though I have bound \[and\] strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.

15: 

[[Hos.7.16|16]] They return, \[but\] not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this \[shall be\] their derision in the land of Egypt.

16:
