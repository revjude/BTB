[[Hos.14|Hosea 14:4 - Hosea 14:9]]
*A Promise of God’s Blessing*

[[Hos.14.4|4]] I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him.

4: 

[[Hos.14.5|5]] I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.

5: 

[[Hos.14.6|6]] His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.

6: 

[[Hos.14.7|7]] They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive \[as\] the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof \[shall be\] as the wine of Lebanon.

7: 

[[Hos.14.8|8]] Ephraim \[shall say\], What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard \[him\], and observed him: I \[am\] like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found.

8: 

[[Hos.14.9|9]] Who \[is\] wise, and he shall understand these \[things\]? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD \[are\] right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.

9:
