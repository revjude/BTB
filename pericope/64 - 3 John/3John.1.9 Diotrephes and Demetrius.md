[[3John.1|3 John 1:9 - 3 John 1:12]]
*Diotrephes and Demetrius*

[[3John.1.9|9]] I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.

9: 

[[3John.1.10|10]] Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth \[them\] out of the church.

10: 

[[3John.1.11|11]] Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.

11: 

[[3John.1.12|12]] Demetrius hath good report of all \[men\], and of the truth itself: yea, and we \[also\] bear record; and ye know that our record is true.

12:
