[[Job.21|Job 21:1 - Job 21:34]]
*Job：God Will Punish the Wicked*

[[Job.21.1|1]] But Job answered and said,

1: 

[[Job.21.2|2]] Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.

2: 

[[Job.21.3|3]] Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.

3: 

[[Job.21.4|4]] As for me, \[is\] my complaint to man? and if \[it were so\], why should not my spirit be troubled?

4: 

[[Job.21.5|5]] Mark me, and be astonished, and lay \[your\] hand upon \[your\] mouth.

5: 

[[Job.21.6|6]] Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.

6: 

[[Job.21.7|7]] Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?

7: 

[[Job.21.8|8]] Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.

8: 

[[Job.21.9|9]] Their houses \[are\] safe from fear, neither \[is\] the rod of God upon them.

9: 

[[Job.21.10|10]] Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.

10: 

[[Job.21.11|11]] They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.

11: 

[[Job.21.12|12]] They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.

12: 

[[Job.21.13|13]] They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.

13: 

[[Job.21.14|14]] Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.

14: 

[[Job.21.15|15]] What \[is\] the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?

15: 

[[Job.21.16|16]] Lo, their good \[is\] not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.

16: 

[[Job.21.17|17]] How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and \[how oft\] cometh their destruction upon them! \[God\] distributeth sorrows in his anger.

17: 

[[Job.21.18|18]] They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.

18: 

[[Job.21.19|19]] God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know \[it\].

19: 

[[Job.21.20|20]] His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.

20: 

[[Job.21.21|21]] For what pleasure \[hath\] he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?

21: 

[[Job.21.22|22]] Shall \[any\] teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.

22: 

[[Job.21.23|23]] One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.

23: 

[[Job.21.24|24]] His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.

24: 

[[Job.21.25|25]] And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.

25: 

[[Job.21.26|26]] They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.

26: 

[[Job.21.27|27]] Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices \[which\] ye wrongfully imagine against me.

27: 

[[Job.21.28|28]] For ye say, Where \[is\] the house of the prince? and where \[are\] the dwelling places of the wicked?

28: 

[[Job.21.29|29]] Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,

29: 

[[Job.21.30|30]] That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.

30: 

[[Job.21.31|31]] Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him \[what\] he hath done?

31: 

[[Job.21.32|32]] Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.

32: 

[[Job.21.33|33]] The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as \[there are\] innumerable before him.

33: 

[[Job.21.34|34]] How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?

34:
