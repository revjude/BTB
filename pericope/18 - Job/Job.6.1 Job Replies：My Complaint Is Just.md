[[Job.6|Job 6:1 - Job 6:30]]
*Job Replies：My Complaint Is Just*

[[Job.6.1|1]] But Job answered and said,

1: 

[[Job.6.2|2]] Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!

2: 

[[Job.6.3|3]] For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.

3: 

[[Job.6.4|4]] For the arrows of the Almighty \[are\] within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.

4: 

[[Job.6.5|5]] Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?

5: 

[[Job.6.6|6]] Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there \[any\] taste in the white of an egg?

6: 

[[Job.6.7|7]] The things \[that\] my soul refused to touch \[are\] as my sorrowful meat.

7: 

[[Job.6.8|8]] Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant \[me\] the thing that I long for!

8: 

[[Job.6.9|9]] Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!

9: 

[[Job.6.10|10]] Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.

10: 

[[Job.6.11|11]] What \[is\] my strength, that I should hope? and what \[is\] mine end, that I should prolong my life?

11: 

[[Job.6.12|12]] \[Is\] my strength the strength of stones? or \[is\] my flesh of brass?

12: 

[[Job.6.13|13]] \[Is\] not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?

13: 

[[Job.6.14|14]] To him that is afflicted pity \[should be shewed\] from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.

14: 

[[Job.6.15|15]] My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, \[and\] as the stream of brooks they pass away;

15: 

[[Job.6.16|16]] Which are blackish by reason of the ice, \[and\] wherein the snow is hid:

16: 

[[Job.6.17|17]] What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.

17: 

[[Job.6.18|18]] The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.

18: 

[[Job.6.19|19]] The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.

19: 

[[Job.6.20|20]] They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.

20: 

[[Job.6.21|21]] For now ye are nothing; ye see \[my\] casting down, and are afraid.

21: 

[[Job.6.22|22]] Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?

22: 

[[Job.6.23|23]] Or, Deliver me from the enemy’s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?

23: 

[[Job.6.24|24]] Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.

24: 

[[Job.6.25|25]] How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?

25: 

[[Job.6.26|26]] Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, \[which are\] as wind?

26: 

[[Job.6.27|27]] Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig \[a pit\] for your friend.

27: 

[[Job.6.28|28]] Now therefore be content, look upon me; for \[it is\] evident unto you if I lie.

28: 

[[Job.6.29|29]] Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness \[is\] in it.

29: 

[[Job.6.30|30]] Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?

30:
