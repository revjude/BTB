[[Job.30|Job 30:1 - Job 30:14]]
*Job’s Honor Turned to Contempt*

[[Job.30.1|1]] But now \[they that are\] younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.

1: 

[[Job.30.2|2]] Yea, whereto \[might\] the strength of their hands \[profit\] me, in whom old age was perished?

2: 

[[Job.30.3|3]] For want and famine \[they were\] solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.

3: 

[[Job.30.4|4]] Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots \[for\] their meat.

4: 

[[Job.30.5|5]] They were driven forth from among \[men\], (they cried after them as \[after\] a thief;)

5: 

[[Job.30.6|6]] To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, \[in\] caves of the earth, and \[in\] the rocks.

6: 

[[Job.30.7|7]] Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.

7: 

[[Job.30.8|8]] \[They were\] children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.

8: 

[[Job.30.9|9]] And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.

9: 

[[Job.30.10|10]] They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.

10: 

[[Job.30.11|11]] Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.

11: 

[[Job.30.12|12]] Upon \[my\] right \[hand\] rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.

12: 

[[Job.30.13|13]] They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.

13: 

[[Job.30.14|14]] They came \[upon me\] as a wide breaking in \[of waters\]: in the desolation they rolled themselves \[upon me\].

14:
