[[Job.17|Job 17:1 - Job 17:16]]
*Job Prepares for Death*

[[Job.17.1|1]] My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves \[are ready\] for me.

1: 

[[Job.17.2|2]] \[Are there\] not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?

2: 

[[Job.17.3|3]] Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who \[is\] he \[that\] will strike hands with me?

3: 

[[Job.17.4|4]] For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt \[them\].

4: 

[[Job.17.5|5]] He that speaketh flattery to \[his\] friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.

5: 

[[Job.17.6|6]] He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.

6: 

[[Job.17.7|7]] Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members \[are\] as a shadow.

7: 

[[Job.17.8|8]] Upright \[men\] shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.

8: 

[[Job.17.9|9]] The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.

9: 

[[Job.17.10|10]] But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find \[one\] wise \[man\] among you.

10: 

[[Job.17.11|11]] My days are past, my purposes are broken off, \[even\] the thoughts of my heart.

11: 

[[Job.17.12|12]] They change the night into day: the light \[is\] short because of darkness.

12: 

[[Job.17.13|13]] If I wait, the grave \[is\] mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.

13: 

[[Job.17.14|14]] I have said to corruption, Thou \[art\] my father: to the worm, \[Thou art\] my mother, and my sister.

14: 

[[Job.17.15|15]] And where \[is\] now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?

15: 

[[Job.17.16|16]] They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when \[our\] rest together \[is\] in the dust.

16:
