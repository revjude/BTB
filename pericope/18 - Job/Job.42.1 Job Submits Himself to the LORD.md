[[Job.42|Job 42:1 - Job 42:6]]
*Job Submits Himself to the LORD*

[[Job.42.1|1]] Then Job answered the LORD, and said,

1: 

[[Job.42.2|2]] I know that thou canst do every \[thing\], and \[that\] no thought can be withholden from thee.

2: 

[[Job.42.3|3]] Who \[is\] he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.

3: 

[[Job.42.4|4]] Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.

5: 

[[Job.42.6|6]] Wherefore I abhor \[myself\], and repent in dust and ashes.
