[[Job.29|Job 29:1 - Job 29:25]]
*Job’s Former Blessings*

[[Job.29.1|1]] Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,

1: 

[[Job.29.2|2]] Oh that I were as \[in\] months past, as \[in\] the days \[when\] God preserved me;

2: 

[[Job.29.3|3]] When his candle shined upon my head, \[and when\] by his light I walked \[through\] darkness;

3: 

[[Job.29.4|4]] As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God \[was\] upon my tabernacle;

4: 

[[Job.29.5|5]] When the Almighty \[was\] yet with me, \[when\] my children \[were\] about me;

5: 

[[Job.29.6|6]] When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;

6: 

[[Job.29.7|7]] When I went out to the gate through the city, \[when\] I prepared my seat in the street!

7: 

[[Job.29.8|8]] The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, \[and\] stood up.

8: 

[[Job.29.9|9]] The princes refrained talking, and laid \[their\] hand on their mouth.

9: 

[[Job.29.10|10]] The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.

10: 

[[Job.29.11|11]] When the ear heard \[me\], then it blessed me; and when the eye saw \[me\], it gave witness to me:

11: 

[[Job.29.12|12]] Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and \[him that had\] none to help him.

12: 

[[Job.29.13|13]] The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.

13: 

[[Job.29.14|14]] I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment \[was\] as a robe and a diadem.

14: 

[[Job.29.15|15]] I was eyes to the blind, and feet \[was\] I to the lame.

15: 

[[Job.29.16|16]] I \[was\] a father to the poor: and the cause \[which\] I knew not I searched out.

16: 

[[Job.29.17|17]] And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.

17: 

[[Job.29.18|18]] Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply \[my\] days as the sand.

18: 

[[Job.29.19|19]] My root \[was\] spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.

19: 

[[Job.29.20|20]] My glory \[was\] fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.

20: 

[[Job.29.21|21]] Unto me \[men\] gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.

21: 

[[Job.29.22|22]] After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.

22: 

[[Job.29.23|23]] And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide \[as\] for the latter rain.

23: 

[[Job.29.24|24]] \[If\] I laughed on them, they believed \[it\] not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.

24: 

[[Job.29.25|25]] I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one \[that\] comforteth the mourners.

25:
