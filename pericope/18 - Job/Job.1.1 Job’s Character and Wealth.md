[[Job.1|Job 1:1 - Job 1:5]]
*Job’s Character and Wealth*

[[Job.1.1|1]] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name \[was\] Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.

1: 

[[Job.1.2|2]] And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.

2: 

[[Job.1.3|3]] His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.

3: 

[[Job.1.4|4]] And his sons went and feasted \[in their\] houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.

4: 

[[Job.1.5|5]] And it was so, when the days of \[their\] feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings \[according\] to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
