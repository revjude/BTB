[[Job.38|Job 38:1 - Job 38:41]]
*The LORD Challenges Job*

[[Job.38.1|1]] Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,

1: 

[[Job.38.2|2]] Who \[is\] this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?

2: 

[[Job.38.3|3]] Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.

3: 

[[Job.38.4|4]] Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.

4: 

[[Job.38.5|5]] Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?

5: 

[[Job.38.6|6]] Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;

6: 

[[Job.38.7|7]] When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?

7: 

[[Job.38.8|8]] Or \[who\] shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, \[as if\] it had issued out of the womb?

8: 

[[Job.38.9|9]] When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,

9: 

[[Job.38.10|10]] And brake up for it my decreed \[place\], and set bars and doors,

10: 

[[Job.38.11|11]] And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?

11: 

[[Job.38.12|12]] Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; \[and\] caused the dayspring to know his place;

12: 

[[Job.38.13|13]] That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?

13: 

[[Job.38.14|14]] It is turned as clay \[to\] the seal; and they stand as a garment.

14: 

[[Job.38.15|15]] And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.

15: 

[[Job.38.16|16]] Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?

16: 

[[Job.38.17|17]] Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?

17: 

[[Job.38.18|18]] Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.

18: 

[[Job.38.19|19]] Where \[is\] the way \[where\] light dwelleth? and \[as for\] darkness, where \[is\] the place thereof,

19: 

[[Job.38.20|20]] That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths \[to\] the house thereof?

20: 

[[Job.38.21|21]] Knowest thou \[it\], because thou wast then born? or \[because\] the number of thy days \[is\] great?

21: 

[[Job.38.22|22]] Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,

22: 

[[Job.38.23|23]] Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?

23: 

[[Job.38.24|24]] By what way is the light parted, \[which\] scattereth the east wind upon the earth?

24: 

[[Job.38.25|25]] Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;

25: 

[[Job.38.26|26]] To cause it to rain on the earth, \[where\] no man \[is; on\] the wilderness, wherein \[there is\] no man;

26: 

[[Job.38.27|27]] To satisfy the desolate and waste \[ground\]; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?

27: 

[[Job.38.28|28]] Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?

28: 

[[Job.38.29|29]] Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?

29: 

[[Job.38.30|30]] The waters are hid as \[with\] a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.

30: 

[[Job.38.31|31]] Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?

31: 

[[Job.38.32|32]] Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?

32: 

[[Job.38.33|33]] Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?

33: 

[[Job.38.34|34]] Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?

34: 

[[Job.38.35|35]] Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we \[are\]?

35: 

[[Job.38.36|36]] Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?

36: 

[[Job.38.37|37]] Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,

37: 

[[Job.38.38|38]] When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?

38: 

[[Job.38.39|39]] Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,

39: 

[[Job.38.40|40]] When they couch in \[their\] dens, \[and\] abide in the covert to lie in wait?

40: 

[[Job.38.41|41]] Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.
