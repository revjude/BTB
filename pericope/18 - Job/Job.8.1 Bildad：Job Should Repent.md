[[Job.8|Job 8:1 - Job 8:22]]
*Bildad：Job Should Repent*

[[Job.8.1|1]] Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

1: 

[[Job.8.2|2]] How long wilt thou speak these \[things\]? and \[how long shall\] the words of thy mouth \[be like\] a strong wind?

2: 

[[Job.8.3|3]] Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?

3: 

[[Job.8.4|4]] If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;

4: 

[[Job.8.5|5]] If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;

5: 

[[Job.8.6|6]] If thou \[wert\] pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.

6: 

[[Job.8.7|7]] Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.

7: 

[[Job.8.8|8]] For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:

8: 

[[Job.8.9|9]] (For we \[are but of\] yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth \[are\] a shadow:)

9: 

[[Job.8.10|10]] Shall not they teach thee, \[and\] tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?

10: 

[[Job.8.11|11]] Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?

11: 

[[Job.8.12|12]] Whilst it \[is\] yet in his greenness, \[and\] not cut down, it withereth before any \[other\] herb.

12: 

[[Job.8.13|13]] So \[are\] the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite’s hope shall perish:

13: 

[[Job.8.14|14]] Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust \[shall be\] a spider’s web.

14: 

[[Job.8.15|15]] He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.

15: 

[[Job.8.16|16]] He \[is\] green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.

16: 

[[Job.8.17|17]] His roots are wrapped about the heap, \[and\] seeth the place of stones.

17: 

[[Job.8.18|18]] If he destroy him from his place, then \[it\] shall deny him, \[saying\], I have not seen thee.

18: 

[[Job.8.19|19]] Behold, this \[is\] the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.

19: 

[[Job.8.20|20]] Behold, God will not cast away a perfect \[man\], neither will he help the evil doers:

20: 

[[Job.8.21|21]] Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.

21: 

[[Job.8.22|22]] They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.

22:
