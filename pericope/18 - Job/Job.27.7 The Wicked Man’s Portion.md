[[Job.27|Job 27:7 - Job 27:23]]
*The Wicked Man’s Portion*

[[Job.27.7|7]] Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.

7: 

[[Job.27.8|8]] For what \[is\] the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?

8: 

[[Job.27.9|9]] Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?

9: 

[[Job.27.10|10]] Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?

10: 

[[Job.27.11|11]] I will teach you by the hand of God: \[that\] which \[is\] with the Almighty will I not conceal.

11: 

[[Job.27.12|12]] Behold, all ye yourselves have seen \[it\]; why then are ye thus altogether vain?

12: 

[[Job.27.13|13]] This \[is\] the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, \[which\] they shall receive of the Almighty.

13: 

[[Job.27.14|14]] If his children be multiplied, \[it is\] for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.

14: 

[[Job.27.15|15]] Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.

15: 

[[Job.27.16|16]] Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;

16: 

[[Job.27.17|17]] He may prepare \[it\], but the just shall put \[it\] on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.

17: 

[[Job.27.18|18]] He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth \[that\] the keeper maketh.

18: 

[[Job.27.19|19]] The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he \[is\] not.

19: 

[[Job.27.20|20]] Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.

20: 

[[Job.27.21|21]] The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.

21: 

[[Job.27.22|22]] For \[God\] shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.

22: 

[[Job.27.23|23]] \[Men\] shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.

23:
