[[Job.40|Job 40:6 - Job 40:24]]
*The LORD Challenges Job Again*

[[Job.40.6|6]] Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,

6: 

[[Job.40.7|7]] Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.

7: 

[[Job.40.8|8]] Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?

8: 

[[Job.40.9|9]] Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?

9: 

[[Job.40.10|10]] Deck thyself now \[with\] majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.

10: 

[[Job.40.11|11]] Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one \[that is\] proud, and abase him.

11: 

[[Job.40.12|12]] Look on every one \[that is\] proud, \[and\] bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.

12: 

[[Job.40.13|13]] Hide them in the dust together; \[and\] bind their faces in secret.

13: 

[[Job.40.14|14]] Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.

14: 

[[Job.40.15|15]] Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.

15: 

[[Job.40.16|16]] Lo now, his strength \[is\] in his loins, and his force \[is\] in the navel of his belly.

16: 

[[Job.40.17|17]] He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.

17: 

[[Job.40.18|18]] His bones \[are as\] strong pieces of brass; his bones \[are\] like bars of iron.

18: 

[[Job.40.19|19]] He \[is\] the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach \[unto him\].

19: 

[[Job.40.20|20]] Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.

20: 

[[Job.40.21|21]] He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.

21: 

[[Job.40.22|22]] The shady trees cover him \[with\] their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.

22: 

[[Job.40.23|23]] Behold, he drinketh up a river, \[and\] hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.

23: 

[[Job.40.24|24]] He taketh it with his eyes: \[his\] nose pierceth through snares.

24:
