[[Job.23|Job 23:1 - Job 23:17]]
*Job Longs for God*

[[Job.23.1|1]] Then Job answered and said,

1: 

[[Job.23.2|2]] Even to day \[is\] my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.

2: 

[[Job.23.3|3]] Oh that I knew where I might find him! \[that\] I might come \[even\] to his seat!

3: 

[[Job.23.4|4]] I would order \[my\] cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.

4: 

[[Job.23.5|5]] I would know the words \[which\] he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.

5: 

[[Job.23.6|6]] Will he plead against me with \[his\] great power? No; but he would put \[strength\] in me.

6: 

[[Job.23.7|7]] There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.

7: 

[[Job.23.8|8]] Behold, I go forward, but he \[is\] not \[there\]; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:

8: 

[[Job.23.9|9]] On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold \[him\]: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see \[him\]:

9: 

[[Job.23.10|10]] But he knoweth the way that I take: \[when\] he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.

10: 

[[Job.23.11|11]] My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.

11: 

[[Job.23.12|12]] Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary \[food\].

12: 

[[Job.23.13|13]] But he \[is\] in one \[mind\], and who can turn him? and \[what\] his soul desireth, even \[that\] he doeth.

13: 

[[Job.23.14|14]] For he performeth \[the thing that is\] appointed for me: and many such \[things are\] with him.

14: 

[[Job.23.15|15]] Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.

15: 

[[Job.23.16|16]] For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:

16: 

[[Job.23.17|17]] Because I was not cut off before the darkness, \[neither\] hath he covered the darkness from my face.

17:
