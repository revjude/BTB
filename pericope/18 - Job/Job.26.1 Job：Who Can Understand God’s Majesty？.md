[[Job.26|Job 26:1 - Job 26:14]]
*Job：Who Can Understand God’s Majesty？*

[[Job.26.1|1]] But Job answered and said,

1: 

[[Job.26.2|2]] How hast thou helped \[him that is\] without power? \[how\] savest thou the arm \[that hath\] no strength?

2: 

[[Job.26.3|3]] How hast thou counselled \[him that hath\] no wisdom? and \[how\] hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?

3: 

[[Job.26.4|4]] To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?

4: 

[[Job.26.5|5]] Dead \[things\] are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.

5: 

[[Job.26.6|6]] Hell \[is\] naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.

6: 

[[Job.26.7|7]] He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, \[and\] hangeth the earth upon nothing.

7: 

[[Job.26.8|8]] He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.

8: 

[[Job.26.9|9]] He holdeth back the face of his throne, \[and\] spreadeth his cloud upon it.

9: 

[[Job.26.10|10]] He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.

10: 

[[Job.26.11|11]] The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.

11: 

[[Job.26.12|12]] He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.

12: 

[[Job.26.13|13]] By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.

13: 

[[Job.26.14|14]] Lo, these \[are\] parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?

14:
