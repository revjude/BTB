[[Job.20|Job 20:1 - Job 20:29]]
*Zophar：Destruction Awaits the Wicked*

[[Job.20.1|1]] Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,

1: 

[[Job.20.2|2]] Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for \[this\] I make haste.

2: 

[[Job.20.3|3]] I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.

3: 

[[Job.20.4|4]] Knowest thou \[not\] this of old, since man was placed upon earth,

4: 

[[Job.20.5|5]] That the triumphing of the wicked \[is\] short, and the joy of the hypocrite \[but\] for a moment?

5: 

[[Job.20.6|6]] Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;

6: 

[[Job.20.7|7]] \[Yet\] he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where \[is\] he?

7: 

[[Job.20.8|8]] He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.

8: 

[[Job.20.9|9]] The eye also \[which\] saw him shall \[see him\] no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.

9: 

[[Job.20.10|10]] His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.

10: 

[[Job.20.11|11]] His bones are full \[of the sin\] of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.

11: 

[[Job.20.12|12]] Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, \[though\] he hide it under his tongue;

12: 

[[Job.20.13|13]] \[Though\] he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:

13: 

[[Job.20.14|14]] \[Yet\] his meat in his bowels is turned, \[it is\] the gall of asps within him.

14: 

[[Job.20.15|15]] He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.

15: 

[[Job.20.16|16]] He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper’s tongue shall slay him.

16: 

[[Job.20.17|17]] He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.

17: 

[[Job.20.18|18]] That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow \[it\] down: according to \[his\] substance \[shall\] the restitution \[be\], and he shall not rejoice \[therein\].

18: 

[[Job.20.19|19]] Because he hath oppressed \[and\] hath forsaken the poor; \[because\] he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;

19: 

[[Job.20.20|20]] Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.

20: 

[[Job.20.21|21]] There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.

21: 

[[Job.20.22|22]] In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.

22: 

[[Job.20.23|23]] \[When\] he is about to fill his belly, \[God\] shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain \[it\] upon him while he is eating.

23: 

[[Job.20.24|24]] He shall flee from the iron weapon, \[and\] the bow of steel shall strike him through.

24: 

[[Job.20.25|25]] It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors \[are\] upon him.

25: 

[[Job.20.26|26]] All darkness \[shall be\] hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.

26: 

[[Job.20.27|27]] The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.

27: 

[[Job.20.28|28]] The increase of his house shall depart, \[and his goods\] shall flow away in the day of his wrath.

28: 

[[Job.20.29|29]] This \[is\] the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.

29:
