[[Job.39|Job 39:1 - Job 39:30]]
*The LORD Speaks of His Creation*

[[Job.39.1|1]] Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? \[or\] canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?

1: 

[[Job.39.2|2]] Canst thou number the months \[that\] they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?

2: 

[[Job.39.3|3]] They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.

3: 

[[Job.39.4|4]] Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.

4: 

[[Job.39.5|5]] Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?

5: 

[[Job.39.6|6]] Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.

6: 

[[Job.39.7|7]] He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.

7: 

[[Job.39.8|8]] The range of the mountains \[is\] his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.

8: 

[[Job.39.9|9]] Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?

9: 

[[Job.39.10|10]] Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?

10: 

[[Job.39.11|11]] Wilt thou trust him, because his strength \[is\] great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?

11: 

[[Job.39.12|12]] Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather \[it into\] thy barn?

12: 

[[Job.39.13|13]] \[Gavest thou\] the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?

13: 

[[Job.39.14|14]] Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,

14: 

[[Job.39.15|15]] And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.

15: 

[[Job.39.16|16]] She is hardened against her young ones, as though \[they were\] not hers: her labour is in vain without fear;

16: 

[[Job.39.17|17]] Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.

17: 

[[Job.39.18|18]] What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.

18: 

[[Job.39.19|19]] Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?

19: 

[[Job.39.20|20]] Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils \[is\] terrible.

20: 

[[Job.39.21|21]] He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in \[his\] strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.

21: 

[[Job.39.22|22]] He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.

22: 

[[Job.39.23|23]] The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.

23: 

[[Job.39.24|24]] He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that \[it is\] the sound of the trumpet.

24: 

[[Job.39.25|25]] He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.

25: 

[[Job.39.26|26]] Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, \[and\] stretch her wings toward the south?

26: 

[[Job.39.27|27]] Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?

27: 

[[Job.39.28|28]] She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.

28: 

[[Job.39.29|29]] From thence she seeketh the prey, \[and\] her eyes behold afar off.

29: 

[[Job.39.30|30]] Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain \[are\], there \[is\] she.

30:
