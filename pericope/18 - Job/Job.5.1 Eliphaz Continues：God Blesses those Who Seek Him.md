[[Job.5|Job 5:1 - Job 5:27]]
*Eliphaz Continues：God Blesses those Who Seek Him*

[[Job.5.1|1]] Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?

1: 

[[Job.5.2|2]] For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.

2: 

[[Job.5.3|3]] I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.

3: 

[[Job.5.4|4]] His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither \[is there\] any to deliver \[them\].

4: 

[[Job.5.5|5]] Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.

5: 

[[Job.5.6|6]] Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;

6: 

[[Job.5.7|7]] Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.

7: 

[[Job.5.8|8]] I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:

8: 

[[Job.5.9|9]] Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:

9: 

[[Job.5.10|10]] Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:

10: 

[[Job.5.11|11]] To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.

11: 

[[Job.5.12|12]] He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform \[their\] enterprise.

12: 

[[Job.5.13|13]] He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.

13: 

[[Job.5.14|14]] They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.

14: 

[[Job.5.15|15]] But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.

15: 

[[Job.5.16|16]] So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.

16: 

[[Job.5.17|17]] Behold, happy \[is\] the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:

17: 

[[Job.5.18|18]] For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.

18: 

[[Job.5.19|19]] He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.

19: 

[[Job.5.20|20]] In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.

20: 

[[Job.5.21|21]] Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.

21: 

[[Job.5.22|22]] At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.

22: 

[[Job.5.23|23]] For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.

23: 

[[Job.5.24|24]] And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle \[shall be\] in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.

24: 

[[Job.5.25|25]] Thou shalt know also that thy seed \[shall be\] great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.

25: 

[[Job.5.26|26]] Thou shalt come to \[thy\] grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.

26: 

[[Job.5.27|27]] Lo this, we have searched it, so it \[is\]; hear it, and know thou \[it\] for thy good.

27:
