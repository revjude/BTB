[[Job.4|Job 4:1 - Job 4:21]]
*Eliphaz：The Innocent Prosper*

[[Job.4.1|1]] Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

1: 

[[Job.4.2|2]] \[If\] we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?

2: 

[[Job.4.3|3]] Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.

3: 

[[Job.4.4|4]] Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.

4: 

[[Job.4.5|5]] But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.

5: 

[[Job.4.6|6]] \[Is\] not \[this\] thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?

6: 

[[Job.4.7|7]] Remember, I pray thee, who \[ever\] perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?

7: 

[[Job.4.8|8]] Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.

8: 

[[Job.4.9|9]] By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.

9: 

[[Job.4.10|10]] The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.

10: 

[[Job.4.11|11]] The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad.

11: 

[[Job.4.12|12]] Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.

12: 

[[Job.4.13|13]] In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,

13: 

[[Job.4.14|14]] Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.

14: 

[[Job.4.15|15]] Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:

15: 

[[Job.4.16|16]] It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image \[was\] before mine eyes, \[there was\] silence, and I heard a voice, \[saying\],

16: 

[[Job.4.17|17]] Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?

17: 

[[Job.4.18|18]] Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:

18: 

[[Job.4.19|19]] How much less \[in\] them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation \[is\] in the dust, \[which\] are crushed before the moth?

19: 

[[Job.4.20|20]] They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding \[it\].

20: 

[[Job.4.21|21]] Doth not their excellency \[which is\] in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.

21:
