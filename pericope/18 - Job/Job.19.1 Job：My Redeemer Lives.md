[[Job.19|Job 19:1 - Job 19:29]]
*Job：My Redeemer Lives*

[[Job.19.1|1]] Then Job answered and said,

1: 

[[Job.19.2|2]] How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?

2: 

[[Job.19.3|3]] These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed \[that\] ye make yourselves strange to me.

3: 

[[Job.19.4|4]] And be it indeed \[that\] I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.

4: 

[[Job.19.5|5]] If indeed ye will magnify \[yourselves\] against me, and plead against me my reproach:

5: 

[[Job.19.6|6]] Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.

6: 

[[Job.19.7|7]] Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but \[there is\] no judgment.

7: 

[[Job.19.8|8]] He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.

8: 

[[Job.19.9|9]] He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown \[from\] my head.

9: 

[[Job.19.10|10]] He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.

10: 

[[Job.19.11|11]] He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as \[one of\] his enemies.

11: 

[[Job.19.12|12]] His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.

12: 

[[Job.19.13|13]] He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.

13: 

[[Job.19.14|14]] My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.

14: 

[[Job.19.15|15]] They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.

15: 

[[Job.19.16|16]] I called my servant, and he gave \[me\] no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.

16: 

[[Job.19.17|17]] My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children’s \[sake\] of mine own body.

17: 

[[Job.19.18|18]] Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.

18: 

[[Job.19.19|19]] All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.

19: 

[[Job.19.20|20]] My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.

20: 

[[Job.19.21|21]] Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.

21: 

[[Job.19.22|22]] Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?

22: 

[[Job.19.23|23]] Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!

23: 

[[Job.19.24|24]] That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!

24: 

[[Job.19.25|25]] For I know \[that\] my redeemer liveth, and \[that\] he shall stand at the latter \[day\] upon the earth:

25: 

[[Job.19.26|26]] And \[though\] after my skin \[worms\] destroy this \[body\], yet in my flesh shall I see God:

26: 

[[Job.19.27|27]] Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; \[though\] my reins be consumed within me.

27: 

[[Job.19.28|28]] But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?

28: 

[[Job.19.29|29]] Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath \[bringeth\] the punishments of the sword, that ye may know \[there is\] a judgment.

29:
