[[Job.35|Job 35:1 - Job 35:16]]
*Elihu Recalls God’s Justice*

[[Job.35.1|1]] Elihu spake moreover, and said,

1: 

[[Job.35.2|2]] Thinkest thou this to be right, \[that\] thou saidst, My righteousness \[is\] more than God’s?

2: 

[[Job.35.3|3]] For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? \[and\], What profit shall I have, \[if I be cleansed\] from my sin?

3: 

[[Job.35.4|4]] I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.

4: 

[[Job.35.5|5]] Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds \[which\] are higher than thou.

5: 

[[Job.35.6|6]] If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or \[if\] thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?

6: 

[[Job.35.7|7]] If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?

7: 

[[Job.35.8|8]] Thy wickedness \[may hurt\] a man as thou \[art\]; and thy righteousness \[may profit\] the son of man.

8: 

[[Job.35.9|9]] By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make \[the oppressed\] to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.

9: 

[[Job.35.10|10]] But none saith, Where \[is\] God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;

10: 

[[Job.35.11|11]] Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?

11: 

[[Job.35.12|12]] There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.

12: 

[[Job.35.13|13]] Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.

13: 

[[Job.35.14|14]] Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, \[yet\] judgment \[is\] before him; therefore trust thou in him.

14: 

[[Job.35.15|15]] But now, because \[it is\] not \[so\], he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth \[it\] not in great extremity:

15: 

[[Job.35.16|16]] Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.

16:
