[[Job.22|Job 22:1 - Job 22:30]]
*Eliphaz：Can a Man Be of Use to God？*

[[Job.22.1|1]] Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

1: 

[[Job.22.2|2]] Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?

2: 

[[Job.22.3|3]] \[Is it\] any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or \[is it\] gain \[to him\], that thou makest thy ways perfect?

3: 

[[Job.22.4|4]] Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?

4: 

[[Job.22.5|5]] \[Is\] not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?

5: 

[[Job.22.6|6]] For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.

6: 

[[Job.22.7|7]] Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.

7: 

[[Job.22.8|8]] But \[as for\] the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.

8: 

[[Job.22.9|9]] Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.

9: 

[[Job.22.10|10]] Therefore snares \[are\] round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;

10: 

[[Job.22.11|11]] Or darkness, \[that\] thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.

11: 

[[Job.22.12|12]] \[Is\] not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!

12: 

[[Job.22.13|13]] And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?

13: 

[[Job.22.14|14]] Thick clouds \[are\] a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.

14: 

[[Job.22.15|15]] Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?

15: 

[[Job.22.16|16]] Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:

16: 

[[Job.22.17|17]] Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?

17: 

[[Job.22.18|18]] Yet he filled their houses with good \[things\]: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.

18: 

[[Job.22.19|19]] The righteous see \[it\], and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.

19: 

[[Job.22.20|20]] Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.

20: 

[[Job.22.21|21]] Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.

21: 

[[Job.22.22|22]] Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.

22: 

[[Job.22.23|23]] If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.

23: 

[[Job.22.24|24]] Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the \[gold\] of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.

24: 

[[Job.22.25|25]] Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.

25: 

[[Job.22.26|26]] For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.

26: 

[[Job.22.27|27]] Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.

27: 

[[Job.22.28|28]] Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.

28: 

[[Job.22.29|29]] When \[men\] are cast down, then thou shalt say, \[There is\] lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.

29: 

[[Job.22.30|30]] He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.

30:
