[[Job.12|Job 12:1 - Job 12:25]]
*Job Presents His Case*

[[Job.12.1|1]] And Job answered and said,

1: 

[[Job.12.2|2]] No doubt but ye \[are\] the people, and wisdom shall die with you.

2: 

[[Job.12.3|3]] But I have understanding as well as you; I \[am\] not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?

3: 

[[Job.12.4|4]] I am \[as\] one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright \[man is\] laughed to scorn.

4: 

[[Job.12.5|5]] He that is ready to slip with \[his\] feet \[is as\] a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.

5: 

[[Job.12.6|6]] The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth \[abundantly\].

6: 

[[Job.12.7|7]] But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:

7: 

[[Job.12.8|8]] Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.

8: 

[[Job.12.9|9]] Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?

9: 

[[Job.12.10|10]] In whose hand \[is\] the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.

10: 

[[Job.12.11|11]] Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?

11: 

[[Job.12.12|12]] With the ancient \[is\] wisdom; and in length of days understanding.

12: 

[[Job.12.13|13]] With him \[is\] wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.

13: 

[[Job.12.14|14]] Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.

14: 

[[Job.12.15|15]] Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.

15: 

[[Job.12.16|16]] With him \[is\] strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver \[are\] his.

16: 

[[Job.12.17|17]] He leadeth counsellers away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.

17: 

[[Job.12.18|18]] He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.

18: 

[[Job.12.19|19]] He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.

19: 

[[Job.12.20|20]] He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.

20: 

[[Job.12.21|21]] He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.

21: 

[[Job.12.22|22]] He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.

22: 

[[Job.12.23|23]] He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them \[again\].

23: 

[[Job.12.24|24]] He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness \[where there is\] no way.

24: 

[[Job.12.25|25]] They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like \[a\] drunken \[man\].

25:
