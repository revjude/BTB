[[Job.9|Job 9:1 - Job 9:35]]
*Job：How Can I Contend with God？*

[[Job.9.1|1]] Then Job answered and said,

1: 

[[Job.9.2|2]] I know \[it is\] so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?

2: 

[[Job.9.3|3]] If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.

3: 

[[Job.9.4|4]] \[He is\] wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened \[himself\] against him, and hath prospered?

4: 

[[Job.9.5|5]] Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.

5: 

[[Job.9.6|6]] Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.

6: 

[[Job.9.7|7]] Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.

7: 

[[Job.9.8|8]] Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.

8: 

[[Job.9.9|9]] Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.

9: 

[[Job.9.10|10]] Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.

10: 

[[Job.9.11|11]] Lo, he goeth by me, and I see \[him\] not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.

11: 

[[Job.9.12|12]] Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?

12: 

[[Job.9.13|13]] \[If\] God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.

13: 

[[Job.9.14|14]] How much less shall I answer him, \[and\] choose out my words \[to reason\] with him?

14: 

[[Job.9.15|15]] Whom, though I were righteous, \[yet\] would I not answer, \[but\] I would make supplication to my judge.

15: 

[[Job.9.16|16]] If I had called, and he had answered me; \[yet\] would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.

16: 

[[Job.9.17|17]] For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.

17: 

[[Job.9.18|18]] He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.

18: 

[[Job.9.19|19]] If \[I speak\] of strength, lo, \[he is\] strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time \[to plead\]?

19: 

[[Job.9.20|20]] If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: \[if I say\], I \[am\] perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.

20: 

[[Job.9.21|21]] \[Though\] I \[were\] perfect, \[yet\] would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.

21: 

[[Job.9.22|22]] This \[is\] one \[thing\], therefore I said \[it\], He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.

22: 

[[Job.9.23|23]] If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.

23: 

[[Job.9.24|24]] The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, \[and\] who \[is\] he?

24: 

[[Job.9.25|25]] Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.

25: 

[[Job.9.26|26]] They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle \[that\] hasteth to the prey.

26: 

[[Job.9.27|27]] If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort \[myself\]:

27: 

[[Job.9.28|28]] I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.

28: 

[[Job.9.29|29]] \[If\] I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?

29: 

[[Job.9.30|30]] If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;

30: 

[[Job.9.31|31]] Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.

31: 

[[Job.9.32|32]] For \[he is\] not a man, as I \[am, that\] I should answer him, \[and\] we should come together in judgment.

32: 

[[Job.9.33|33]] Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, \[that\] might lay his hand upon us both.

33: 

[[Job.9.34|34]] Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:

34: 

[[Job.9.35|35]] \[Then\] would I speak, and not fear him; but \[it is\] not so with me.

35:
