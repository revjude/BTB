[[Job.41|Job 41:1 - Job 41:34]]
*The LORD’s Power Shown in Leviathan*

[[Job.41.1|1]] Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord \[which\] thou lettest down?

1: 

[[Job.41.2|2]] Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?

2: 

[[Job.41.3|3]] Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft \[words\] unto thee?

3: 

[[Job.41.4|4]] Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?

4: 

[[Job.41.5|5]] Wilt thou play with him as \[with\] a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?

5: 

[[Job.41.6|6]] Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?

6: 

[[Job.41.7|7]] Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?

7: 

[[Job.41.8|8]] Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.

8: 

[[Job.41.9|9]] Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not \[one\] be cast down even at the sight of him?

9: 

[[Job.41.10|10]] None \[is so\] fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?

10: 

[[Job.41.11|11]] Who hath prevented me, that I should repay \[him? whatsoever is\] under the whole heaven is mine.

11: 

[[Job.41.12|12]] I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.

12: 

[[Job.41.13|13]] Who can discover the face of his garment? \[or\] who can come \[to him\] with his double bridle?

13: 

[[Job.41.14|14]] Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth \[are\] terrible round about.

14: 

[[Job.41.15|15]] \[His\] scales \[are his\] pride, shut up together \[as with\] a close seal.

15: 

[[Job.41.16|16]] One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.

16: 

[[Job.41.17|17]] They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.

17: 

[[Job.41.18|18]] By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes \[are\] like the eyelids of the morning.

18: 

[[Job.41.19|19]] Out of his mouth go burning lamps, \[and\] sparks of fire leap out.

19: 

[[Job.41.20|20]] Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as \[out\] of a seething pot or caldron.

20: 

[[Job.41.21|21]] His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.

21: 

[[Job.41.22|22]] In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.

22: 

[[Job.41.23|23]] The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.

23: 

[[Job.41.24|24]] His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether \[millstone\].

24: 

[[Job.41.25|25]] When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.

25: 

[[Job.41.26|26]] The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.

26: 

[[Job.41.27|27]] He esteemeth iron as straw, \[and\] brass as rotten wood.

27: 

[[Job.41.28|28]] The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.

28: 

[[Job.41.29|29]] Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.

29: 

[[Job.41.30|30]] Sharp stones \[are\] under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.

30: 

[[Job.41.31|31]] He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.

31: 

[[Job.41.32|32]] He maketh a path to shine after him; \[one\] would think the deep \[to be\] hoary.

32: 

[[Job.41.33|33]] Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.

33: 

[[Job.41.34|34]] He beholdeth all high \[things\]: he \[is\] a king over all the children of pride.

34:
