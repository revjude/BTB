[[Job.34|Job 34:1 - Job 34:37]]
*Elihu Confirms God’s Justice*

[[Job.34.1|1]] Furthermore Elihu answered and said,

1: 

[[Job.34.2|2]] Hear my words, O ye wise \[men\]; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.

2: 

[[Job.34.3|3]] For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.

3: 

[[Job.34.4|4]] Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what \[is\] good.

4: 

[[Job.34.5|5]] For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.

5: 

[[Job.34.6|6]] Should I lie against my right? my wound \[is\] incurable without transgression.

6: 

[[Job.34.7|7]] What man \[is\] like Job, \[who\] drinketh up scorning like water?

7: 

[[Job.34.8|8]] Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.

8: 

[[Job.34.9|9]] For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.

9: 

[[Job.34.10|10]] Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, \[that he should do\] wickedness; and \[from\] the Almighty, \[that he should commit\] iniquity.

10: 

[[Job.34.11|11]] For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to \[his\] ways.

11: 

[[Job.34.12|12]] Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.

12: 

[[Job.34.13|13]] Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?

13: 

[[Job.34.14|14]] If he set his heart upon man, \[if\] he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;

14: 

[[Job.34.15|15]] All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.

15: 

[[Job.34.16|16]] If now \[thou hast\] understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.

16: 

[[Job.34.17|17]] Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?

17: 

[[Job.34.18|18]] \[Is it fit\] to say to a king, \[Thou art\] wicked? \[and\] to princes, \[Ye are\] ungodly?

18: 

[[Job.34.19|19]] \[How much less to him\] that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all \[are\] the work of his hands.

19: 

[[Job.34.20|20]] In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.

20: 

[[Job.34.21|21]] For his eyes \[are\] upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.

21: 

[[Job.34.22|22]] \[There is\] no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.

22: 

[[Job.34.23|23]] For he will not lay upon man more \[than right\]; that he should enter into judgment with God.

23: 

[[Job.34.24|24]] He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.

24: 

[[Job.34.25|25]] Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth \[them\] in the night, so that they are destroyed.

25: 

[[Job.34.26|26]] He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;

26: 

[[Job.34.27|27]] Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:

27: 

[[Job.34.28|28]] So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.

28: 

[[Job.34.29|29]] When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth \[his\] face, who then can behold him? whether \[it be done\] against a nation, or against a man only:

29: 

[[Job.34.30|30]] That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.

30: 

[[Job.34.31|31]] Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne \[chastisement\], I will not offend \[any more\]:

31: 

[[Job.34.32|32]] \[That which\] I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.

32: 

[[Job.34.33|33]] \[Should it be\] according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.

33: 

[[Job.34.34|34]] Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.

34: 

[[Job.34.35|35]] Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words \[were\] without wisdom.

35: 

[[Job.34.36|36]] My desire \[is that\] Job may be tried unto the end because of \[his\] answers for wicked men.

36: 

[[Job.34.37|37]] For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth \[his hands\] among us, and multiplieth his words against God.

37:
