[[Job.10|Job 10:1 - Job 10:22]]
*Job’s Plea to God*

[[Job.10.1|1]] My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.

1: 

[[Job.10.2|2]] I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.

2: 

[[Job.10.3|3]] \[Is it\] good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?

3: 

[[Job.10.4|4]] Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?

4: 

[[Job.10.5|5]] \[Are\] thy days as the days of man? \[are\] thy years as man’s days,

5: 

[[Job.10.6|6]] That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?

6: 

[[Job.10.7|7]] Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and \[there is\] none that can deliver out of thine hand.

7: 

[[Job.10.8|8]] Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.

8: 

[[Job.10.9|9]] Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?

9: 

[[Job.10.10|10]] Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?

10: 

[[Job.10.11|11]] Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.

11: 

[[Job.10.12|12]] Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.

12: 

[[Job.10.13|13]] And these \[things\] hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this \[is\] with thee.

13: 

[[Job.10.14|14]] If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.

14: 

[[Job.10.15|15]] If I be wicked, woe unto me; and \[if\] I be righteous, \[yet\] will I not lift up my head. \[I am\] full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;

15: 

[[Job.10.16|16]] For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.

16: 

[[Job.10.17|17]] Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war \[are\] against me.

17: 

[[Job.10.18|18]] Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!

18: 

[[Job.10.19|19]] I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.

19: 

[[Job.10.20|20]] \[Are\] not my days few? cease \[then, and\] let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,

20: 

[[Job.10.21|21]] Before I go \[whence\] I shall not return, \[even\] to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;

21: 

[[Job.10.22|22]] A land of darkness, as darkness \[itself; and\] of the shadow of death, without any order, and \[where\] the light \[is\] as darkness.

22:
