[[Job.27|Job 27:1 - Job 27:6]]
*Job Affirms His Integrity*

[[Job.27.1|1]] Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,

1: 

[[Job.27.2|2]] \[As\] God liveth, \[who\] hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, \[who\] hath vexed my soul;

2: 

[[Job.27.3|3]] All the while my breath \[is\] in me, and the spirit of God \[is\] in my nostrils;

3: 

[[Job.27.4|4]] My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.

4: 

[[Job.27.5|5]] God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.

5: 

[[Job.27.6|6]] My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach \[me\] so long as I live.

6:
