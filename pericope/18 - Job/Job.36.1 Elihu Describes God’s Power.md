[[Job.36|Job 36:1 - Job 36:33]]
*Elihu Describes God’s Power*

[[Job.36.1|1]] Elihu also proceeded, and said,

1: 

[[Job.36.2|2]] Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that \[I have\] yet to speak on God’s behalf.

2: 

[[Job.36.3|3]] I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.

3: 

[[Job.36.4|4]] For truly my words \[shall\] not \[be\] false: he that is perfect in knowledge \[is\] with thee.

4: 

[[Job.36.5|5]] Behold, God \[is\] mighty, and despiseth not \[any: he is\] mighty in strength \[and\] wisdom.

5: 

[[Job.36.6|6]] He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.

6: 

[[Job.36.7|7]] He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings \[are they\] on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.

7: 

[[Job.36.8|8]] And if \[they be\] bound in fetters, \[and\] be holden in cords of affliction;

8: 

[[Job.36.9|9]] Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.

9: 

[[Job.36.10|10]] He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.

10: 

[[Job.36.11|11]] If they obey and serve \[him\], they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.

11: 

[[Job.36.12|12]] But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.

12: 

[[Job.36.13|13]] But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.

13: 

[[Job.36.14|14]] They die in youth, and their life \[is\] among the unclean.

14: 

[[Job.36.15|15]] He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.

15: 

[[Job.36.16|16]] Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait \[into\] a broad place, where \[there is\] no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table \[should be\] full of fatness.

16: 

[[Job.36.17|17]] But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold \[on thee\].

17: 

[[Job.36.18|18]] Because \[there is\] wrath, \[beware\] lest he take thee away with \[his\] stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.

18: 

[[Job.36.19|19]] Will he esteem thy riches? \[no\], not gold, nor all the forces of strength.

19: 

[[Job.36.20|20]] Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.

20: 

[[Job.36.21|21]] Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.

21: 

[[Job.36.22|22]] Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?

22: 

[[Job.36.23|23]] Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?

23: 

[[Job.36.24|24]] Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.

24: 

[[Job.36.25|25]] Every man may see it; man may behold \[it\] afar off.

25: 

[[Job.36.26|26]] Behold, God \[is\] great, and we know \[him\] not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.

26: 

[[Job.36.27|27]] For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:

27: 

[[Job.36.28|28]] Which the clouds do drop \[and\] distil upon man abundantly.

28: 

[[Job.36.29|29]] Also can \[any\] understand the spreadings of the clouds, \[or\] the noise of his tabernacle?

29: 

[[Job.36.30|30]] Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.

30: 

[[Job.36.31|31]] For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.

31: 

[[Job.36.32|32]] With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it \[not to shine\] by \[the cloud\] that cometh betwixt.

32: 

[[Job.36.33|33]] The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.

33:
