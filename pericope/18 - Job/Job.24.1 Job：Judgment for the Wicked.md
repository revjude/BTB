[[Job.24|Job 24:1 - Job 24:25]]
*Job：Judgment for the Wicked*

[[Job.24.1|1]] Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?

1: 

[[Job.24.2|2]] \[Some\] remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed \[thereof\].

2: 

[[Job.24.3|3]] They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow’s ox for a pledge.

3: 

[[Job.24.4|4]] They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.

4: 

[[Job.24.5|5]] Behold, \[as\] wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness \[yieldeth\] food for them \[and\] for \[their\] children.

5: 

[[Job.24.6|6]] They reap \[every one\] his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.

6: 

[[Job.24.7|7]] They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that \[they have\] no covering in the cold.

7: 

[[Job.24.8|8]] They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.

8: 

[[Job.24.9|9]] They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.

9: 

[[Job.24.10|10]] They cause \[him\] to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf \[from\] the hungry;

10: 

[[Job.24.11|11]] \[Which\] make oil within their walls, \[and\] tread \[their\] winepresses, and suffer thirst.

11: 

[[Job.24.12|12]] Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly \[to them\].

12: 

[[Job.24.13|13]] They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.

13: 

[[Job.24.14|14]] The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.

14: 

[[Job.24.15|15]] The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth \[his\] face.

15: 

[[Job.24.16|16]] In the dark they dig through houses, \[which\] they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.

16: 

[[Job.24.17|17]] For the morning \[is\] to them even as the shadow of death: if \[one\] know \[them, they are in\] the terrors of the shadow of death.

17: 

[[Job.24.18|18]] He \[is\] swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.

18: 

[[Job.24.19|19]] Drought and heat consume the snow waters: \[so doth\] the grave \[those which\] have sinned.

19: 

[[Job.24.20|20]] The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.

20: 

[[Job.24.21|21]] He evil entreateth the barren \[that\] beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.

21: 

[[Job.24.22|22]] He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no \[man\] is sure of life.

22: 

[[Job.24.23|23]] \[Though\] it be given him \[to be\] in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes \[are\] upon their ways.

23: 

[[Job.24.24|24]] They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all \[other\], and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.

24: 

[[Job.24.25|25]] And if \[it be\] not \[so\] now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?

25:
