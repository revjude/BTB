[[Job.30|Job 30:15 - Job 30:31]]
*Job’s Prosperity Becomes Calamity*

[[Job.30.15|15]] Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.

15: 

[[Job.30.16|16]] And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.

16: 

[[Job.30.17|17]] My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.

17: 

[[Job.30.18|18]] By the great force \[of my disease\] is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.

18: 

[[Job.30.19|19]] He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.

19: 

[[Job.30.20|20]] I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me \[not\].

20: 

[[Job.30.21|21]] Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.

21: 

[[Job.30.22|22]] Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride \[upon it\], and dissolvest my substance.

22: 

[[Job.30.23|23]] For I know \[that\] thou wilt bring me \[to\] death, and \[to\] the house appointed for all living.

23: 

[[Job.30.24|24]] Howbeit he will not stretch out \[his\] hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.

24: 

[[Job.30.25|25]] Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was \[not\] my soul grieved for the poor?

25: 

[[Job.30.26|26]] When I looked for good, then evil came \[unto me\]: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.

26: 

[[Job.30.27|27]] My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.

27: 

[[Job.30.28|28]] I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, \[and\] I cried in the congregation.

28: 

[[Job.30.29|29]] I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.

29: 

[[Job.30.30|30]] My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.

30: 

[[Job.30.31|31]] My harp also is \[turned\] to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.

31:
