[[Job.13|Job 13:1 - Job 13:28]]
*Job Prepares His Case*

[[Job.13.1|1]] Lo, mine eye hath seen all \[this\], mine ear hath heard and understood it.

1: 

[[Job.13.2|2]] What ye know, \[the same\] do I know also: I \[am\] not inferior unto you.

2: 

[[Job.13.3|3]] Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.

3: 

[[Job.13.4|4]] But ye \[are\] forgers of lies, ye \[are\] all physicians of no value.

4: 

[[Job.13.5|5]] O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.

5: 

[[Job.13.6|6]] Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.

6: 

[[Job.13.7|7]] Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?

7: 

[[Job.13.8|8]] Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?

8: 

[[Job.13.9|9]] Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye \[so\] mock him?

9: 

[[Job.13.10|10]] He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.

10: 

[[Job.13.11|11]] Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?

11: 

[[Job.13.12|12]] Your remembrances \[are\] like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.

12: 

[[Job.13.13|13]] Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what \[will\].

13: 

[[Job.13.14|14]] Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?

14: 

[[Job.13.15|15]] Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.

15: 

[[Job.13.16|16]] He also \[shall be\] my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.

16: 

[[Job.13.17|17]] Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.

17: 

[[Job.13.18|18]] Behold now, I have ordered \[my\] cause; I know that I shall be justified.

18: 

[[Job.13.19|19]] Who \[is\] he \[that\] will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.

19: 

[[Job.13.20|20]] Only do not two \[things\] unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.

20: 

[[Job.13.21|21]] Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.

21: 

[[Job.13.22|22]] Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.

22: 

[[Job.13.23|23]] How many \[are\] mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.

23: 

[[Job.13.24|24]] Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?

24: 

[[Job.13.25|25]] Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?

25: 

[[Job.13.26|26]] For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.

26: 

[[Job.13.27|27]] Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.

27: 

[[Job.13.28|28]] And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.

28:
