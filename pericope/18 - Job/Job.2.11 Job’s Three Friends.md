[[Job.2|Job 2:11 - Job 2:13]]
*Job’s Three Friends*

[[Job.2.11|11]] Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.

11: 

[[Job.2.12|12]] And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.

12: 

[[Job.2.13|13]] So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that \[his\] grief was very great.

13:
