[[Job.15|Job 15:1 - Job 15:35]]
*Eliphaz：Job Does Not Fear God*

[[Job.15.1|1]] Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,

1: 

[[Job.15.2|2]] Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?

2: 

[[Job.15.3|3]] Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?

3: 

[[Job.15.4|4]] Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.

4: 

[[Job.15.5|5]] For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.

5: 

[[Job.15.6|6]] Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.

6: 

[[Job.15.7|7]] \[Art\] thou the first man \[that\] was born? or wast thou made before the hills?

7: 

[[Job.15.8|8]] Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?

8: 

[[Job.15.9|9]] What knowest thou, that we know not? \[what\] understandest thou, which \[is\] not in us?

9: 

[[Job.15.10|10]] With us \[are\] both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.

10: 

[[Job.15.11|11]] \[Are\] the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?

11: 

[[Job.15.12|12]] Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,

12: 

[[Job.15.13|13]] That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest \[such\] words go out of thy mouth?

13: 

[[Job.15.14|14]] What \[is\] man, that he should be clean? and \[he which is\] born of a woman, that he should be righteous?

14: 

[[Job.15.15|15]] Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.

15: 

[[Job.15.16|16]] How much more abominable and filthy \[is\] man, which drinketh iniquity like water?

16: 

[[Job.15.17|17]] I will shew thee, hear me; and that \[which\] I have seen I will declare;

17: 

[[Job.15.18|18]] Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid \[it\]:

18: 

[[Job.15.19|19]] Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.

19: 

[[Job.15.20|20]] The wicked man travaileth with pain all \[his\] days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.

20: 

[[Job.15.21|21]] A dreadful sound \[is\] in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.

21: 

[[Job.15.22|22]] He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.

22: 

[[Job.15.23|23]] He wandereth abroad for bread, \[saying\], Where \[is it\]? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.

23: 

[[Job.15.24|24]] Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.

24: 

[[Job.15.25|25]] For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.

25: 

[[Job.15.26|26]] He runneth upon him, \[even\] on \[his\] neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:

26: 

[[Job.15.27|27]] Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on \[his\] flanks.

27: 

[[Job.15.28|28]] And he dwelleth in desolate cities, \[and\] in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.

28: 

[[Job.15.29|29]] He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.

29: 

[[Job.15.30|30]] He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.

30: 

[[Job.15.31|31]] Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.

31: 

[[Job.15.32|32]] It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.

32: 

[[Job.15.33|33]] He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.

33: 

[[Job.15.34|34]] For the congregation of hypocrites \[shall be\] desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.

34: 

[[Job.15.35|35]] They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.

35:
