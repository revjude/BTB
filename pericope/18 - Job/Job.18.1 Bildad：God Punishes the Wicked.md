[[Job.18|Job 18:1 - Job 18:21]]
*Bildad：God Punishes the Wicked*

[[Job.18.1|1]] Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

1: 

[[Job.18.2|2]] How long \[will it be ere\] ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.

2: 

[[Job.18.3|3]] Wherefore are we counted as beasts, \[and\] reputed vile in your sight?

3: 

[[Job.18.4|4]] He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?

4: 

[[Job.18.5|5]] Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.

5: 

[[Job.18.6|6]] The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.

6: 

[[Job.18.7|7]] The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.

7: 

[[Job.18.8|8]] For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.

8: 

[[Job.18.9|9]] The gin shall take \[him\] by the heel, \[and\] the robber shall prevail against him.

9: 

[[Job.18.10|10]] The snare \[is\] laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.

10: 

[[Job.18.11|11]] Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.

11: 

[[Job.18.12|12]] His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction \[shall be\] ready at his side.

12: 

[[Job.18.13|13]] It shall devour the strength of his skin: \[even\] the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.

13: 

[[Job.18.14|14]] His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.

14: 

[[Job.18.15|15]] It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because \[it is\] none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.

15: 

[[Job.18.16|16]] His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.

16: 

[[Job.18.17|17]] His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.

17: 

[[Job.18.18|18]] He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.

18: 

[[Job.18.19|19]] He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.

19: 

[[Job.18.20|20]] They that come after \[him\] shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.

20: 

[[Job.18.21|21]] Surely such \[are\] the dwellings of the wicked, and this \[is\] the place \[of him that\] knoweth not God.

21:
