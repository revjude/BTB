[[Job.31|Job 31:1 - Job 31:40]]
*Job’s Final Appeal*

[[Job.31.1|1]] I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?

1: 

[[Job.31.2|2]] For what portion of God \[is there\] from above? and \[what\] inheritance of the Almighty from on high?

2: 

[[Job.31.3|3]] \[Is\] not destruction to the wicked? and a strange \[punishment\] to the workers of iniquity?

3: 

[[Job.31.4|4]] Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?

4: 

[[Job.31.5|5]] If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;

5: 

[[Job.31.6|6]] Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity.

6: 

[[Job.31.7|7]] If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;

7: 

[[Job.31.8|8]] \[Then\] let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.

8: 

[[Job.31.9|9]] If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or \[if\] I have laid wait at my neighbour’s door;

9: 

[[Job.31.10|10]] \[Then\] let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.

10: 

[[Job.31.11|11]] For this \[is\] an heinous crime; yea, it \[is\] an iniquity \[to be punished by\] the judges.

11: 

[[Job.31.12|12]] For it \[is\] a fire \[that\] consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.

12: 

[[Job.31.13|13]] If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;

13: 

[[Job.31.14|14]] What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?

14: 

[[Job.31.15|15]] Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?

15: 

[[Job.31.16|16]] If I have withheld the poor from \[their\] desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;

16: 

[[Job.31.17|17]] Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;

17: 

[[Job.31.18|18]] (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as \[with\] a father, and I have guided her from my mother’s womb;)

18: 

[[Job.31.19|19]] If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;

19: 

[[Job.31.20|20]] If his loins have not blessed me, and \[if\] he were \[not\] warmed with the fleece of my sheep;

20: 

[[Job.31.21|21]] If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:

21: 

[[Job.31.22|22]] \[Then\] let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.

22: 

[[Job.31.23|23]] For destruction \[from\] God \[was\] a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.

23: 

[[Job.31.24|24]] If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, \[Thou art\] my confidence;

24: 

[[Job.31.25|25]] If I rejoiced because my wealth \[was\] great, and because mine hand had gotten much;

25: 

[[Job.31.26|26]] If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking \[in\] brightness;

26: 

[[Job.31.27|27]] And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:

27: 

[[Job.31.28|28]] This also \[were\] an iniquity \[to be punished by\] the judge: for I should have denied the God \[that is\] above.

28: 

[[Job.31.29|29]] If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:

29: 

[[Job.31.30|30]] Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.

30: 

[[Job.31.31|31]] If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.

31: 

[[Job.31.32|32]] The stranger did not lodge in the street: \[but\] I opened my doors to the traveller.

32: 

[[Job.31.33|33]] If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:

33: 

[[Job.31.34|34]] Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, \[and\] went not out of the door?

34: 

[[Job.31.35|35]] Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire \[is, that\] the Almighty would answer me, and \[that\] mine adversary had written a book.

35: 

[[Job.31.36|36]] Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, \[and\] bind it \[as\] a crown to me.

36: 

[[Job.31.37|37]] I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.

37: 

[[Job.31.38|38]] If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;

38: 

[[Job.31.39|39]] If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:

39: 

[[Job.31.40|40]] Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
