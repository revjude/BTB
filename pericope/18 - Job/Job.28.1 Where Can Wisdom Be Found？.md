[[Job.28|Job 28:1 - Job 28:28]]
*Where Can Wisdom Be Found？*

[[Job.28.1|1]] Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold \[where\] they fine \[it\].

1: 

[[Job.28.2|2]] Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass \[is\] molten \[out of\] the stone.

2: 

[[Job.28.3|3]] He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.

3: 

[[Job.28.4|4]] The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; \[even the waters\] forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.

4: 

[[Job.28.5|5]] \[As for\] the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.

5: 

[[Job.28.6|6]] The stones of it \[are\] the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.

6: 

[[Job.28.7|7]] \[There is\] a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture’s eye hath not seen:

7: 

[[Job.28.8|8]] The lion’s whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.

8: 

[[Job.28.9|9]] He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.

9: 

[[Job.28.10|10]] He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.

10: 

[[Job.28.11|11]] He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and \[the thing that is\] hid bringeth he forth to light.

11: 

[[Job.28.12|12]] But where shall wisdom be found? and where \[is\] the place of understanding?

12: 

[[Job.28.13|13]] Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.

13: 

[[Job.28.14|14]] The depth saith, It \[is\] not in me: and the sea saith, \[It is\] not with me.

14: 

[[Job.28.15|15]] It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed \[for\] the price thereof.

15: 

[[Job.28.16|16]] It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.

16: 

[[Job.28.17|17]] The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it \[shall not be for\] jewels of fine gold.

17: 

[[Job.28.18|18]] No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom \[is\] above rubies.

18: 

[[Job.28.19|19]] The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.

19: 

[[Job.28.20|20]] Whence then cometh wisdom? and where \[is\] the place of understanding?

20: 

[[Job.28.21|21]] Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.

21: 

[[Job.28.22|22]] Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.

22: 

[[Job.28.23|23]] God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.

23: 

[[Job.28.24|24]] For he looketh to the ends of the earth, \[and\] seeth under the whole heaven;

24: 

[[Job.28.25|25]] To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.

25: 

[[Job.28.26|26]] When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:

26: 

[[Job.28.27|27]] Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.

27: 

[[Job.28.28|28]] And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that \[is\] wisdom; and to depart from evil \[is\] understanding.

28:
