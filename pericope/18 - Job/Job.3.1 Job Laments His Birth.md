[[Job.3|Job 3:1 - Job 3:26]]
*Job Laments His Birth*

[[Job.3.1|1]] After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.

1: 

[[Job.3.2|2]] And Job spake, and said,

2: 

[[Job.3.3|3]] Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night \[in which\] it was said, There is a man child conceived.

3: 

[[Job.3.4|4]] Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.

4: 

[[Job.3.5|5]] Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.

5: 

[[Job.3.6|6]] \[As for\] that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.

6: 

[[Job.3.7|7]] Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.

7: 

[[Job.3.8|8]] Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.

8: 

[[Job.3.9|9]] Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but \[have\] none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:

9: 

[[Job.3.10|10]] Because it shut not up the doors of my \[mother’s\] womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.

10: 

[[Job.3.11|11]] Why died I not from the womb? \[why\] did I \[not\] give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?

11: 

[[Job.3.12|12]] Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?

12: 

[[Job.3.13|13]] For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,

13: 

[[Job.3.14|14]] With kings and counsellers of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;

14: 

[[Job.3.15|15]] Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:

15: 

[[Job.3.16|16]] Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants \[which\] never saw light.

16: 

[[Job.3.17|17]] There the wicked cease \[from\] troubling; and there the weary be at rest.

17: 

[[Job.3.18|18]] \[There\] the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.

18: 

[[Job.3.19|19]] The small and great are there; and the servant \[is\] free from his master.

19: 

[[Job.3.20|20]] Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter \[in\] soul;

20: 

[[Job.3.21|21]] Which long for death, but it \[cometh\] not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;

21: 

[[Job.3.22|22]] Which rejoice exceedingly, \[and\] are glad, when they can find the grave?

22: 

[[Job.3.23|23]] \[Why is light given\] to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?

23: 

[[Job.3.24|24]] For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.

24: 

[[Job.3.25|25]] For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.

25: 

[[Job.3.26|26]] I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.

26:
