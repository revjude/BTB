[[Job.42|Job 42:7 - Job 42:9]]
*The LORD Rebukes Job’s Friends*

[[Job.42.7|7]] And it was \[so\], that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me \[the thing that is\] right, as my servant Job \[hath\].

7: 

[[Job.42.8|8]] Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you \[after your\] folly, in that ye have not spoken of me \[the thing which is\] right, like my servant Job.

8: 

[[Job.42.9|9]] So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite \[and\] Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.

9:
