[[Job.14|Job 14:1 - Job 14:22]]
*Job Laments the Finality of Death*

[[Job.14.1|1]] Man \[that is\] born of a woman \[is\] of few days, and full of trouble.

1: 

[[Job.14.2|2]] He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.

2: 

[[Job.14.3|3]] And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?

3: 

[[Job.14.4|4]] Who can bring a clean \[thing\] out of an unclean? not one.

4: 

[[Job.14.5|5]] Seeing his days \[are\] determined, the number of his months \[are\] with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;

5: 

[[Job.14.6|6]] Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.

6: 

[[Job.14.7|7]] For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.

7: 

[[Job.14.8|8]] Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;

8: 

[[Job.14.9|9]] \[Yet\] through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.

9: 

[[Job.14.10|10]] But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where \[is\] he?

10: 

[[Job.14.11|11]] \[As\] the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:

11: 

[[Job.14.12|12]] So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens \[be\] no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.

12: 

[[Job.14.13|13]] O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!

13: 

[[Job.14.14|14]] If a man die, shall he live \[again\]? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.

14: 

[[Job.14.15|15]] Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.

15: 

[[Job.14.16|16]] For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?

16: 

[[Job.14.17|17]] My transgression \[is\] sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.

17: 

[[Job.14.18|18]] And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.

18: 

[[Job.14.19|19]] The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow \[out\] of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.

19: 

[[Job.14.20|20]] Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.

20: 

[[Job.14.21|21]] His sons come to honour, and he knoweth \[it\] not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth \[it\] not of them.

21: 

[[Job.14.22|22]] But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.

22:
