[[Job.11|Job 11:1 - Job 11:20]]
*Zophar Rebukes Job*

[[Job.11.1|1]] Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,

1: 

[[Job.11.2|2]] Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?

2: 

[[Job.11.3|3]] Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?

3: 

[[Job.11.4|4]] For thou hast said, My doctrine \[is\] pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.

4: 

[[Job.11.5|5]] But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;

5: 

[[Job.11.6|6]] And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that \[they are\] double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee \[less\] than thine iniquity \[deserveth\].

6: 

[[Job.11.7|7]] Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?

7: 

[[Job.11.8|8]] \[It is\] as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?

8: 

[[Job.11.9|9]] The measure thereof \[is\] longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.

9: 

[[Job.11.10|10]] If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?

10: 

[[Job.11.11|11]] For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider \[it\]?

11: 

[[Job.11.12|12]] For vain man would be wise, though man be born \[like\] a wild ass’s colt.

12: 

[[Job.11.13|13]] If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;

13: 

[[Job.11.14|14]] If iniquity \[be\] in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.

14: 

[[Job.11.15|15]] For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:

15: 

[[Job.11.16|16]] Because thou shalt forget \[thy\] misery, \[and\] remember \[it\] as waters \[that\] pass away:

16: 

[[Job.11.17|17]] And \[thine\] age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.

17: 

[[Job.11.18|18]] And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig \[about thee, and\] thou shalt take thy rest in safety.

18: 

[[Job.11.19|19]] Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make \[thee\] afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.

19: 

[[Job.11.20|20]] But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope \[shall be as\] the giving up of the ghost.
