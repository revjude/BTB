[[Job.33|Job 33:1 - Job 33:33]]
*Elihu Rebukes Job*

[[Job.33.1|1]] Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.

1: 

[[Job.33.2|2]] Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.

2: 

[[Job.33.3|3]] My words \[shall be of\] the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.

3: 

[[Job.33.4|4]] The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.

4: 

[[Job.33.5|5]] If thou canst answer me, set \[thy words\] in order before me, stand up.

5: 

[[Job.33.6|6]] Behold, I \[am\] according to thy wish in God’s stead: I also am formed out of the clay.

6: 

[[Job.33.7|7]] Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.

7: 

[[Job.33.8|8]] Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of \[thy\] words, \[saying\],

8: 

[[Job.33.9|9]] I am clean without transgression, I \[am\] innocent; neither \[is there\] iniquity in me.

9: 

[[Job.33.10|10]] Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,

10: 

[[Job.33.11|11]] He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.

11: 

[[Job.33.12|12]] Behold, \[in\] this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.

12: 

[[Job.33.13|13]] Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.

13: 

[[Job.33.14|14]] For God speaketh once, yea twice, \[yet man\] perceiveth it not.

14: 

[[Job.33.15|15]] In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;

15: 

[[Job.33.16|16]] Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,

16: 

[[Job.33.17|17]] That he may withdraw man \[from his\] purpose, and hide pride from man.

17: 

[[Job.33.18|18]] He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.

18: 

[[Job.33.19|19]] He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong \[pain\]:

19: 

[[Job.33.20|20]] So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.

20: 

[[Job.33.21|21]] His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones \[that\] were not seen stick out.

21: 

[[Job.33.22|22]] Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.

22: 

[[Job.33.23|23]] If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:

23: 

[[Job.33.24|24]] Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.

24: 

[[Job.33.25|25]] His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth:

25: 

[[Job.33.26|26]] He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.

26: 

[[Job.33.27|27]] He looketh upon men, and \[if any\] say, I have sinned, and perverted \[that which was\] right, and it profited me not;

27: 

[[Job.33.28|28]] He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.

28: 

[[Job.33.29|29]] Lo, all these \[things\] worketh God oftentimes with man,

29: 

[[Job.33.30|30]] To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.

30: 

[[Job.33.31|31]] Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.

31: 

[[Job.33.32|32]] If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.

32: 

[[Job.33.33|33]] If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.

33:
