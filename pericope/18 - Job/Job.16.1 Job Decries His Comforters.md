[[Job.16|Job 16:1 - Job 16:22]]
*Job Decries His Comforters*

[[Job.16.1|1]] Then Job answered and said,

1: 

[[Job.16.2|2]] I have heard many such things: miserable comforters \[are\] ye all.

2: 

[[Job.16.3|3]] Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?

3: 

[[Job.16.4|4]] I also could speak as ye \[do\]: if your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.

4: 

[[Job.16.5|5]] \[But\] I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage \[your grief\].

5: 

[[Job.16.6|6]] Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and \[though\] I forbear, what am I eased?

6: 

[[Job.16.7|7]] But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.

7: 

[[Job.16.8|8]] And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, \[which\] is a witness \[against me\]: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.

8: 

[[Job.16.9|9]] He teareth \[me\] in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.

9: 

[[Job.16.10|10]] They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.

10: 

[[Job.16.11|11]] God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.

11: 

[[Job.16.12|12]] I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken \[me\] by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.

12: 

[[Job.16.13|13]] His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.

13: 

[[Job.16.14|14]] He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.

14: 

[[Job.16.15|15]] I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.

15: 

[[Job.16.16|16]] My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids \[is\] the shadow of death;

16: 

[[Job.16.17|17]] Not for \[any\] injustice in mine hands: also my prayer \[is\] pure.

17: 

[[Job.16.18|18]] O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.

18: 

[[Job.16.19|19]] Also now, behold, my witness \[is\] in heaven, and my record \[is\] on high.

19: 

[[Job.16.20|20]] My friends scorn me: \[but\] mine eye poureth out \[tears\] unto God.

20: 

[[Job.16.21|21]] O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man \[pleadeth\] for his neighbour!

21: 

[[Job.16.22|22]] When a few years are come, then I shall go the way \[whence\] I shall not return.

22:
