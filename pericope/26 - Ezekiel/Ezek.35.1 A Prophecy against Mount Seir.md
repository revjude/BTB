[[Ezek.35|Ezekiel 35:1 - Ezekiel 35:15]]
*A Prophecy against Mount Seir*

[[Ezek.35.1|1]] Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

1: 

[[Ezek.35.2|2]] Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,

2: 

[[Ezek.35.3|3]] And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I \[am\] against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate.

3: 

[[Ezek.35.4|4]] I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I \[am\] the LORD.

4: 

[[Ezek.35.5|5]] Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed \[the blood of\] the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time \[that their\] iniquity \[had\] an end:

5: 

[[Ezek.35.6|6]] Therefore, \[as\] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee.

6: 

[[Ezek.35.7|7]] Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth.

7: 

[[Ezek.35.8|8]] And I will fill his mountains with his slain \[men\]: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword.

8: 

[[Ezek.35.9|9]] I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

9: 

[[Ezek.35.10|10]] Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there:

10: 

[[Ezek.35.11|11]] Therefore, \[as\] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee.

11: 

[[Ezek.35.12|12]] And thou shalt know that I \[am\] the LORD, \[and that\] I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.

12: 

[[Ezek.35.13|13]] Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard \[them\].

13: 

[[Ezek.35.14|14]] Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.

14: 

[[Ezek.35.15|15]] As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, \[even\] all of it: and they shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

15:
