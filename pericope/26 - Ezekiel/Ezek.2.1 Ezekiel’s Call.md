[[Ezek.2|Ezekiel 2:1 - Ezekiel 2:10]]
*Ezekiel’s Call*

[[Ezek.2.1|1]] And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.

1: 

[[Ezek.2.2|2]] And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.

2: 

[[Ezek.2.3|3]] And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, \[even\] unto this very day.

3: 

[[Ezek.2.4|4]] For \[they are\] impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.

4: 

[[Ezek.2.5|5]] And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they \[are\] a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.

5: 

[[Ezek.2.6|6]] And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns \[be\] with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they \[be\] a rebellious house.

6: 

[[Ezek.2.7|7]] And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they \[are\] most rebellious.

7: 

[[Ezek.2.8|8]] But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.

8: 

[[Ezek.2.9|9]] And when I looked, behold, an hand \[was\] sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book \[was\] therein;

9: 

[[Ezek.2.10|10]] And he spread it before me; and it \[was\] written within and without: and \[there was\] written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.

10:
