[[Ezek.3|Ezekiel 3:16 - Ezekiel 3:27]]
*A Watchman for Israel*

[[Ezek.3.16|16]] And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

16: 

[[Ezek.3.17|17]] Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.

17: 

[[Ezek.3.18|18]] When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked \[man\] shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.

18: 

[[Ezek.3.19|19]] Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.

19: 

[[Ezek.3.20|20]] Again, When a righteous \[man\] doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.

20: 

[[Ezek.3.21|21]] Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous \[man\], that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.

21: 

[[Ezek.3.22|22]] And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.

22: 

[[Ezek.3.23|23]] Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.

23: 

[[Ezek.3.24|24]] Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.

24: 

[[Ezek.3.25|25]] But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:

25: 

[[Ezek.3.26|26]] And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they \[are\] a rebellious house.

26: 

[[Ezek.3.27|27]] But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they \[are\] a rebellious house.

27:
