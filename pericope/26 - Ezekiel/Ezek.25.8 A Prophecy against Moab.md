[[Ezek.25|Ezekiel 25:8 - Ezekiel 25:11]]
*A Prophecy against Moab*

[[Ezek.25.8|8]] Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah \[is\] like unto all the heathen;

8: 

[[Ezek.25.9|9]] Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities \[which are\] on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim,

9: 

[[Ezek.25.10|10]] Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.

10: 

[[Ezek.25.11|11]] And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

11:
