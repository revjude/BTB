[[Ezek.13|Ezekiel 13:17 - Ezekiel 13:23]]
*Reproof of False Prophetesses*

[[Ezek.13.17|17]] Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,

17: 

[[Ezek.13.18|18]] And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the \[women\] that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive \[that come\] unto you?

18: 

[[Ezek.13.19|19]] And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear \[your\] lies?

19: 

[[Ezek.13.20|20]] Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I \[am\] against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make \[them\] fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, \[even\] the souls that ye hunt to make \[them\] fly.

20: 

[[Ezek.13.21|21]] Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

21: 

[[Ezek.13.22|22]] Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:

22: 

[[Ezek.13.23|23]] Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

23:
