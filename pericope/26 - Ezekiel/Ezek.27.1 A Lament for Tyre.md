[[Ezek.27|Ezekiel 27:1 - Ezekiel 27:36]]
*A Lament for Tyre*

[[Ezek.27.1|1]] The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

1: 

[[Ezek.27.2|2]] Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus;

2: 

[[Ezek.27.3|3]] And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, \[which art\] a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I \[am\] of perfect beauty.

3: 

[[Ezek.27.4|4]] Thy borders \[are\] in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty.

4: 

[[Ezek.27.5|5]] They have made all thy \[ship\] boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.

5: 

[[Ezek.27.6|6]] \[Of\] the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches \[of\] ivory, \[brought\] out of the isles of Chittim.

6: 

[[Ezek.27.7|7]] Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee.

7: 

[[Ezek.27.8|8]] The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise \[men\], O Tyrus, \[that\] were in thee, were thy pilots.

8: 

[[Ezek.27.9|9]] The ancients of Gebal and the wise \[men\] thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise.

9: 

[[Ezek.27.10|10]] They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.

10: 

[[Ezek.27.11|11]] The men of Arvad with thine army \[were\] upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect.

11: 

[[Ezek.27.12|12]] Tarshish \[was\] thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all \[kind of\] riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs.

12: 

[[Ezek.27.13|13]] Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they \[were\] thy merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market.

13: 

[[Ezek.27.14|14]] They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules.

14: 

[[Ezek.27.15|15]] The men of Dedan \[were\] thy merchants; many isles \[were\] the merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee \[for\] a present horns of ivory and ebony.

15: 

[[Ezek.27.16|16]] Syria \[was\] thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.

16: 

[[Ezek.27.17|17]] Judah, and the land of Israel, they \[were\] thy merchants: they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.

17: 

[[Ezek.27.18|18]] Damascus \[was\] thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.

18: 

[[Ezek.27.19|19]] Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market.

19: 

[[Ezek.27.20|20]] Dedan \[was\] thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots.

20: 

[[Ezek.27.21|21]] Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these \[were they\] thy merchants.

21: 

[[Ezek.27.22|22]] The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they \[were\] thy merchants: they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.

22: 

[[Ezek.27.23|23]] Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, \[and\] Chilmad, \[were\] thy merchants.

23: 

[[Ezek.27.24|24]] These \[were\] thy merchants in all sorts \[of things\], in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.

24: 

[[Ezek.27.25|25]] The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.

25: 

[[Ezek.27.26|26]] Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.

26: 

[[Ezek.27.27|27]] Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that \[are\] in thee, and in all thy company which \[is\] in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.

27: 

[[Ezek.27.28|28]] The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.

28: 

[[Ezek.27.29|29]] And all that handle the oar, the mariners, \[and\] all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land;

29: 

[[Ezek.27.30|30]] And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:

30: 

[[Ezek.27.31|31]] And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart \[and\] bitter wailing.

31: 

[[Ezek.27.32|32]] And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, \[saying\], What \[city is\] like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?

32: 

[[Ezek.27.33|33]] When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.

33: 

[[Ezek.27.34|34]] In the time \[when\] thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall.

34: 

[[Ezek.27.35|35]] All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in \[their\] countenance.

35: 

[[Ezek.27.36|36]] The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be a terror, and never \[shalt be\] any more.

36:
