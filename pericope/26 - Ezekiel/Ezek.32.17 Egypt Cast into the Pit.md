[[Ezek.32|Ezekiel 32:17 - Ezekiel 32:32]]
*Egypt Cast into the Pit*

[[Ezek.32.17|17]] It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth \[day\] of the month, \[that\] the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

17: 

[[Ezek.32.18|18]] Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, \[even\] her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.

18: 

[[Ezek.32.19|19]] Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.

19: 

[[Ezek.32.20|20]] They shall fall in the midst of \[them that are\] slain by the sword: she is delivered to the sword: draw her and all her multitudes.

20: 

[[Ezek.32.21|21]] The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.

21: 

[[Ezek.32.22|22]] Asshur \[is\] there and all her company: his graves \[are\] about him: all of them slain, fallen by the sword:

22: 

[[Ezek.32.23|23]] Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land of the living.

23: 

[[Ezek.32.24|24]] There \[is\] Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.

24: 

[[Ezek.32.25|25]] They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude: her graves \[are\] round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of \[them that be\] slain.

25: 

[[Ezek.32.26|26]] There \[is\] Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves \[are\] round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living.

26: 

[[Ezek.32.27|27]] And they shall not lie with the mighty \[that are\] fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though \[they were\] the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.

27: 

[[Ezek.32.28|28]] Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with \[them that are\] slain with the sword.

28: 

[[Ezek.32.29|29]] There \[is\] Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their might are laid by \[them that were\] slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.

29: 

[[Ezek.32.30|30]] There \[be\] the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with \[them that be\] slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit.

30: 

[[Ezek.32.31|31]] Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, \[even\] Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.

31: 

[[Ezek.32.32|32]] For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with \[them that are\] slain with the sword, \[even\] Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.

32:
