[[Ezek.41|Ezekiel 41:5 - Ezekiel 41:14]]
*Outside the Temple*

[[Ezek.41.5|5]] After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of \[every\] side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.

5: 

[[Ezek.41.6|6]] And the side chambers \[were\] three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which \[was\] of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.

6: 

[[Ezek.41.7|7]] And \[there was\] an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house \[was still\] upward, and so increased \[from\] the lowest \[chamber\] to the highest by the midst.

7: 

[[Ezek.41.8|8]] I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers \[were\] a full reed of six great cubits.

8: 

[[Ezek.41.9|9]] The thickness of the wall, which \[was\] for the side chamber without, \[was\] five cubits: and \[that\] which \[was\] left \[was\] the place of the side chambers that \[were\] within.

9: 

[[Ezek.41.10|10]] And between the chambers \[was\] the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.

10: 

[[Ezek.41.11|11]] And the doors of the side chambers \[were\] toward \[the place that was\] left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left \[was\] five cubits round about.

11: 

[[Ezek.41.12|12]] Now the building that \[was\] before the separate place at the end toward the west \[was\] seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building \[was\] five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.

12: 

[[Ezek.41.13|13]] So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long;

13: 

[[Ezek.41.14|14]] Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits.

14:
