[[Ezek.12|Ezekiel 12:21 - Ezekiel 12:28]]
*The Presumptuous Proverb*

[[Ezek.12.21|21]] And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

21: 

[[Ezek.12.22|22]] Son of man, what \[is\] that proverb \[that\] ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?

22: 

[[Ezek.12.23|23]] Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.

23: 

[[Ezek.12.24|24]] For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.

24: 

[[Ezek.12.25|25]] For I \[am\] the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord GOD.

25: 

[[Ezek.12.26|26]] Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

26: 

[[Ezek.12.27|27]] Son of man, behold, \[they of\] the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth \[is\] for many days \[to come\], and he prophesieth of the times \[that are\] far off.

27: 

[[Ezek.12.28|28]] Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.

28:
