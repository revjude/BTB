[[Ezek.40|Ezekiel 40:44 - Ezekiel 40:46]]
*Chambers for Ministry*

[[Ezek.40.44|44]] And without the inner gate \[were\] the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which \[was\] at the side of the north gate; and their prospect \[was\] toward the south: one at the side of the east gate \[having\] the prospect toward the north.

44: 

[[Ezek.40.45|45]] And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect \[is\] toward the south, \[is\] for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.

45: 

[[Ezek.40.46|46]] And the chamber whose prospect \[is\] toward the north \[is\] for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these \[are\] the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him.

46:
