[[Ezek.36|Ezekiel 36:1 - Ezekiel 36:15]]
*A Prophecy to the Mountains of Israel*

[[Ezek.36.1|1]] Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD:

1: 

[[Ezek.36.2|2]] Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the enemy hath said against you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession:

2: 

[[Ezek.36.3|3]] Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they have made \[you\] desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and \[are\] an infamy of the people:

3: 

[[Ezek.36.4|4]] Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that \[are\] round about;

4: 

[[Ezek.36.5|5]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all \[their\] heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey.

5: 

[[Ezek.36.6|6]] Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the shame of the heathen:

6: 

[[Ezek.36.7|7]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have lifted up mine hand, Surely the heathen that \[are\] about you, they shall bear their shame.

7: 

[[Ezek.36.8|8]] But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at hand to come.

8: 

[[Ezek.36.9|9]] For, behold, I \[am\] for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown:

9: 

[[Ezek.36.10|10]] And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, \[even\] all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be builded:

10: 

[[Ezek.36.11|11]] And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better \[unto you\] than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

11: 

[[Ezek.36.12|12]] Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, \[even\] my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them \[of men\].

12: 

[[Ezek.36.13|13]] Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, Thou \[land\] devourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations;

13: 

[[Ezek.36.14|14]] Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations any more, saith the Lord GOD.

14: 

[[Ezek.36.15|15]] Neither will I cause \[men\] to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more, saith the Lord GOD.

15:
