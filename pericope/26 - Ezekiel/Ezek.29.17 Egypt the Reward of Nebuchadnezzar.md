[[Ezek.29|Ezekiel 29:17 - Ezekiel 29:21]]
*Egypt the Reward of Nebuchadnezzar*

[[Ezek.29.17|17]] And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first \[month\], in the first \[day\] of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

17: 

[[Ezek.29.18|18]] Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head \[was\] made bald, and every shoulder \[was\] peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it:

18: 

[[Ezek.29.19|19]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.

19: 

[[Ezek.29.20|20]] I have given him the land of Egypt \[for\] his labour wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord GOD.

20: 

[[Ezek.29.21|21]] In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

21:
