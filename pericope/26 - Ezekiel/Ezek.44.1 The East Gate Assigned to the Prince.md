[[Ezek.44|Ezekiel 44:1 - Ezekiel 44:5]]
*The East Gate Assigned to the Prince*

[[Ezek.44.1|1]] Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it \[was\] shut.

1: 

[[Ezek.44.2|2]] Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.

2: 

[[Ezek.44.3|3]] \[It is\] for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of \[that\] gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.

3: 

[[Ezek.44.4|4]] Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD: and I fell upon my face.

4: 

[[Ezek.44.5|5]] And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary.

5:
