[[Ezek.45.7|7]] And \[a portion shall be\] for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy \[portion\], and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy \[portion\], and before the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length \[shall be\] over against one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border.
