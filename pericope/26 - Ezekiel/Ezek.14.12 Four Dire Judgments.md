[[Ezek.14|Ezekiel 14:12 - Ezekiel 14:23]]
*Four Dire Judgments*

[[Ezek.14.12|12]] The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,

12: 

[[Ezek.14.13|13]] Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it:

13: 

[[Ezek.14.14|14]] Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver \[but\] their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord GOD.

14: 

[[Ezek.14.15|15]] If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts:

15: 

[[Ezek.14.16|16]] \[Though\] these three men \[were\] in it, \[as\] I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.

16: 

[[Ezek.14.17|17]] Or \[if\] I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:

17: 

[[Ezek.14.18|18]] Though these three men \[were\] in it, \[as\] I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.

18: 

[[Ezek.14.19|19]] Or \[if\] I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:

19: 

[[Ezek.14.20|20]] Though Noah, Daniel, and Job, \[were\] in it, \[as\] I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall \[but\] deliver their own souls by their righteousness.

20: 

[[Ezek.14.21|21]] For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?

21: 

[[Ezek.14.22|22]] Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, \[both\] sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, \[even\] concerning all that I have brought upon it.

22: 

[[Ezek.14.23|23]] And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.

23:
