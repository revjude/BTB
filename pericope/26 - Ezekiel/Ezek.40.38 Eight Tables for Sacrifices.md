[[Ezek.40|Ezekiel 40:38 - Ezekiel 40:43]]
*Eight Tables for Sacrifices*

[[Ezek.40.38|38]] And the chambers and the entries thereof \[were\] by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.

38: 

[[Ezek.40.39|39]] And in the porch of the gate \[were\] two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering.

39: 

[[Ezek.40.40|40]] And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, \[were\] two tables; and on the other side, which \[was\] at the porch of the gate, \[were\] two tables.

40: 

[[Ezek.40.41|41]] Four tables \[were\] on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew \[their sacrifices\].

41: 

[[Ezek.40.42|42]] And the four tables \[were\] of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.

42: 

[[Ezek.40.43|43]] And within \[were\] hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables \[was\] the flesh of the offering.
