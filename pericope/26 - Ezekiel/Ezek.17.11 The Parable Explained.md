[[Ezek.17|Ezekiel 17:11 - Ezekiel 17:24]]
*The Parable Explained*

[[Ezek.17.11|11]] Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

11: 

[[Ezek.17.12|12]] Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these \[things mean\]? tell \[them\], Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and hath taken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to Babylon;

12: 

[[Ezek.17.13|13]] And hath taken of the king’s seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land:

13: 

[[Ezek.17.14|14]] That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, \[but\] that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.

14: 

[[Ezek.17.15|15]] But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such \[things\]? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?

15: 

[[Ezek.17.16|16]] \[As\] I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place \[where\] the king \[dwelleth\] that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, \[even\] with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.

16: 

[[Ezek.17.17|17]] Neither shall Pharaoh with \[his\] mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:

17: 

[[Ezek.17.18|18]] Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these \[things\], he shall not escape.

18: 

[[Ezek.17.19|19]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; \[As\] I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head.

19: 

[[Ezek.17.20|20]] And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.

20: 

[[Ezek.17.21|21]] And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken \[it\].

21: 

[[Ezek.17.22|22]] Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set \[it\]; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant \[it\] upon an high mountain and eminent:

22: 

[[Ezek.17.23|23]] In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.

23: 

[[Ezek.17.24|24]] And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done \[it\].

24:
