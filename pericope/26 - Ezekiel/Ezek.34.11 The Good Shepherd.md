[[Ezek.34|Ezekiel 34:11 - Ezekiel 34:24]]
*The Good Shepherd*

[[Ezek.34.11|11]] For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, \[even\] I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.

11: 

[[Ezek.34.12|12]] As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep \[that are\] scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.

12: 

[[Ezek.34.13|13]] And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country.

13: 

[[Ezek.34.14|14]] I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and \[in\] a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.

14: 

[[Ezek.34.15|15]] I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord GOD.

15: 

[[Ezek.34.16|16]] I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up \[that which was\] broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.

16: 

[[Ezek.34.17|17]] And \[as for\] you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.

17: 

[[Ezek.34.18|18]] \[Seemeth it\] a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?

18: 

[[Ezek.34.19|19]] And \[as for\] my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.

19: 

[[Ezek.34.20|20]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, \[even\] I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.

20: 

[[Ezek.34.21|21]] Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;

21: 

[[Ezek.34.22|22]] Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.

22: 

[[Ezek.34.23|23]] And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, \[even\] my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.

23: 

[[Ezek.34.24|24]] And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken \[it\].

24:
