[[Ezek.41|Ezekiel 41:15 - Ezekiel 41:26]]
*The Interior Structures*

[[Ezek.41.15|15]] And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which \[was\] behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;

15: 

[[Ezek.41.16|16]] The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows \[were\] covered;

16: 

[[Ezek.41.17|17]] To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.

17: 

[[Ezek.41.18|18]] And \[it was\] made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree \[was\] between a cherub and a cherub; and \[every\] cherub had two faces;

18: 

[[Ezek.41.19|19]] So that the face of a man \[was\] toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: \[it was\] made through all the house round about.

19: 

[[Ezek.41.20|20]] From the ground unto above the door \[were\] cherubims and palm trees made, and \[on\] the wall of the temple.

20: 

[[Ezek.41.21|21]] The posts of the temple \[were\] squared, \[and\] the face of the sanctuary; the appearance \[of the one\] as the appearance \[of the other\].

21: 

[[Ezek.41.22|22]] The altar of wood \[was\] three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, \[were\] of wood: and he said unto me, This \[is\] the table that \[is\] before the LORD.

22: 

[[Ezek.41.23|23]] And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.

23: 

[[Ezek.41.24|24]] And the doors had two leaves \[apiece\], two turning leaves; two \[leaves\] for the one door, and two leaves for the other \[door\].

24: 

[[Ezek.41.25|25]] And \[there were\] made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as \[were\] made upon the walls; and \[there were\] thick planks upon the face of the porch without.

25: 

[[Ezek.41.26|26]] And \[there were\] narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and \[upon\] the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.

26:
