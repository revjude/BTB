[[Ezek.14|Ezekiel 14:1 - Ezekiel 14:11]]
*Idolatrous Elders Condemned*

[[Ezek.14.1|1]] Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me.

1: 

[[Ezek.14.2|2]] And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

2: 

[[Ezek.14.3|3]] Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them?

3: 

[[Ezek.14.4|4]] Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;

4: 

[[Ezek.14.5|5]] That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.

5: 

[[Ezek.14.6|6]] Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn \[yourselves\] from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.

6: 

[[Ezek.14.7|7]] For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to inquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself:

7: 

[[Ezek.14.8|8]] And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

8: 

[[Ezek.14.9|9]] And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.

9: 

[[Ezek.14.10|10]] And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh \[unto him\];

10: 

[[Ezek.14.11|11]] That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD.

11:
