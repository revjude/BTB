[[Ezek.4|Ezekiel 4:9 - Ezekiel 4:17]]
*The Defiled Bread*

[[Ezek.4.9|9]] Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, \[according\] to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.

9: 

[[Ezek.4.10|10]] And thy meat which thou shalt eat \[shall be\] by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.

10: 

[[Ezek.4.11|11]] Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.

11: 

[[Ezek.4.12|12]] And thou shalt eat it \[as\] barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.

12: 

[[Ezek.4.13|13]] And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.

13: 

[[Ezek.4.14|14]] Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.

14: 

[[Ezek.4.15|15]] Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow’s dung for man’s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.

15: 

[[Ezek.4.16|16]] Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:

16: 

[[Ezek.4.17|17]] That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.

17:
