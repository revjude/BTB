*The North Gate*

[[Ezek.40.20|20]] And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.

20: 

[[Ezek.40.21|21]] And the little chambers thereof \[were\] three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof \[was\] fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.

21: 

[[Ezek.40.22|22]] And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, \[were\] after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof \[were\] before them.

22: 

[[Ezek.40.23|23]] And the gate of the inner court \[was\] over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits.
