[[Ezek.33|Ezekiel 33:10 - Ezekiel 33:20]]
*The Message of the Watchman*

[[Ezek.33.10|10]] Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins \[be\] upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?

10: 

[[Ezek.33.11|11]] Say unto them, \[As\] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?

11: 

[[Ezek.33.12|12]] Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his \[righteousness\] in the day that he sinneth.

12: 

[[Ezek.33.13|13]] When I shall say to the righteous, \[that\] he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it.

13: 

[[Ezek.33.14|14]] Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;

14: 

[[Ezek.33.15|15]] \[If\] the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.

15: 

[[Ezek.33.16|16]] None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.

16: 

[[Ezek.33.17|17]] Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.

17: 

[[Ezek.33.18|18]] When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby.

18: 

[[Ezek.33.19|19]] But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.

19: 

[[Ezek.33.20|20]] Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.
