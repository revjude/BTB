[[Ezek.40|Ezekiel 40:17 - Ezekiel 40:19]]
*The Outer Court*

[[Ezek.40.17|17]] Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, \[there were\] chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers \[were\] upon the pavement.

17: 

[[Ezek.40.18|18]] And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates \[was\] the lower pavement.

18: 

[[Ezek.40.19|19]] Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward.
