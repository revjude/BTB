[[Ezek.32|Ezekiel 32:1 - Ezekiel 32:16]]
*A Lament for Pharaoh King of Egypt*

[[Ezek.32.1|1]] And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first \[day\] of the month, \[that\] the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

1: 

[[Ezek.32.2|2]] Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou \[art\] as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers.

2: 

[[Ezek.32.3|3]] Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my net.

3: 

[[Ezek.32.4|4]] Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.

4: 

[[Ezek.32.5|5]] And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height.

5: 

[[Ezek.32.6|6]] I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, \[even\] to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee.

6: 

[[Ezek.32.7|7]] And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.

7: 

[[Ezek.32.8|8]] All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD.

8: 

[[Ezek.32.9|9]] I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.

9: 

[[Ezek.32.10|10]] Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at \[every\] moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.

10: 

[[Ezek.32.11|11]] For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.

11: 

[[Ezek.32.12|12]] By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.

12: 

[[Ezek.32.13|13]] I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.

13: 

[[Ezek.32.14|14]] Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord GOD.

14: 

[[Ezek.32.15|15]] When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I \[am\] the LORD.

15: 

[[Ezek.32.16|16]] This \[is\] the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for her, \[even\] for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the Lord GOD.

16:
