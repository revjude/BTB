[[Ezek.7|Ezekiel 7:1 - Ezekiel 7:13]]
*The Hour of Doom*

[[Ezek.7.1|1]] Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

1: 

[[Ezek.7.2|2]] Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.

2: 

[[Ezek.7.3|3]] Now \[is\] the end \[come\] upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.

3: 

[[Ezek.7.4|4]] And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

4: 

[[Ezek.7.5|5]] Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.

5: 

[[Ezek.7.6|6]] An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.

6: 

[[Ezek.7.7|7]] The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble \[is\] near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.

7: 

[[Ezek.7.8|8]] Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.

8: 

[[Ezek.7.9|9]] And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations \[that\] are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I \[am\] the LORD that smiteth.

9: 

[[Ezek.7.10|10]] Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.

10: 

[[Ezek.7.11|11]] Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them \[shall remain\], nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither \[shall there be\] wailing for them.

11: 

[[Ezek.7.12|12]] The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath \[is\] upon all the multitude thereof.

12: 

[[Ezek.7.13|13]] For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision \[is\] touching the whole multitude thereof, \[which\] shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.

13:
