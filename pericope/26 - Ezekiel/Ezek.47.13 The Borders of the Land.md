[[Ezek.47|Ezekiel 47:13 - Ezekiel 47:23]]
*The Borders of the Land*

[[Ezek.47.13|13]] Thus saith the Lord GOD; This \[shall be\] the border, whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph \[shall have two\] portions.

13: 

[[Ezek.47.14|14]] And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: \[concerning\] the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.

14: 

[[Ezek.47.15|15]] And this \[shall be\] the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad;

15: 

[[Ezek.47.16|16]] Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which \[is\] between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which \[is\] by the coast of Hauran.

16: 

[[Ezek.47.17|17]] And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And \[this is\] the north side.

17: 

[[Ezek.47.18|18]] And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel \[by\] Jordan, from the border unto the east sea. And \[this is\] the east side.

18: 

[[Ezek.47.19|19]] And the south side southward, from Tamar \[even\] to the waters of strife \[in\] Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And \[this is\] the south side southward.

19: 

[[Ezek.47.20|20]] The west side also \[shall be\] the great sea from the border, till a man come over against Hamath. This \[is\] the west side.

20: 

[[Ezek.47.21|21]] So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.

21: 

[[Ezek.47.22|22]] And it shall come to pass, \[that\] ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children among you: and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.

22: 

[[Ezek.47.23|23]] And it shall come to pass, \[that\] in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give \[him\] his inheritance, saith the Lord GOD.

23:
