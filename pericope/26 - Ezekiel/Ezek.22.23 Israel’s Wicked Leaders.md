[[Ezek.22|Ezekiel 22:23 - Ezekiel 22:31]]
*Israel’s Wicked Leaders*

[[Ezek.22.23|23]] And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

23: 

[[Ezek.22.24|24]] Son of man, say unto her, Thou \[art\] the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.

24: 

[[Ezek.22.25|25]] \[There is\] a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.

25: 

[[Ezek.22.26|26]] Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed \[difference\] between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.

26: 

[[Ezek.22.27|27]] Her princes in the midst thereof \[are\] like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, \[and\] to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.

27: 

[[Ezek.22.28|28]] And her prophets have daubed them with untempered \[morter\], seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.

28: 

[[Ezek.22.29|29]] The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.

29: 

[[Ezek.22.30|30]] And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.

30: 

[[Ezek.22.31|31]] Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.

31:
