[[Ezek.44|Ezekiel 44:15 - Ezekiel 44:31]]
*The Duties of the Priests*

[[Ezek.44.15|15]] But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord GOD:

15: 

[[Ezek.44.16|16]] They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.

16: 

[[Ezek.44.17|17]] And it shall come to pass, \[that\] when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.

17: 

[[Ezek.44.18|18]] They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird \[themselves\] with any thing that causeth sweat.

18: 

[[Ezek.44.19|19]] And when they go forth into the utter court, \[even\] into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.

19: 

[[Ezek.44.20|20]] Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.

20: 

[[Ezek.44.21|21]] Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.

21: 

[[Ezek.44.22|22]] Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.

22: 

[[Ezek.44.23|23]] And they shall teach my people \[the difference\] between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.

23: 

[[Ezek.44.24|24]] And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; \[and\] they shall judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.

24: 

[[Ezek.44.25|25]] And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.

25: 

[[Ezek.44.26|26]] And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.

26: 

[[Ezek.44.27|27]] And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, saith the Lord GOD.

27: 

[[Ezek.44.28|28]] And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I \[am\] their inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I \[am\] their possession.

28: 

[[Ezek.44.29|29]] They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.

29: 

[[Ezek.44.30|30]] And the first of all the firstfruits of all \[things\], and every oblation of all, of every \[sort\] of your oblations, shall be the priest’s: ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house.

30: 

[[Ezek.44.31|31]] The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.
