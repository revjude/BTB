[[Ezek.40|Ezekiel 40:5 - Ezekiel 40:16]]
*The East Gate*

[[Ezek.40.5|5]] And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed of six cubits \[long\] by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.

5: 

[[Ezek.40.6|6]] Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, \[which was\] one reed broad; and the other threshold \[of the gate, which was\] one reed broad.

6: 

[[Ezek.40.7|7]] And \[every\] little chamber \[was\] one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers \[were\] five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within \[was\] one reed.

7: 

[[Ezek.40.8|8]] He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.

8: 

[[Ezek.40.9|9]] Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate \[was\] inward.

9: 

[[Ezek.40.10|10]] And the little chambers of the gate eastward \[were\] three on this side, and three on that side; they three \[were\] of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.

10: 

[[Ezek.40.11|11]] And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; \[and\] the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.

11: 

[[Ezek.40.12|12]] The space also before the little chambers \[was\] one cubit \[on this side\], and the space \[was\] one cubit on that side: and the little chambers \[were\] six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.

12: 

[[Ezek.40.13|13]] He measured then the gate from the roof of \[one\] little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth \[was\] five and twenty cubits, door against door.

13: 

[[Ezek.40.14|14]] He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate.

14: 

[[Ezek.40.15|15]] And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate \[were\] fifty cubits.

15: 

[[Ezek.40.16|16]] And \[there were\] narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows \[were\] round about inward: and upon \[each\] post \[were\] palm trees.

16:
