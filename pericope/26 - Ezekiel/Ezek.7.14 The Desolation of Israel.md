[[Ezek.7|Ezekiel 7:14 - Ezekiel 7:27]]
*The Desolation of Israel*

[[Ezek.7.14|14]] They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath \[is\] upon all the multitude thereof.

14: 

[[Ezek.7.15|15]] The sword \[is\] without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that \[is\] in the field shall die with the sword; and he that \[is\] in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.

15: 

[[Ezek.7.16|16]] But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.

16: 

[[Ezek.7.17|17]] All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak \[as\] water.

17: 

[[Ezek.7.18|18]] They shall also gird \[themselves\] with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame \[shall be\] upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.

18: 

[[Ezek.7.19|19]] They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.

19: 

[[Ezek.7.20|20]] As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations \[and\] of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.

20: 

[[Ezek.7.21|21]] And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.

21: 

[[Ezek.7.22|22]] My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret \[place\]: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.

22: 

[[Ezek.7.23|23]] Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.

23: 

[[Ezek.7.24|24]] Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.

24: 

[[Ezek.7.25|25]] Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and \[there shall be\] none.

25: 

[[Ezek.7.26|26]] Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.

26: 

[[Ezek.7.27|27]] The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

27:
