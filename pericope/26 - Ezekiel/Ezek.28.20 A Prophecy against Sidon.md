[[Ezek.28|Ezekiel 28:20 - Ezekiel 28:24]]
*A Prophecy against Sidon*

[[Ezek.28.20|20]] Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

20: 

[[Ezek.28.21|21]] Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it,

21: 

[[Ezek.28.22|22]] And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I \[am\] against thee, O Zidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I \[am\] the LORD, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.

22: 

[[Ezek.28.23|23]] For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

23: 

[[Ezek.28.24|24]] And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor \[any\] grieving thorn of all \[that are\] round about them, that despised them; and they shall know that I \[am\] the Lord GOD.

24:
