[[Ezek.5|Ezekiel 5:11 - Ezekiel 5:17]]
*Famine, Sword, and Dispersion*

[[Ezek.5.11|11]] Wherefore, \[as\] I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish \[thee\]; neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity.

11: 

[[Ezek.5.12|12]] A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.

12: 

[[Ezek.5.13|13]] Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken \[it\] in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.

13: 

[[Ezek.5.14|14]] Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that \[are\] round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.

14: 

[[Ezek.5.15|15]] So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that \[are\] round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken \[it\].

15: 

[[Ezek.5.16|16]] When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for \[their\] destruction, \[and\] which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread:

16: 

[[Ezek.5.17|17]] So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken \[it\].

17:
