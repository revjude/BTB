[[Ezek.16|Ezekiel 16:1 - Ezekiel 16:34]]
*Jerusalem’s Unfaithfulness*

[[Ezek.16.1|1]] Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

1: 

[[Ezek.16.2|2]] Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,

2: 

[[Ezek.16.3|3]] And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity \[is\] of the land of Canaan; thy father \[was\] an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite.

3: 

[[Ezek.16.4|4]] And \[as for\] thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple \[thee\]; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.

4: 

[[Ezek.16.5|5]] None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.

5: 

[[Ezek.16.6|6]] And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee \[when thou wast\] in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee \[when thou wast\] in thy blood, Live.

6: 

[[Ezek.16.7|7]] I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: \[thy\] breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas thou \[wast\] naked and bare.

7: 

[[Ezek.16.8|8]] Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time \[was\] the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine.

8: 

[[Ezek.16.9|9]] Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.

9: 

[[Ezek.16.10|10]] I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers’ skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.

10: 

[[Ezek.16.11|11]] I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.

11: 

[[Ezek.16.12|12]] And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head.

12: 

[[Ezek.16.13|13]] Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment \[was of\] fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.

13: 

[[Ezek.16.14|14]] And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it \[was\] perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD.

14: 

[[Ezek.16.15|15]] But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.

15: 

[[Ezek.16.16|16]] And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: \[the like things\] shall not come, neither shall it be \[so\].

16: 

[[Ezek.16.17|17]] Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them,

17: 

[[Ezek.16.18|18]] And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.

18: 

[[Ezek.16.19|19]] My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, \[wherewith\] I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour: and \[thus\] it was, saith the Lord GOD.

19: 

[[Ezek.16.20|20]] Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. \[Is this\] of thy whoredoms a small matter,

20: 

[[Ezek.16.21|21]] That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through \[the fire\] for them?

21: 

[[Ezek.16.22|22]] And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, \[and\] wast polluted in thy blood.

22: 

[[Ezek.16.23|23]] And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord GOD;)

23: 

[[Ezek.16.24|24]] \[That\] thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee an high place in every street.

24: 

[[Ezek.16.25|25]] Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.

25: 

[[Ezek.16.26|26]] Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.

26: 

[[Ezek.16.27|27]] Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary \[food\], and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way.

27: 

[[Ezek.16.28|28]] Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.

28: 

[[Ezek.16.29|29]] Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.

29: 

[[Ezek.16.30|30]] How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord GOD, seeing thou doest all these \[things\], the work of an imperious whorish woman;

30: 

[[Ezek.16.31|31]] In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire;

31: 

[[Ezek.16.32|32]] \[But as\] a wife that committeth adultery, \[which\] taketh strangers instead of her husband!

32: 

[[Ezek.16.33|33]] They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom.

33: 

[[Ezek.16.34|34]] And the contrary is in thee from \[other\] women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art contrary.

34:
