[[Ezek.40.48|48]] And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured \[each\] post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate \[was\] three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.

48: 

[[Ezek.40.49|49]] The length of the porch \[was\] twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and \[he brought me\] by the steps whereby they went up to it: and \[there were\] pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.
