[[Ezek.20|Ezekiel 20:1 - Ezekiel 20:9]]
*Israel’s Rebellion in Egypt*

[[Ezek.20.1|1]] And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth \[month\], the tenth \[day\] of the month, \[that\] certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and sat before me.

1: 

[[Ezek.20.2|2]] Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,

2: 

[[Ezek.20.3|3]] Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye come to inquire of me? \[As\] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.

3: 

[[Ezek.20.4|4]] Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge \[them\]? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:

4: 

[[Ezek.20.5|5]] And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I \[am\] the LORD your God;

5: 

[[Ezek.20.6|6]] In the day \[that\] I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which \[is\] the glory of all lands:

6: 

[[Ezek.20.7|7]] Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I \[am\] the LORD your God.

7: 

[[Ezek.20.8|8]] But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.

8: 

[[Ezek.20.9|9]] But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they \[were\], in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.

9:
