[[Ezek.42|Ezekiel 42:1 - Ezekiel 42:14]]
*Chambers for the Priests*

[[Ezek.42.1|1]] Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that \[was\] over against the separate place, and which \[was\] before the building toward the north.

1: 

[[Ezek.42.2|2]] Before the length of an hundred cubits \[was\] the north door, and the breadth \[was\] fifty cubits.

2: 

[[Ezek.42.3|3]] Over against the twenty \[cubits\] which \[were\] for the inner court, and over against the pavement which \[was\] for the utter court, \[was\] gallery against gallery in three \[stories\].

3: 

[[Ezek.42.4|4]] And before the chambers \[was\] a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.

4: 

[[Ezek.42.5|5]] Now the upper chambers \[were\] shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.

5: 

[[Ezek.42.6|6]] For they \[were\] in three \[stories\], but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore \[the building\] was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.

6: 

[[Ezek.42.7|7]] And the wall that \[was\] without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof \[was\] fifty cubits.

7: 

[[Ezek.42.8|8]] For the length of the chambers that \[were\] in the utter court \[was\] fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple \[were\] an hundred cubits.

8: 

[[Ezek.42.9|9]] And from under these chambers \[was\] the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court.

9: 

[[Ezek.42.10|10]] The chambers \[were\] in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.

10: 

[[Ezek.42.11|11]] And the way before them \[was\] like the appearance of the chambers which \[were\] toward the north, as long as they, \[and\] as broad as they: and all their goings out \[were\] both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.

11: 

[[Ezek.42.12|12]] And according to the doors of the chambers that \[were\] toward the south \[was\] a door in the head of the way, \[even\] the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.

12: 

[[Ezek.42.13|13]] Then said he unto me, The north chambers \[and\] the south chambers, which \[are\] before the separate place, they \[be\] holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place \[is\] holy.

13: 

[[Ezek.42.14|14]] When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy \[place\] into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they \[are\] holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to \[those things\] which \[are\] for the people.

14:
