[[Ezek.43|Ezekiel 43:1 - Ezekiel 43:12]]
*The Glory of the LORD Returns to the Temple*

[[Ezek.43.1|1]] Afterward he brought me to the gate, \[even\] the gate that looketh toward the east:

1: 

[[Ezek.43.2|2]] And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice \[was\] like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.

2: 

[[Ezek.43.3|3]] And \[it was\] according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, \[even\] according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions \[were\] like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.

3: 

[[Ezek.43.4|4]] And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect \[is\] toward the east.

4: 

[[Ezek.43.5|5]] So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.

5: 

[[Ezek.43.6|6]] And I heard \[him\] speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me.

6: 

[[Ezek.43.7|7]] And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, \[neither\] they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places.

7: 

[[Ezek.43.8|8]] In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.

8: 

[[Ezek.43.9|9]] Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.

9: 

[[Ezek.43.10|10]] Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.

10: 

[[Ezek.43.11|11]] And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write \[it\] in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.

11: 

[[Ezek.43.12|12]] This \[is\] the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about \[shall be\] most holy. Behold, this \[is\] the law of the house.

12:
