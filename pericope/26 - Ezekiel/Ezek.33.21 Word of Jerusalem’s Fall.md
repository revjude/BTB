[[Ezek.33|Ezekiel 33:21 - Ezekiel 33:33]]
*Word of Jerusalem’s Fall*

[[Ezek.33.21|21]] And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth \[month\], in the fifth \[day\] of the month, \[that\] one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.

21: 

[[Ezek.33.22|22]] Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.

22: 

[[Ezek.33.23|23]] Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

23: 

[[Ezek.33.24|24]] Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we \[are\] many; the land is given us for inheritance.

24: 

[[Ezek.33.25|25]] Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land?

25: 

[[Ezek.33.26|26]] Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour’s wife: and shall ye possess the land?

26: 

[[Ezek.33.27|27]] Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; \[As\] I live, surely they that \[are\] in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that \[is\] in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that \[be\] in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.

27: 

[[Ezek.33.28|28]] For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through.

28: 

[[Ezek.33.29|29]] Then shall they know that I \[am\] the LORD, when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.

29: 

[[Ezek.33.30|30]] Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD.

30: 

[[Ezek.33.31|31]] And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee \[as\] my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, \[but\] their heart goeth after their covetousness.

31: 

[[Ezek.33.32|32]] And, lo, thou \[art\] unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not.

32: 

[[Ezek.33.33|33]] And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.

33:
