[[Ezek.1|Ezekiel 1:4 - Ezekiel 1:14]]
*The Four Living Creatures*

[[Ezek.1.4|4]] And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness \[was\] about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.

4: 

[[Ezek.1.5|5]] Also out of the midst thereof \[came\] the likeness of four living creatures. And this \[was\] their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.

5: 

[[Ezek.1.6|6]] And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.

6: 

[[Ezek.1.7|7]] And their feet \[were\] straight feet; and the sole of their feet \[was\] like the sole of a calf’s foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.

7: 

[[Ezek.1.8|8]] And \[they had\] the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.

8: 

[[Ezek.1.9|9]] Their wings \[were\] joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.

9: 

[[Ezek.1.10|10]] As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.

10: 

[[Ezek.1.11|11]] Thus \[were\] their faces: and their wings \[were\] stretched upward; two \[wings\] of every one \[were\] joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.

11: 

[[Ezek.1.12|12]] And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; \[and\] they turned not when they went.

12: 

[[Ezek.1.13|13]] As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance \[was\] like burning coals of fire, \[and\] like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.

13: 

[[Ezek.1.14|14]] And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.

14:
