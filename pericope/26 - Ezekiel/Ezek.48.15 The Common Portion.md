17: 

[[Ezek.48.18|18]] And the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy \[portion shall be\] ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward: and it shall be over against the oblation of the holy \[portion\]; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that serve the city.
