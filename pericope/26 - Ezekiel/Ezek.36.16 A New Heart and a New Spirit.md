[[Ezek.36|Ezekiel 36:16 - Ezekiel 36:38]]
*A New Heart and a New Spirit*

[[Ezek.36.16|16]] Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

16: 

[[Ezek.36.17|17]] Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.

17: 

[[Ezek.36.18|18]] Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols \[wherewith\] they had polluted it:

18: 

[[Ezek.36.19|19]] And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.

19: 

[[Ezek.36.20|20]] And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These \[are\] the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.

20: 

[[Ezek.36.21|21]] But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.

21: 

[[Ezek.36.22|22]] Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not \[this\] for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name’s sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went.

22: 

[[Ezek.36.23|23]] And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I \[am\] the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.

23: 

[[Ezek.36.24|24]] For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.

24: 

[[Ezek.36.25|25]] Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.

25: 

[[Ezek.36.26|26]] A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.

26: 

[[Ezek.36.27|27]] And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do \[them\].

27: 

[[Ezek.36.28|28]] And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.

28: 

[[Ezek.36.29|29]] I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.

29: 

[[Ezek.36.30|30]] And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen.

30: 

[[Ezek.36.31|31]] Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that \[were\] not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.

31: 

[[Ezek.36.32|32]] Not for your sakes do I \[this\], saith the Lord GOD, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel.

32: 

[[Ezek.36.33|33]] Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause \[you\] to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded.

33: 

[[Ezek.36.34|34]] And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by.

34: 

[[Ezek.36.35|35]] And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities \[are become\] fenced, \[and\] are inhabited.

35: 

[[Ezek.36.36|36]] Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined \[places, and\] plant that that was desolate: I the LORD have spoken \[it\], and I will do \[it\].

36: 

[[Ezek.36.37|37]] Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet \[for\] this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do \[it\] for them; I will increase them with men like a flock.

37: 

[[Ezek.36.38|38]] As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

38:
