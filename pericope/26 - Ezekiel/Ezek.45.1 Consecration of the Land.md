[[Ezek.45|Ezekiel 45:1 - Ezekiel 45:6]]
*Consecration of the Land*

[[Ezek.45.1|1]] Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy portion of the land: the length \[shall be\] the length of five and twenty thousand \[reeds\], and the breadth \[shall be\] ten thousand. This \[shall be\] holy in all the borders thereof round about.

1: 

[[Ezek.45.2|2]] Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred \[in length\], with five hundred \[in breadth\], square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof.

2: 

[[Ezek.45.3|3]] And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary \[and\] the most holy \[place\].

3: 

[[Ezek.45.4|4]] The holy \[portion\] of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister unto the LORD: and it shall be a place for their houses, and an holy place for the sanctuary.

4: 

[[Ezek.45.5|5]] And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth, shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers.

5: 

[[Ezek.45.6|6]] And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy \[portion\]: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.

6:
