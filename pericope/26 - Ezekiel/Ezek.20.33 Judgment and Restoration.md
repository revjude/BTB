[[Ezek.20|Ezekiel 20:33 - Ezekiel 20:44]]
*Judgment and Restoration*

[[Ezek.20.33|33]] \[As\] I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:

33: 

[[Ezek.20.34|34]] And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.

34: 

[[Ezek.20.35|35]] And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face.

35: 

[[Ezek.20.36|36]] Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.

36: 

[[Ezek.20.37|37]] And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:

37: 

[[Ezek.20.38|38]] And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

38: 

[[Ezek.20.39|39]] As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter \[also\], if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.

39: 

[[Ezek.20.40|40]] For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.

40: 

[[Ezek.20.41|41]] I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.

41: 

[[Ezek.20.42|42]] And ye shall know that I \[am\] the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country \[for\] the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers.

42: 

[[Ezek.20.43|43]] And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.

43: 

[[Ezek.20.44|44]] And ye shall know that I \[am\] the LORD, when I have wrought with you for my name’s sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.

44:
