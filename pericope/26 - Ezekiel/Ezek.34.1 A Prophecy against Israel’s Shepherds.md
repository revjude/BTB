[[Ezek.34|Ezekiel 34:1 - Ezekiel 34:10]]
*A Prophecy against Israel’s Shepherds*

[[Ezek.34.1|1]] And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

1: 

[[Ezek.34.2|2]] Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe \[be\] to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?

2: 

[[Ezek.34.3|3]] Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: \[but\] ye feed not the flock.

3: 

[[Ezek.34.4|4]] The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up \[that which was\] broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.

4: 

[[Ezek.34.5|5]] And they were scattered, because \[there is\] no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.

5: 

[[Ezek.34.6|6]] My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek \[after them\].

6: 

[[Ezek.34.7|7]] Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;

7: 

[[Ezek.34.8|8]] \[As\] I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because \[there was\] no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock;

8: 

[[Ezek.34.9|9]] Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;

9: 

[[Ezek.34.10|10]] Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I \[am\] against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.

10:
