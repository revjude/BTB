[[Ezek.24|Ezekiel 24:15 - Ezekiel 24:27]]
*Ezekiel’s Wife Dies*

[[Ezek.24.15|15]] Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

15: 

[[Ezek.24.16|16]] Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.

16: 

[[Ezek.24.17|17]] Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not \[thy\] lips, and eat not the bread of men.

17: 

[[Ezek.24.18|18]] So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.

18: 

[[Ezek.24.19|19]] And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these \[things are\] to us, that thou doest \[so\]?

19: 

[[Ezek.24.20|20]] Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

20: 

[[Ezek.24.21|21]] Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword.

21: 

[[Ezek.24.22|22]] And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover \[your\] lips, nor eat the bread of men.

22: 

[[Ezek.24.23|23]] And your tires \[shall be\] upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.

23: 

[[Ezek.24.24|24]] Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I \[am\] the Lord GOD.

24: 

[[Ezek.24.25|25]] Also, thou son of man, \[shall it\] not \[be\] in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,

25: 

[[Ezek.24.26|26]] \[That\] he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause \[thee\] to hear \[it\] with \[thine\] ears?

26: 

[[Ezek.24.27|27]] In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

27:
