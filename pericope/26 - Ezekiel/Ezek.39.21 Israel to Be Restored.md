[[Ezek.39|Ezekiel 39:21 - Ezekiel 39:29]]
*Israel to Be Restored*

[[Ezek.39.21|21]] And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.

21: 

[[Ezek.39.22|22]] So the house of Israel shall know that I \[am\] the LORD their God from that day and forward.

22: 

[[Ezek.39.23|23]] And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword.

23: 

[[Ezek.39.24|24]] According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them.

24: 

[[Ezek.39.25|25]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name;

25: 

[[Ezek.39.26|26]] After that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made \[them\] afraid.

26: 

[[Ezek.39.27|27]] When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;

27: 

[[Ezek.39.28|28]] Then shall they know that I \[am\] the LORD their God, which caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them any more there.

28: 

[[Ezek.39.29|29]] Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.

29:
