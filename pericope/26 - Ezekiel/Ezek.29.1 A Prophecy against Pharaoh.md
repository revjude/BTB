[[Ezek.29|Ezekiel 29:1 - Ezekiel 29:7]]
*A Prophecy against Pharaoh*

[[Ezek.29.1|1]] In the tenth year, in the tenth \[month\], in the twelfth \[day\] of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

1: 

[[Ezek.29.2|2]] Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt:

2: 

[[Ezek.29.3|3]] Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I \[am\] against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river \[is\] mine own, and I have made \[it\] for myself.

3: 

[[Ezek.29.4|4]] But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales.

4: 

[[Ezek.29.5|5]] And I will leave thee \[thrown\] into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven.

5: 

[[Ezek.29.6|6]] And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I \[am\] the LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.

6: 

[[Ezek.29.7|7]] When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.

7:
