[[Ezek.40|Ezekiel 40:1 - Ezekiel 40:4]]
*The Man with a Measuring Rod*

[[Ezek.40.1|1]] In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth \[day\] of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me thither.

1: 

[[Ezek.40.2|2]] In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which \[was\] as the frame of a city on the south.

2: 

[[Ezek.40.3|3]] And he brought me thither, and, behold, \[there was\] a man, whose appearance \[was\] like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.

3: 

[[Ezek.40.4|4]] And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew \[them\] unto thee \[art\] thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.
