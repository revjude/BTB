[[Ezek.28|Ezekiel 28:1 - Ezekiel 28:10]]
*A Prophecy against the Ruler of Tyre*

[[Ezek.28.1|1]] The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

1: 

[[Ezek.28.2|2]] Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thine heart \[is\] lifted up, and thou hast said, I \[am\] a God, I sit \[in\] the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou \[art\] a man, and not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God:

2: 

[[Ezek.28.3|3]] Behold, thou \[art\] wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee:

3: 

[[Ezek.28.4|4]] With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures:

4: 

[[Ezek.28.5|5]] By thy great wisdom \[and\] by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches:

5: 

[[Ezek.28.6|6]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God;

6: 

[[Ezek.28.7|7]] Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.

7: 

[[Ezek.28.8|8]] They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths of \[them that are\] slain in the midst of the seas.

8: 

[[Ezek.28.9|9]] Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I \[am\] God? but thou \[shalt be\] a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee.

9: 

[[Ezek.28.10|10]] Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken \[it\], saith the Lord GOD.

10:
