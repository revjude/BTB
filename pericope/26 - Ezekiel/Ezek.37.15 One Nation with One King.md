[[Ezek.37|Ezekiel 37:15 - Ezekiel 37:28]]
*One Nation with One King*

[[Ezek.37.15|15]] The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

15: 

[[Ezek.37.16|16]] Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and \[for\] all the house of Israel his companions:

16: 

[[Ezek.37.17|17]] And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.

17: 

[[Ezek.37.18|18]] And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou \[meanest\] by these?

18: 

[[Ezek.37.19|19]] Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which \[is\] in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, \[even\] with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.

19: 

[[Ezek.37.20|20]] And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes.

20: 

[[Ezek.37.21|21]] And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:

21: 

[[Ezek.37.22|22]] And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:

22: 

[[Ezek.37.23|23]] Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.

23: 

[[Ezek.37.24|24]] And David my servant \[shall be\] king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.

24: 

[[Ezek.37.25|25]] And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, \[even\] they, and their children, and their children’s children for ever: and my servant David \[shall be\] their prince for ever.

25: 

[[Ezek.37.26|26]] Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.

26: 

[[Ezek.37.27|27]] My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

27: 

[[Ezek.37.28|28]] And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.

28:
