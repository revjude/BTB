[[Ezek.15|Ezekiel 15:1 - Ezekiel 15:8]]
*Jerusalem the Useless Vine*

[[Ezek.15.1|1]] And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

1: 

[[Ezek.15.2|2]] Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, \[or than\] a branch which is among the trees of the forest?

2: 

[[Ezek.15.3|3]] Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will \[men\] take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?

3: 

[[Ezek.15.4|4]] Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for \[any\] work?

4: 

[[Ezek.15.5|5]] Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for \[any\] work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned?

5: 

[[Ezek.15.6|6]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

6: 

[[Ezek.15.7|7]] And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from \[one\] fire, and \[another\] fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I \[am\] the LORD, when I set my face against them.

7: 

[[Ezek.15.8|8]] And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.

8:
