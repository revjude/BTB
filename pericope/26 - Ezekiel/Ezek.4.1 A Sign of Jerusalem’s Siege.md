[[Ezek.4|Ezekiel 4:1 - Ezekiel 4:8]]
*A Sign of Jerusalem’s Siege*

[[Ezek.4.1|1]] Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it the city, \[even\] Jerusalem:

1: 

[[Ezek.4.2|2]] And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set \[battering\] rams against it round about.

2: 

[[Ezek.4.3|3]] Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it \[for\] a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This \[shall be\] a sign to the house of Israel.

3: 

[[Ezek.4.4|4]] Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: \[according\] to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.

4: 

[[Ezek.4.5|5]] For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.

5: 

[[Ezek.4.6|6]] And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.

6: 

[[Ezek.4.7|7]] Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm \[shall be\] uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.

7: 

[[Ezek.4.8|8]] And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.

8:
