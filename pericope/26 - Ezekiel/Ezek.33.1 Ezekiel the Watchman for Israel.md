[[Ezek.33|Ezekiel 33:1 - Ezekiel 33:9]]
*Ezekiel the Watchman for Israel*

[[Ezek.33.1|1]] Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

1: 

[[Ezek.33.2|2]] Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:

2: 

[[Ezek.33.3|3]] If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;

3: 

[[Ezek.33.4|4]] Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.

4: 

[[Ezek.33.5|5]] He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul.

5: 

[[Ezek.33.6|6]] But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take \[any\] person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman’s hand.

6: 

[[Ezek.33.7|7]] So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.

7: 

[[Ezek.33.8|8]] When I say unto the wicked, O wicked \[man\], thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked \[man\] shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.

8: 

[[Ezek.33.9|9]] Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.

9:
