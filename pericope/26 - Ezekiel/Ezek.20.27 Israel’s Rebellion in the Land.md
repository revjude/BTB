[[Ezek.20|Ezekiel 20:27 - Ezekiel 20:32]]
*Israel’s Rebellion in the Land*

[[Ezek.20.27|27]] Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.

27: 

[[Ezek.20.28|28]] \[For\] when I had brought them into the land, \[for\] the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings.

28: 

[[Ezek.20.29|29]] Then I said unto them, What \[is\] the high place whereunto ye go? And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day.

29: 

[[Ezek.20.30|30]] Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after their abominations?

30: 

[[Ezek.20.31|31]] For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? \[As\] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.

31: 

[[Ezek.20.32|32]] And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.

32:
