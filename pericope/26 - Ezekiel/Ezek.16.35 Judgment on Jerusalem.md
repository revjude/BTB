[[Ezek.16|Ezekiel 16:35 - Ezekiel 16:58]]
*Judgment on Jerusalem*

[[Ezek.16.35|35]] Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:

35: 

[[Ezek.16.36|36]] Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;

36: 

[[Ezek.16.37|37]] Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all \[them\] that thou hast loved, with all \[them\] that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.

37: 

[[Ezek.16.38|38]] And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.

38: 

[[Ezek.16.39|39]] And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.

39: 

[[Ezek.16.40|40]] They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.

40: 

[[Ezek.16.41|41]] And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.

41: 

[[Ezek.16.42|42]] So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.

42: 

[[Ezek.16.43|43]] Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these \[things\]; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon \[thine\] head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.

43: 

[[Ezek.16.44|44]] Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use \[this\] proverb against thee, saying, As \[is\] the mother, \[so is\] her daughter.

44: 

[[Ezek.16.45|45]] Thou \[art\] thy mother’s daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou \[art\] the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother \[was\] an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.

45: 

[[Ezek.16.46|46]] And thine elder sister \[is\] Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, \[is\] Sodom and her daughters.

46: 

[[Ezek.16.47|47]] Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as \[if that were\] a very little \[thing\], thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.

47: 

[[Ezek.16.48|48]] \[As\] I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.

48: 

[[Ezek.16.49|49]] Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.

49: 

[[Ezek.16.50|50]] And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw \[good\].

50: 

[[Ezek.16.51|51]] Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.

51: 

[[Ezek.16.52|52]] Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.

52: 

[[Ezek.16.53|53]] When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then \[will I bring again\] the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:

53: 

[[Ezek.16.54|54]] That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.

54: 

[[Ezek.16.55|55]] When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.

55: 

[[Ezek.16.56|56]] For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,

56: 

[[Ezek.16.57|57]] Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of \[thy\] reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all \[that are\] round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about.

57: 

[[Ezek.16.58|58]] Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the LORD.
