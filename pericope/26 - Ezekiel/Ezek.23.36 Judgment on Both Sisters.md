[[Ezek.23|Ezekiel 23:36 - Ezekiel 23:49]]
*Judgment on Both Sisters*

[[Ezek.23.36|36]] The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;

36: 

[[Ezek.23.37|37]] That they have committed adultery, and blood \[is\] in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through \[the fire\], to devour \[them\].

37: 

[[Ezek.23.38|38]] Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.

38: 

[[Ezek.23.39|39]] For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.

39: 

[[Ezek.23.40|40]] And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger \[was\] sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,

40: 

[[Ezek.23.41|41]] And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.

41: 

[[Ezek.23.42|42]] And a voice of a multitude being at ease \[was\] with her: and with the men of the common sort \[were\] brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.

42: 

[[Ezek.23.43|43]] Then said I unto \[her that was\] old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she \[with them\]?

43: 

[[Ezek.23.44|44]] Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.

44: 

[[Ezek.23.45|45]] And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they \[are\] adulteresses, and blood \[is\] in their hands.

45: 

[[Ezek.23.46|46]] For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.

46: 

[[Ezek.23.47|47]] And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.

47: 

[[Ezek.23.48|48]] Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.

48: 

[[Ezek.23.49|49]] And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I \[am\] the Lord GOD.

49:
