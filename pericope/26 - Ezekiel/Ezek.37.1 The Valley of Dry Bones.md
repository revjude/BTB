[[Ezek.37|Ezekiel 37:1 - Ezekiel 37:14]]
*The Valley of Dry Bones*

[[Ezek.37.1|1]] The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which \[was\] full of bones,

1: 

[[Ezek.37.2|2]] And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, \[there were\] very many in the open valley; and, lo, \[they were\] very dry.

2: 

[[Ezek.37.3|3]] And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.

3: 

[[Ezek.37.4|4]] Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.

4: 

[[Ezek.37.5|5]] Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:

5: 

[[Ezek.37.6|6]] And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

6: 

[[Ezek.37.7|7]] So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.

7: 

[[Ezek.37.8|8]] And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but \[there was\] no breath in them.

8: 

[[Ezek.37.9|9]] Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.

9: 

[[Ezek.37.10|10]] So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.

10: 

[[Ezek.37.11|11]] Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.

11: 

[[Ezek.37.12|12]] Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.

12: 

[[Ezek.37.13|13]] And ye shall know that I \[am\] the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,

13: 

[[Ezek.37.14|14]] And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken \[it\], and performed \[it\], saith the LORD.

14:
