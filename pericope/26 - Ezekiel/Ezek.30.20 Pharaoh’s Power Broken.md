[[Ezek.30|Ezekiel 30:20 - Ezekiel 30:26]]
*Pharaoh’s Power Broken*

[[Ezek.30.20|20]] And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first \[month\], in the seventh \[day\] of the month, \[that\] the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

20: 

[[Ezek.30.21|21]] Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a roller to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword.

21: 

[[Ezek.30.22|22]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I \[am\] against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.

22: 

[[Ezek.30.23|23]] And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.

23: 

[[Ezek.30.24|24]] And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh’s arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded \[man\].

24: 

[[Ezek.30.25|25]] But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I \[am\] the LORD, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.

25: 

[[Ezek.30.26|26]] And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

26:
