[[Ezek.16|Ezekiel 16:59 - Ezekiel 16:63]]
*The Covenant Remembered*

[[Ezek.16.59|59]] For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.

59: 

[[Ezek.16.60|60]] Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.

60: 

[[Ezek.16.61|61]] Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.

61: 

[[Ezek.16.62|62]] And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I \[am\] the LORD:

62: 

[[Ezek.16.63|63]] That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.

63:
