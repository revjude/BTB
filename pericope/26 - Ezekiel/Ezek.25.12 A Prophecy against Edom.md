[[Ezek.25|Ezekiel 25:12 - Ezekiel 25:14]]
*A Prophecy against Edom*

[[Ezek.25.12|12]] Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;

12: 

[[Ezek.25.13|13]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.

13: 

[[Ezek.25.14|14]] And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD.

14:
