[[Ezek.48|Ezekiel 48:8 - Ezekiel 48:14]]
*The Portions for the Priests and Levites*

[[Ezek.48.8|8]] And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, shall be the offering which ye shall offer of five and twenty thousand \[reeds in\] breadth, and \[in\] length as one of the \[other\] parts, from the east side unto the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it.

8: 

[[Ezek.48.9|9]] The oblation that ye shall offer unto the LORD \[shall be\] of five and twenty thousand in length, and of ten thousand in breadth.

9: 

[[Ezek.48.10|10]] And for them, \[even\] for the priests, shall be \[this\] holy oblation; toward the north five and twenty thousand \[in length\], and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the LORD shall be in the midst thereof.

10: 

[[Ezek.48.11|11]] \[It shall be\] for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok; which have kept my charge, which went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.

11: 

[[Ezek.48.12|12]] And \[this\] oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites.

12: 

[[Ezek.48.13|13]] And over against the border of the priests the Levites \[shall have\] five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: all the length \[shall be\] five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand.

13: 

[[Ezek.48.14|14]] And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate the firstfruits of the land: for \[it is\] holy unto the LORD.

14:
