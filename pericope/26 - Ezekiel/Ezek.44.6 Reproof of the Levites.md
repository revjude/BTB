[[Ezek.44|Ezekiel 44:6 - Ezekiel 44:14]]
*Reproof of the Levites*

[[Ezek.44.6|6]] And thou shalt say to the rebellious, \[even\] to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations,

6: 

[[Ezek.44.7|7]] In that ye have brought \[into my sanctuary\] strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, \[even\] my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.

7: 

[[Ezek.44.8|8]] And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.

8: 

[[Ezek.44.9|9]] Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that \[is\] among the children of Israel.

9: 

[[Ezek.44.10|10]] And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity.

10: 

[[Ezek.44.11|11]] Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, \[having\] charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them.

11: 

[[Ezek.44.12|12]] Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity.

12: 

[[Ezek.44.13|13]] And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy \[place\]: but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.

13: 

[[Ezek.44.14|14]] But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.

14:
