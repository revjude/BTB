[[Ezek.25|Ezekiel 25:1 - Ezekiel 25:7]]
*A Prophecy against Ammon*

[[Ezek.25.1|1]] The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

1: 

[[Ezek.25.2|2]] Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;

2: 

[[Ezek.25.3|3]] And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;

3: 

[[Ezek.25.4|4]] Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.

4: 

[[Ezek.25.5|5]] And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks: and ye shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

5: 

[[Ezek.25.6|6]] For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped \[thine\] hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel;

6: 

[[Ezek.25.7|7]] Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I \[am\] the LORD.

7:
