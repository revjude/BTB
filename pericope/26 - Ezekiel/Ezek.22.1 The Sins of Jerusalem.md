[[Ezek.22|Ezekiel 22:1 - Ezekiel 22:16]]
*The Sins of Jerusalem*

[[Ezek.22.1|1]] Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

1: 

[[Ezek.22.2|2]] Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.

2: 

[[Ezek.22.3|3]] Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.

3: 

[[Ezek.22.4|4]] Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come \[even\] unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.

4: 

[[Ezek.22.5|5]] \[Those that be\] near, and \[those that be\] far from thee, shall mock thee, \[which art\] infamous \[and\] much vexed.

5: 

[[Ezek.22.6|6]] Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood.

6: 

[[Ezek.22.7|7]] In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.

7: 

[[Ezek.22.8|8]] Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.

8: 

[[Ezek.22.9|9]] In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.

9: 

[[Ezek.22.10|10]] In thee have they discovered their fathers’ nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.

10: 

[[Ezek.22.11|11]] And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour’s wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father’s daughter.

11: 

[[Ezek.22.12|12]] In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.

12: 

[[Ezek.22.13|13]] Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.

13: 

[[Ezek.22.14|14]] Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken \[it\], and will do \[it\].

14: 

[[Ezek.22.15|15]] And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.

15: 

[[Ezek.22.16|16]] And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I \[am\] the LORD.
