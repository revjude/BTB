[[Ezek.28|Ezekiel 28:11 - Ezekiel 28:19]]
*A Lament for the King of Tyre*

[[Ezek.28.11|11]] Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

11: 

[[Ezek.28.12|12]] Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.

12: 

[[Ezek.28.13|13]] Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone \[was\] thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.

13: 

[[Ezek.28.14|14]] Thou \[art\] the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee \[so\]: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.

14: 

[[Ezek.28.15|15]] Thou \[wast\] perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.

15: 

[[Ezek.28.16|16]] By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.

16: 

[[Ezek.28.17|17]] Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.

17: 

[[Ezek.28.18|18]] Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.

18: 

[[Ezek.28.19|19]] All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never \[shalt\] thou \[be\] any more.

19:
