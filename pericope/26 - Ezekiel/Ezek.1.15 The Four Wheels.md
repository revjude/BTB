[[Ezek.1|Ezekiel 1:15 - Ezekiel 1:21]]
*The Four Wheels*

[[Ezek.1.15|15]] Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.

15: 

[[Ezek.1.16|16]] The appearance of the wheels and their work \[was\] like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work \[was\] as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.

16: 

[[Ezek.1.17|17]] When they went, they went upon their four sides: \[and\] they turned not when they went.

17: 

[[Ezek.1.18|18]] As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings \[were\] full of eyes round about them four.

18: 

[[Ezek.1.19|19]] And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.

19: 

[[Ezek.1.20|20]] Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither \[was their\] spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature \[was\] in the wheels.

20: 

[[Ezek.1.21|21]] When those went, \[these\] went; and when those stood, \[these\] stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature \[was\] in the wheels.

21:
