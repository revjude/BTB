[[Ezek.23|Ezekiel 23:22 - Ezekiel 23:35]]
*Oholibah to Be Plagued*

[[Ezek.23.22|22]] Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;

22: 

[[Ezek.23.23|23]] The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, \[and\] all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.

23: 

[[Ezek.23.24|24]] And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, \[which\] shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.

24: 

[[Ezek.23.25|25]] And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.

25: 

[[Ezek.23.26|26]] They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.

26: 

[[Ezek.23.27|27]] Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom \[brought\] from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.

27: 

[[Ezek.23.28|28]] For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand \[of them\] whom thou hatest, into the hand \[of them\] from whom thy mind is alienated:

28: 

[[Ezek.23.29|29]] And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.

29: 

[[Ezek.23.30|30]] I will do these \[things\] unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, \[and\] because thou art polluted with their idols.

30: 

[[Ezek.23.31|31]] Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.

31: 

[[Ezek.23.32|32]] Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.

32: 

[[Ezek.23.33|33]] Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.

33: 

[[Ezek.23.34|34]] Thou shalt even drink it and suck \[it\] out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken \[it\], saith the Lord GOD.

34: 

[[Ezek.23.35|35]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.

35:
