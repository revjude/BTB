[[Ezek.34|Ezekiel 34:25 - Ezekiel 34:31]]
*The Covenant of Peace*

[[Ezek.34.25|25]] And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.

25: 

[[Ezek.34.26|26]] And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.

26: 

[[Ezek.34.27|27]] And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I \[am\] the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them.

27: 

[[Ezek.34.28|28]] And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make \[them\] afraid.

28: 

[[Ezek.34.29|29]] And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.

29: 

[[Ezek.34.30|30]] Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God \[am\] with them, and \[that\] they, \[even\] the house of Israel, \[are\] my people, saith the Lord GOD.

30: 

[[Ezek.34.31|31]] And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, \[are\] men, \[and\] I \[am\] your God, saith the Lord GOD.

31:
