[[Ezek.29|Ezekiel 29:8 - Ezekiel 29:16]]
*The Desolation of Egypt*

[[Ezek.29.8|8]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee.

8: 

[[Ezek.29.9|9]] And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I \[am\] the LORD: because he hath said, The river \[is\] mine, and I have made \[it\].

9: 

[[Ezek.29.10|10]] Behold, therefore I \[am\] against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste \[and\] desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.

10: 

[[Ezek.29.11|11]] No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.

11: 

[[Ezek.29.12|12]] And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries \[that are\] desolate, and her cities among the cities \[that are\] laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.

12: 

[[Ezek.29.13|13]] Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered:

13: 

[[Ezek.29.14|14]] And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return \[into\] the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.

14: 

[[Ezek.29.15|15]] It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.

15: 

[[Ezek.29.16|16]] And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth \[their\] iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I \[am\] the Lord GOD.

16:
