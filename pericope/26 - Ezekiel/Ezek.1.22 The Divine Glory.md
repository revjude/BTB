[[Ezek.1|Ezekiel 1:22 - Ezekiel 1:28]]
*The Divine Glory*

[[Ezek.1.22|22]] And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature \[was\] as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.

22: 

[[Ezek.1.23|23]] And under the firmament \[were\] their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.

23: 

[[Ezek.1.24|24]] And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.

24: 

[[Ezek.1.25|25]] And there was a voice from the firmament that \[was\] over their heads, when they stood, \[and\] had let down their wings.

25: 

[[Ezek.1.26|26]] And above the firmament that \[was\] over their heads \[was\] the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne \[was\] the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.

26: 

[[Ezek.1.27|27]] And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.

27: 

[[Ezek.1.28|28]] As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so \[was\] the appearance of the brightness round about. This \[was\] the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw \[it\], I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.

28:
