[[Ezek.46|Ezekiel 46:19 - Ezekiel 46:24]]
*The Courts for Boiling and Baking*

[[Ezek.46.19|19]] After he brought me through the entry, which \[was\] at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there \[was\] a place on the two sides westward.

19: 

[[Ezek.46.20|20]] Then said he unto me, This \[is\] the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear \[them\] not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people.

20: 

[[Ezek.46.21|21]] Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court \[there was\] a court.

21: 

[[Ezek.46.22|22]] In the four corners of the court \[there were\] courts joined of forty \[cubits\] long and thirty broad: these four corners \[were\] of one measure.

22: 

[[Ezek.46.23|23]] And \[there was\] a row \[of building\] round about in them, round about them four, and \[it was\] made with boiling places under the rows round about.

23: 

[[Ezek.46.24|24]] Then said he unto me, These \[are\] the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.

24:
