[[Ezek.20|Ezekiel 20:10 - Ezekiel 20:26]]
*Israel’s Rebellion in the Wilderness*

[[Ezek.20.10|10]] Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.

10: 

[[Ezek.20.11|11]] And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which \[if\] a man do, he shall even live in them.

11: 

[[Ezek.20.12|12]] Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I \[am\] the LORD that sanctify them.

12: 

[[Ezek.20.13|13]] But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which \[if\] a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.

13: 

[[Ezek.20.14|14]] But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.

14: 

[[Ezek.20.15|15]] Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given \[them\], flowing with milk and honey, which \[is\] the glory of all lands;

15: 

[[Ezek.20.16|16]] Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.

16: 

[[Ezek.20.17|17]] Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.

17: 

[[Ezek.20.18|18]] But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:

18: 

[[Ezek.20.19|19]] I \[am\] the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;

19: 

[[Ezek.20.20|20]] And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I \[am\] the LORD your God.

20: 

[[Ezek.20.21|21]] Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which \[if\] a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.

21: 

[[Ezek.20.22|22]] Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.

22: 

[[Ezek.20.23|23]] I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;

23: 

[[Ezek.20.24|24]] Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols.

24: 

[[Ezek.20.25|25]] Wherefore I gave them also statutes \[that were\] not good, and judgments whereby they should not live;

25: 

[[Ezek.20.26|26]] And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through \[the fire\] all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I \[am\] the LORD.

26:
