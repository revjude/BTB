[[Ezek.11|Ezekiel 11:13 - Ezekiel 11:21]]
*A Promise of Restoration*

[[Ezek.11.13|13]] And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?

13: 

[[Ezek.11.14|14]] Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

14: 

[[Ezek.11.15|15]] Son of man, thy brethren, \[even\] thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, \[are\] they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession.

15: 

[[Ezek.11.16|16]] Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.

16: 

[[Ezek.11.17|17]] Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.

17: 

[[Ezek.11.18|18]] And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.

18: 

[[Ezek.11.19|19]] And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:

19: 

[[Ezek.11.20|20]] That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.

20: 

[[Ezek.11.21|21]] But \[as for them\] whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.

21:
