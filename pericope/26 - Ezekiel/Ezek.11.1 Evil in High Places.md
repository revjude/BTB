[[Ezek.11|Ezekiel 11:1 - Ezekiel 11:12]]
*Evil in High Places*

[[Ezek.11.1|1]] Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the LORD’S house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.

1: 

[[Ezek.11.2|2]] Then said he unto me, Son of man, these \[are\] the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:

2: 

[[Ezek.11.3|3]] Which say, \[It is\] not near; let us build houses: this \[city is\] the caldron, and we \[be\] the flesh.

3: 

[[Ezek.11.4|4]] Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.

4: 

[[Ezek.11.5|5]] And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, \[every one of\] them.

5: 

[[Ezek.11.6|6]] Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.

6: 

[[Ezek.11.7|7]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they \[are\] the flesh, and this \[city is\] the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.

7: 

[[Ezek.11.8|8]] Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord GOD.

8: 

[[Ezek.11.9|9]] And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.

9: 

[[Ezek.11.10|10]] Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

10: 

[[Ezek.11.11|11]] This \[city\] shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; \[but\] I will judge you in the border of Israel:

11: 

[[Ezek.11.12|12]] And ye shall know that I \[am\] the LORD: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that \[are\] round about you.

12:
