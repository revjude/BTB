[[Ezek.22|Ezekiel 22:17 - Ezekiel 22:22]]
*The Refining Furnace*

[[Ezek.22.17|17]] And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

17: 

[[Ezek.22.18|18]] Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they \[are\] brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are \[even\] the dross of silver.

18: 

[[Ezek.22.19|19]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.

19: 

[[Ezek.22.20|20]] \[As\] they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt \[it\]; so will I gather \[you\] in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave \[you there\], and melt you.

20: 

[[Ezek.22.21|21]] Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.

21: 

[[Ezek.22.22|22]] As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.

22:
