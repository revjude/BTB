[[Ezek.25|Ezekiel 25:15 - Ezekiel 25:17]]
*A Prophecy against the Philistines*

[[Ezek.25.15|15]] Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy \[it\] for the old hatred;

15: 

[[Ezek.25.16|16]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.

16: 

[[Ezek.25.17|17]] And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I \[am\] the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.

17:
