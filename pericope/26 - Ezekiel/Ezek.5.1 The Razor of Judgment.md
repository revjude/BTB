[[Ezek.5|Ezekiel 5:1 - Ezekiel 5:10]]
*The Razor of Judgment*

[[Ezek.5.1|1]] And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber’s rasor, and cause \[it\] to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the \[hair\].

1: 

[[Ezek.5.2|2]] Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, \[and\] smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.

2: 

[[Ezek.5.3|3]] Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.

3: 

[[Ezek.5.4|4]] Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; \[for\] thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.

4: 

[[Ezek.5.5|5]] Thus saith the Lord GOD; This \[is\] Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries \[that are\] round about her.

5: 

[[Ezek.5.6|6]] And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that \[are\] round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them.

6: 

[[Ezek.5.7|7]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that \[are\] round about you, \[and\] have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that \[are\] round about you;

7: 

[[Ezek.5.8|8]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, \[am\] against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.

8: 

[[Ezek.5.9|9]] And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.

9: 

[[Ezek.5.10|10]] Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds.

10:
