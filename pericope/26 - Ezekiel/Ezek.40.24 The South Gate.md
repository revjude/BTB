[[Ezek.40|Ezekiel 40:24 - Ezekiel 40:27]]
*The South Gate*

[[Ezek.40.24|24]] After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.

24: 

[[Ezek.40.25|25]] And \[there were\] windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length \[was\] fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.

25: 

[[Ezek.40.26|26]] And \[there were\] seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof \[were\] before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.

26: 

[[Ezek.40.27|27]] And \[there was\] a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits.
