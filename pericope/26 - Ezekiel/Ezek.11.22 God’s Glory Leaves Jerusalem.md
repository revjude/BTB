[[Ezek.11|Ezekiel 11:22 - Ezekiel 11:25]]
*God’s Glory Leaves Jerusalem*

[[Ezek.11.22|22]] Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel \[was\] over them above.

22: 

[[Ezek.11.23|23]] And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which \[is\] on the east side of the city.

23: 

[[Ezek.11.24|24]] Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.

24: 

[[Ezek.11.25|25]] Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had shewed me.

25:
