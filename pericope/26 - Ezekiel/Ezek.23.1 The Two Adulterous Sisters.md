[[Ezek.23|Ezekiel 23:1 - Ezekiel 23:21]]
*The Two Adulterous Sisters*

[[Ezek.23.1|1]] The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

1: 

[[Ezek.23.2|2]] Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:

2: 

[[Ezek.23.3|3]] And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.

3: 

[[Ezek.23.4|4]] And the names of them \[were\] Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus \[were\] their names; Samaria \[is\] Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.

4: 

[[Ezek.23.5|5]] And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians \[her\] neighbours,

5: 

[[Ezek.23.6|6]] \[Which were\] clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.

6: 

[[Ezek.23.7|7]] Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them \[that were\] the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.

7: 

[[Ezek.23.8|8]] Neither left she her whoredoms \[brought\] from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.

8: 

[[Ezek.23.9|9]] Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.

9: 

[[Ezek.23.10|10]] These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.

10: 

[[Ezek.23.11|11]] And when her sister Aholibah saw \[this\], she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in \[her\] whoredoms.

11: 

[[Ezek.23.12|12]] She doted upon the Assyrians \[her\] neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.

12: 

[[Ezek.23.13|13]] Then I saw that she was defiled, \[that\] they \[took\] both one way,

13: 

[[Ezek.23.14|14]] And \[that\] she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,

14: 

[[Ezek.23.15|15]] Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:

15: 

[[Ezek.23.16|16]] And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.

16: 

[[Ezek.23.17|17]] And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.

17: 

[[Ezek.23.18|18]] So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.

18: 

[[Ezek.23.19|19]] Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.

19: 

[[Ezek.23.20|20]] For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh \[is as\] the flesh of asses, and whose issue \[is like\] the issue of horses.

20: 

[[Ezek.23.21|21]] Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.

21:
