[[Ezek.3|Ezekiel 3:1 - Ezekiel 3:15]]
*Ezekiel Eats the Scroll*

[[Ezek.3.1|1]] Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.

1: 

[[Ezek.3.2|2]] So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.

2: 

[[Ezek.3.3|3]] And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat \[it\]; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.

3: 

[[Ezek.3.4|4]] And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.

4: 

[[Ezek.3.5|5]] For thou \[art\] not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, \[but\] to the house of Israel;

5: 

[[Ezek.3.6|6]] Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.

6: 

[[Ezek.3.7|7]] But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel \[are\] impudent and hardhearted.

7: 

[[Ezek.3.8|8]] Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.

8: 

[[Ezek.3.9|9]] As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they \[be\] a rebellious house.

9: 

[[Ezek.3.10|10]] Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.

10: 

[[Ezek.3.11|11]] And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.

11: 

[[Ezek.3.12|12]] Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, \[saying\], Blessed \[be\] the glory of the LORD from his place.

12: 

[[Ezek.3.13|13]] \[I heard\] also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.

13: 

[[Ezek.3.14|14]] So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.

14: 

[[Ezek.3.15|15]] Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.

15:
