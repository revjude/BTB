[[Ezek.24|Ezekiel 24:1 - Ezekiel 24:14]]
*The Parable of the Cooking Pot*

[[Ezek.24.1|1]] Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth \[day\] of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

1: 

[[Ezek.24.2|2]] Son of man, write thee the name of the day, \[even\] of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.

2: 

[[Ezek.24.3|3]] And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set \[it\] on, and also pour water into it:

3: 

[[Ezek.24.4|4]] Gather the pieces thereof into it, \[even\] every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill \[it\] with the choice bones.

4: 

[[Ezek.24.5|5]] Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, \[and\] make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.

5: 

[[Ezek.24.6|6]] Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum \[is\] therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.

6: 

[[Ezek.24.7|7]] For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;

7: 

[[Ezek.24.8|8]] That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.

8: 

[[Ezek.24.9|9]] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.

9: 

[[Ezek.24.10|10]] Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.

10: 

[[Ezek.24.11|11]] Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and \[that\] the filthiness of it may be molten in it, \[that\] the scum of it may be consumed.

11: 

[[Ezek.24.12|12]] She hath wearied \[herself\] with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum \[shall be\] in the fire.

12: 

[[Ezek.24.13|13]] In thy filthiness \[is\] lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.

13: 

[[Ezek.24.14|14]] I the LORD have spoken \[it\]: it shall come to pass, and I will do \[it\]; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.

14:
