[[Ezek.20|Ezekiel 20:45 - Ezekiel 20:49]]
*A Prophecy against the South*

[[Ezek.20.45|45]] Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

45: 

[[Ezek.20.46|46]] Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop \[thy word\] toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;

46: 

[[Ezek.20.47|47]] And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.

47: 

[[Ezek.20.48|48]] And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.

48: 

[[Ezek.20.49|49]] Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak parables?

49:
