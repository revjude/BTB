[[Ezek.43|Ezekiel 43:13 - Ezekiel 43:27]]
*The Altar of Sacrifice*

[[Ezek.43.13|13]] And these \[are\] the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit \[is\] a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom \[shall be\] a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about \[shall be\] a span: and this \[shall be\] the higher place of the altar.

13: 

[[Ezek.43.14|14]] And from the bottom \[upon\] the ground \[even\] to the lower settle \[shall be\] two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle \[even\] to the greater settle \[shall be\] four cubits, and the breadth \[one\] cubit.

14: 

[[Ezek.43.15|15]] So the altar \[shall be\] four cubits; and from the altar and upward \[shall be\] four horns.

15: 

[[Ezek.43.16|16]] And the altar \[shall be\] twelve \[cubits\] long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof.

16: 

[[Ezek.43.17|17]] And the settle \[shall be\] fourteen \[cubits\] long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it \[shall be\] half a cubit; and the bottom thereof \[shall be\] a cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the east.

17: 

[[Ezek.43.18|18]] And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; These \[are\] the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.

18: 

[[Ezek.43.19|19]] And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering.

19: 

[[Ezek.43.20|20]] And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put \[it\] on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it.

20: 

[[Ezek.43.21|21]] Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.

21: 

[[Ezek.43.22|22]] And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse \[it\] with the bullock.

22: 

[[Ezek.43.23|23]] When thou hast made an end of cleansing \[it\], thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.

23: 

[[Ezek.43.24|24]] And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up \[for\] a burnt offering unto the LORD.

24: 

[[Ezek.43.25|25]] Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat \[for\] a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.

25: 

[[Ezek.43.26|26]] Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves.

26: 

[[Ezek.43.27|27]] And when these days are expired, it shall be, \[that\] upon the eighth day, and \[so\] forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord GOD.
