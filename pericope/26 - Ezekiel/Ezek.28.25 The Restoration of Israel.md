[[Ezek.28|Ezekiel 28:25 - Ezekiel 28:26]]
*The Restoration of Israel*

[[Ezek.28.25|25]] Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob.

25: 

[[Ezek.28.26|26]] And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I \[am\] the LORD their God.

26:
