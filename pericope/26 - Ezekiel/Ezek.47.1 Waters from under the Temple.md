[[Ezek.47|Ezekiel 47:1 - Ezekiel 47:12]]
*Waters from under the Temple*

[[Ezek.47.1|1]] Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house \[stood toward\] the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south \[side\] of the altar.

1: 

[[Ezek.47.2|2]] Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.

2: 

[[Ezek.47.3|3]] And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters \[were\] to the ancles.

3: 

[[Ezek.47.4|4]] Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters \[were\] to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters \[were\] to the loins.

4: 

[[Ezek.47.5|5]] Afterward he measured a thousand; \[and it was\] a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over.

5: 

[[Ezek.47.6|6]] And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen \[this\]? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.

6: 

[[Ezek.47.7|7]] Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river \[were\] very many trees on the one side and on the other.

7: 

[[Ezek.47.8|8]] Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: \[which being\] brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed.

8: 

[[Ezek.47.9|9]] And it shall come to pass, \[that\] every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh.

9: 

[[Ezek.47.10|10]] And it shall come to pass, \[that\] the fishers shall stand upon it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a \[place\] to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.

10: 

[[Ezek.47.11|11]] But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.

11: 

[[Ezek.47.12|12]] And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.

12:
