[[1Kgs.4|1 Kings 4:29 - 1 Kings 4:34]]
*Solomon’s Wisdom*

[[1Kgs.4.29|29]] And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that \[is\] on the sea shore.

29: 

[[1Kgs.4.30|30]] And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.

30: 

[[1Kgs.4.31|31]] For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.

31: 

[[1Kgs.4.32|32]] And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.

32: 

[[1Kgs.4.33|33]] And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that \[is\] in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.

33: 

[[1Kgs.4.34|34]] And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.

34:
