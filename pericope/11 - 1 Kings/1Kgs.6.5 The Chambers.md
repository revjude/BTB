[[1Kgs.6|1 Kings 6:5 - 1 Kings 6:10]]
*The Chambers*

[[1Kgs.6.5|5]] And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, \[against\] the walls of the house round about, \[both\] of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:

5: 

[[1Kgs.6.6|6]] The nethermost chamber \[was\] five cubits broad, and the middle \[was\] six cubits broad, and the third \[was\] seven cubits broad: for without \[in the wall\] of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that \[the beams\] should not be fastened in the walls of the house.

6: 

[[1Kgs.6.7|7]] And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe \[nor\] any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.

7: 

[[1Kgs.6.8|8]] The door for the middle chamber \[was\] in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle \[chamber\], and out of the middle into the third.

8: 

[[1Kgs.6.9|9]] So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.

9: 

[[1Kgs.6.10|10]] And \[then\] he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.

10:
