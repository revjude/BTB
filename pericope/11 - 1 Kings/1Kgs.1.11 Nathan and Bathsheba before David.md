[[1Kgs.1|1 Kings 1:11 - 1 Kings 1:27]]
*Nathan and Bathsheba before David*

[[1Kgs.1.11|11]] Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth \[it\] not?

11: 

[[1Kgs.1.12|12]] Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.

12: 

[[1Kgs.1.13|13]] Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?

13: 

[[1Kgs.1.14|14]] Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.

14: 

[[1Kgs.1.15|15]] And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.

15: 

[[1Kgs.1.16|16]] And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?

16: 

[[1Kgs.1.17|17]] And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, \[saying\], Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.

17: 

[[1Kgs.1.18|18]] And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest \[it\] not:

18: 

[[1Kgs.1.19|19]] And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.

19: 

[[1Kgs.1.20|20]] And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel \[are\] upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.

20: 

[[1Kgs.1.21|21]] Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.

21: 

[[1Kgs.1.22|22]] And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.

22: 

[[1Kgs.1.23|23]] And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.

23: 

[[1Kgs.1.24|24]] And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?

24: 

[[1Kgs.1.25|25]] For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.

25: 

[[1Kgs.1.26|26]] But me, \[even\] me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.

26: 

[[1Kgs.1.27|27]] Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed \[it\] unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?

27:
