[[1Kgs.14|1 Kings 14:25 - 1 Kings 14:31]]
*Shishak Raids Jerusalem*

[[1Kgs.14.25|25]] And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, \[that\] Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:

25: 

[[1Kgs.14.26|26]] And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.

26: 

[[1Kgs.14.27|27]] And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed \[them\] unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king’s house.

27: 

[[1Kgs.14.28|28]] And it was \[so\], when the king went into the house of the LORD, that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.

28: 

[[1Kgs.14.29|29]] Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, \[are\] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

29: 

[[1Kgs.14.30|30]] And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all \[their\] days.

30: 

[[1Kgs.14.31|31]] And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother’s name \[was\] Naamah an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.

31:
