[[1Kgs.8|1 Kings 8:54 - 1 Kings 8:61]]
*Solomon’s Benediction*

[[1Kgs.8.54|54]] And it was \[so\], that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.

54: 

[[1Kgs.8.55|55]] And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,

55: 

[[1Kgs.8.56|56]] Blessed \[be\] the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.

56: 

[[1Kgs.8.57|57]] The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:

57: 

[[1Kgs.8.58|58]] That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.

58: 

[[1Kgs.8.59|59]] And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:

59: 

[[1Kgs.8.60|60]] That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD \[is\] God, \[and that there is\] none else.

60: 

[[1Kgs.8.61|61]] Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.

61:
