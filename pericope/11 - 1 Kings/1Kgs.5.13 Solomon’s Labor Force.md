[[1Kgs.5|1 Kings 5:13 - 1 Kings 5:18]]
*Solomon’s Labor Force*

[[1Kgs.5.13|13]] And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.

13: 

[[1Kgs.5.14|14]] And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, \[and\] two months at home: and Adoniram \[was\] over the levy.

14: 

[[1Kgs.5.15|15]] And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;

15: 

[[1Kgs.5.16|16]] Beside the chief of Solomon’s officers which \[were\] over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.

16: 

[[1Kgs.5.17|17]] And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, \[and\] hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.

17: 

[[1Kgs.5.18|18]] And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders did hew \[them\], and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.

18:
