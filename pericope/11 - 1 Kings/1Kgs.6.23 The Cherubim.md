[[1Kgs.6|1 Kings 6:23 - 1 Kings 6:30]]
*The Cherubim*

[[1Kgs.6.23|23]] And within the oracle he made two cherubims \[of\] olive tree, \[each\] ten cubits high.

23: 

[[1Kgs.6.24|24]] And five cubits \[was\] the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other \[were\] ten cubits.

24: 

[[1Kgs.6.25|25]] And the other cherub \[was\] ten cubits: both the cherubims \[were\] of one measure and one size.

25: 

[[1Kgs.6.26|26]] The height of the one cherub \[was\] ten cubits, and so \[was it\] of the other cherub.

26: 

[[1Kgs.6.27|27]] And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the \[one\] wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.

27: 

[[1Kgs.6.28|28]] And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.

28: 

[[1Kgs.6.29|29]] And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.

29: 

[[1Kgs.6.30|30]] And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.

30:
