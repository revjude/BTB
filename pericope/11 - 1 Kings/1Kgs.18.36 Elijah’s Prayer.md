[[1Kgs.18|1 Kings 18:36 - 1 Kings 18:40]]
*Elijah’s Prayer*

[[1Kgs.18.36|36]] And it came to pass at \[the time of\] the offering of the \[evening\] sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou \[art\] God in Israel, and \[that\] I \[am\] thy servant, and \[that\] I have done all these things at thy word.

36: 

[[1Kgs.18.37|37]] Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou \[art\] the LORD God, and \[that\] thou hast turned their heart back again.

37: 

[[1Kgs.18.38|38]] Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that \[was\] in the trench.

38: 

[[1Kgs.18.39|39]] And when all the people saw \[it\], they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he \[is\] the God; the LORD, he \[is\] the God.

39: 

[[1Kgs.18.40|40]] And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.

40:
