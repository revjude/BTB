[[1Kgs.16|1 Kings 16:21 - 1 Kings 16:28]]
*Omri Reigns in Israel*

[[1Kgs.16.21|21]] Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.

21: 

[[1Kgs.16.22|22]] But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.

22: 

[[1Kgs.16.23|23]] In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.

23: 

[[1Kgs.16.24|24]] And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.

24: 

[[1Kgs.16.25|25]] But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that \[were\] before him.

25: 

[[1Kgs.16.26|26]] For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.

26: 

[[1Kgs.16.27|27]] Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he shewed, \[are\] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

27: 

[[1Kgs.16.28|28]] So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.

28:
