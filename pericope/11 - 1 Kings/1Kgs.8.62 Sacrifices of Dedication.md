[[1Kgs.8|1 Kings 8:62 - 1 Kings 8:66]]
*Sacrifices of Dedication*

[[1Kgs.8.62|62]] And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.

62: 

[[1Kgs.8.63|63]] And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.

63: 

[[1Kgs.8.64|64]] The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that \[was\] before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that \[was\] before the LORD \[was\] too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.

64: 

[[1Kgs.8.65|65]] And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, \[even\] fourteen days.

65: 

[[1Kgs.8.66|66]] On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.

66:
