[[1Kgs.12|1 Kings 12:20 - 1 Kings 12:24]]
*Shemaiah’s Prophecy*

[[1Kgs.12.20|20]] And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.

20: 

[[1Kgs.12.21|21]] And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.

21: 

[[1Kgs.12.22|22]] But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,

22: 

[[1Kgs.12.23|23]] Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,

23: 

[[1Kgs.12.24|24]] Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.

24:
