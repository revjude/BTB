[[1Kgs.12|1 Kings 12:25 - 1 Kings 12:33]]
*Jeroboam’s Idolatry*

[[1Kgs.12.25|25]] Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.

25: 

[[1Kgs.12.26|26]] And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:

26: 

[[1Kgs.12.27|27]] If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, \[even\] unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.

27: 

[[1Kgs.12.28|28]] Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves \[of\] gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

28: 

[[1Kgs.12.29|29]] And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.

29: 

[[1Kgs.12.30|30]] And this thing became a sin: for the people went \[to worship\] before the one, \[even\] unto Dan.

30: 

[[1Kgs.12.31|31]] And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.

31: 

[[1Kgs.12.32|32]] And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that \[is\] in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.

32: 

[[1Kgs.12.33|33]] So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, \[even\] in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.

33:
