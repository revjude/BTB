[[1Kgs.21|1 Kings 21:1 - 1 Kings 21:7]]
*Naboth’s Vineyard*

[[1Kgs.21.1|1]] And it came to pass after these things, \[that\] Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which \[was\] in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.

1: 

[[1Kgs.21.2|2]] And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it \[is\] near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; \[or\], if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.

2: 

[[1Kgs.21.3|3]] And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.

3: 

[[1Kgs.21.4|4]] And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.

4: 

[[1Kgs.21.5|5]] But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?

5: 

[[1Kgs.21.6|6]] And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee \[another\] vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.

6: 

[[1Kgs.21.7|7]] And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, \[and\] eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.

7:
