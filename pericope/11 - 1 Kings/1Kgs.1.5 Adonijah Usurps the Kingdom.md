*Adonijah Usurps the Kingdom*

[[1Kgs.1.6|6]] And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also \[was a\] very goodly \[man\]; and \[his mother\] bare him after Absalom.

6: 

[[1Kgs.1.7|7]] And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped \[him\].

7: 

[[1Kgs.1.8|8]] But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which \[belonged\] to David, were not with Adonijah.

8:
