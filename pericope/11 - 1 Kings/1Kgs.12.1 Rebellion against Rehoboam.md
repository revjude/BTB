[[1Kgs.12|1 Kings 12:1 - 1 Kings 12:15]]
*Rebellion against Rehoboam*

[[1Kgs.12.1|1]] And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.

1: 

[[1Kgs.12.2|2]] And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard \[of it\], (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)

2: 

[[1Kgs.12.3|3]] That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,

3: 

[[1Kgs.12.4|4]] Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.

4: 

[[1Kgs.12.5|5]] And he said unto them, Depart yet \[for\] three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.

5: 

[[1Kgs.12.6|6]] And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?

6: 

[[1Kgs.12.7|7]] And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.

7: 

[[1Kgs.12.8|8]] But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, \[and\] which stood before him:

8: 

[[1Kgs.12.9|9]] And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?

9: 

[[1Kgs.12.10|10]] And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou \[it\] lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little \[finger\] shall be thicker than my father’s loins.

10: 

[[1Kgs.12.11|11]] And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.

11: 

[[1Kgs.12.12|12]] So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.

12: 

[[1Kgs.12.13|13]] And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men’s counsel that they gave him;

13: 

[[1Kgs.12.14|14]] And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father \[also\] chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.

14: 

[[1Kgs.12.15|15]] Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

15:
