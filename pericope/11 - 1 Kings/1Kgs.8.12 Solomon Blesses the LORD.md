[[1Kgs.8|1 Kings 8:12 - 1 Kings 8:21]]
*Solomon Blesses the LORD*

[[1Kgs.8.12|12]] Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.

12: 

[[1Kgs.8.13|13]] I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.

13: 

[[1Kgs.8.14|14]] And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)

14: 

[[1Kgs.8.15|15]] And he said, Blessed \[be\] the LORD God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled \[it\], saying,

15: 

[[1Kgs.8.16|16]] Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.

16: 

[[1Kgs.8.17|17]] And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

17: 

[[1Kgs.8.18|18]] And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart.

18: 

[[1Kgs.8.19|19]] Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.

19: 

[[1Kgs.8.20|20]] And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

20: 

[[1Kgs.8.21|21]] And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein \[is\] the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.

21:
