[[1Kgs.16|1 Kings 16:29 - 1 Kings 16:34]]
*Ahab Reigns in Israel, Marries Jezebel*

[[1Kgs.16.29|29]] And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.

29: 

[[1Kgs.16.30|30]] And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that \[were\] before him.

30: 

[[1Kgs.16.31|31]] And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.

31: 

[[1Kgs.16.32|32]] And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.

32: 

[[1Kgs.16.33|33]] And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.

33: 

[[1Kgs.16.34|34]] In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest \[son\] Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.

34:
