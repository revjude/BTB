[[1Kgs.11|1 Kings 11:9 - 1 Kings 11:13]]
*God’s Anger against Solomon*

[[1Kgs.11.9|9]] And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,

9: 

[[1Kgs.11.10|10]] And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.

10: 

[[1Kgs.11.11|11]] Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.

11: 

[[1Kgs.11.12|12]] Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father’s sake: \[but\] I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.

12: 

[[1Kgs.11.13|13]] Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; \[but\] will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake which I have chosen.

13:
