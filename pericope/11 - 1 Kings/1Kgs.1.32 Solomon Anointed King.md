[[1Kgs.1|1 Kings 1:32 - 1 Kings 1:40]]
*Solomon Anointed King*

[[1Kgs.1.32|32]] And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.

32: 

[[1Kgs.1.33|33]] The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:

33: 

[[1Kgs.1.34|34]] And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.

34: 

[[1Kgs.1.35|35]] Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.

35: 

[[1Kgs.1.36|36]] And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so \[too\].

36: 

[[1Kgs.1.37|37]] As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.

37: 

[[1Kgs.1.38|38]] So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon.

38: 

[[1Kgs.1.39|39]] And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.

39: 

[[1Kgs.1.40|40]] And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.

40:
