[[1Kgs.9|1 Kings 9:1 - 1 Kings 9:9]]
*The LORD’s Response to Solomon*

[[1Kgs.9.1|1]] And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king’s house, and all Solomon’s desire which he was pleased to do,

1: 

[[1Kgs.9.2|2]] That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.

2: 

[[1Kgs.9.3|3]] And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.

3: 

[[1Kgs.9.4|4]] And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, \[and\] wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:

4: 

[[1Kgs.9.5|5]] Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.

5: 

[[1Kgs.9.6|6]] \[But\] if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments \[and\] my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:

6: 

[[1Kgs.9.7|7]] Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:

7: 

[[1Kgs.9.8|8]] And at this house, \[which\] is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?

8: 

[[1Kgs.9.9|9]] And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.

9:
