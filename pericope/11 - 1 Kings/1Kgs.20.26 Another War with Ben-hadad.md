[[1Kgs.20|1 Kings 20:26 - 1 Kings 20:30]]
*Another War with Ben-hadad*

[[1Kgs.20.26|26]] And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.

26: 

[[1Kgs.20.27|27]] And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.

27: 

[[1Kgs.20.28|28]] And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD \[is\] God of the hills, but he \[is\] not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

28: 

[[1Kgs.20.29|29]] And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And \[so\] it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.

29: 

[[1Kgs.20.30|30]] But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and \[there\] a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men \[that were\] left. And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.

30:
