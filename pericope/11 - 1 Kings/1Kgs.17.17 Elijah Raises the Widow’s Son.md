[[1Kgs.17|1 Kings 17:17 - 1 Kings 17:24]]
*Elijah Raises the Widow’s Son*

[[1Kgs.17.17|17]] And it came to pass after these things, \[that\] the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.

17: 

[[1Kgs.17.18|18]] And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?

18: 

[[1Kgs.17.19|19]] And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.

19: 

[[1Kgs.17.20|20]] And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?

20: 

[[1Kgs.17.21|21]] And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child’s soul come into him again.

21: 

[[1Kgs.17.22|22]] And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.

22: 

[[1Kgs.17.23|23]] And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.

23: 

[[1Kgs.17.24|24]] And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou \[art\] a man of God, \[and\] that the word of the LORD in thy mouth \[is\] truth.

24:
