[[1Kgs.6|1 Kings 6:31 - 1 Kings 6:35]]
*The Doors*

[[1Kgs.6.31|31]] And for the entering of the oracle he made doors \[of\] olive tree: the lintel \[and\] side posts \[were\] a fifth part \[of the wall\].

31: 

[[1Kgs.6.32|32]] The two doors also \[were of\] olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid \[them\] with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.

32: 

[[1Kgs.6.33|33]] So also made he for the door of the temple posts \[of\] olive tree, a fourth part \[of the wall\].

33: 

[[1Kgs.6.34|34]] And the two doors \[were of\] fir tree: the two leaves of the one door \[were\] folding, and the two leaves of the other door \[were\] folding.

34: 

[[1Kgs.6.35|35]] And he carved \[thereon\] cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered \[them\] with gold fitted upon the carved work.

35:
