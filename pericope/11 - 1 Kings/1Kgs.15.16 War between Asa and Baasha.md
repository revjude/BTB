[[1Kgs.15|1 Kings 15:16 - 1 Kings 15:22]]
*War between Asa and Baasha*

[[1Kgs.15.16|16]] And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.

16: 

[[1Kgs.15.17|17]] And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.

17: 

[[1Kgs.15.18|18]] Then Asa took all the silver and the gold \[that were\] left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,

18: 

[[1Kgs.15.19|19]] \[There is\] a league between me and thee, \[and\] between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.

19: 

[[1Kgs.15.20|20]] So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.

20: 

[[1Kgs.15.21|21]] And it came to pass, when Baasha heard \[thereof\], that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.

21: 

[[1Kgs.15.22|22]] Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none \[was\] exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.

22:
