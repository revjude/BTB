[[1Kgs.16|1 Kings 16:1 - 1 Kings 16:7]]
*Jehu’s Prophecy against Baasha*

[[1Kgs.16.1|1]] Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,

1: 

[[1Kgs.16.2|2]] Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;

2: 

[[1Kgs.16.3|3]] Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

3: 

[[1Kgs.16.4|4]] Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.

4: 

[[1Kgs.16.5|5]] Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, \[are\] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

5: 

[[1Kgs.16.6|6]] So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.

6: 

[[1Kgs.16.7|7]] And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.

7:
