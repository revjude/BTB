[[1Kgs.12|1 Kings 12:16 - 1 Kings 12:19]]
*The Kingdom Divided*

[[1Kgs.12.16|16]] So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither \[have we\] inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents.

16: 

[[1Kgs.12.17|17]] But \[as for\] the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

17: 

[[1Kgs.12.18|18]] Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who \[was\] over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.

18: 

[[1Kgs.12.19|19]] So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
