[[1Kgs.22|1 Kings 22:41 - 1 Kings 22:50]]
*Jehoshaphat Reigns in Judah*

[[1Kgs.22.41|41]] And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.

41: 

[[1Kgs.22.42|42]] Jehoshaphat \[was\] thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name \[was\] Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.

42: 

[[1Kgs.22.43|43]] And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing \[that which was\] right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; \[for\] the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.

43: 

[[1Kgs.22.44|44]] And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.

44: 

[[1Kgs.22.45|45]] Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, \[are\] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

45: 

[[1Kgs.22.46|46]] And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.

46: 

[[1Kgs.22.47|47]] \[There was\] then no king in Edom: a deputy \[was\] king.

47: 

[[1Kgs.22.48|48]] Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.

48: 

[[1Kgs.22.49|49]] Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.

49: 

[[1Kgs.22.50|50]] And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.

50:
