[[1Kgs.15|1 Kings 15:9 - 1 Kings 15:15]]
*Asa Reigns in Judah*

[[1Kgs.15.9|9]] And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.

9: 

[[1Kgs.15.10|10]] And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name \[was\] Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.

10: 

[[1Kgs.15.11|11]] And Asa did \[that which was\] right in the eyes of the LORD, as \[did\] David his father.

11: 

[[1Kgs.15.12|12]] And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.

12: 

[[1Kgs.15.13|13]] And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from \[being\] queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt \[it\] by the brook Kidron.

13: 

[[1Kgs.15.14|14]] But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa’s heart was perfect with the LORD all his days.

14: 

[[1Kgs.15.15|15]] And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.

15:
