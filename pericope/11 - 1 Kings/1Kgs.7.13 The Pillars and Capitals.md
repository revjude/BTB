[[1Kgs.7|1 Kings 7:13 - 1 Kings 7:22]]
*The Pillars and Capitals*

[[1Kgs.7.13|13]] And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.

13: 

[[1Kgs.7.14|14]] He \[was\] a widow’s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father \[was\] a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.

14: 

[[1Kgs.7.15|15]] For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.

15: 

[[1Kgs.7.16|16]] And he made two chapiters \[of\] molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter \[was\] five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter \[was\] five cubits:

16: 

[[1Kgs.7.17|17]] \[And\] nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which \[were\] upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.

17: 

[[1Kgs.7.18|18]] And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that \[were\] upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.

18: 

[[1Kgs.7.19|19]] And the chapiters that \[were\] upon the top of the pillars \[were\] of lily work in the porch, four cubits.

19: 

[[1Kgs.7.20|20]] And the chapiters upon the two pillars \[had pomegranates\] also above, over against the belly which \[was\] by the network: and the pomegranates \[were\] two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.

20: 

[[1Kgs.7.21|21]] And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.

21: 

[[1Kgs.7.22|22]] And upon the top of the pillars \[was\] lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.

22:
