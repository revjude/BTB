[[1Kgs.19|1 Kings 19:9 - 1 Kings 19:18]]
*The LORD Speaks to Elijah at Horeb*

[[1Kgs.19.9|9]] And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD \[came\] to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?

9: 

[[1Kgs.19.10|10]] And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, \[even\] I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.

10: 

[[1Kgs.19.11|11]] And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; \[but\] the LORD \[was\] not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; \[but\] the LORD \[was\] not in the earthquake:

11: 

[[1Kgs.19.12|12]] And after the earthquake a fire; \[but\] the LORD \[was\] not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.

12: 

[[1Kgs.19.13|13]] And it was \[so\], when Elijah heard \[it\], that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, \[there came\] a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?

13: 

[[1Kgs.19.14|14]] And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, \[even\] I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.

14: 

[[1Kgs.19.15|15]] And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael \[to be\] king over Syria:

15: 

[[1Kgs.19.16|16]] And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint \[to be\] king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint \[to be\] prophet in thy room.

16: 

[[1Kgs.19.17|17]] And it shall come to pass, \[that\] him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.

17: 

[[1Kgs.19.18|18]] Yet I have left \[me\] seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.

18:
