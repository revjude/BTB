[[1Kgs.4|1 Kings 4:20 - 1 Kings 4:28]]
*Solomon’s Prosperity*

[[1Kgs.4.20|20]] Judah and Israel \[were\] many, as the sand which \[is\] by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.

20: 

[[1Kgs.4.21|21]] And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.

21: 

[[1Kgs.4.22|22]] And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,

22: 

[[1Kgs.4.23|23]] Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.

23: 

[[1Kgs.4.24|24]] For he had dominion over all \[the region\] on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.

24: 

[[1Kgs.4.25|25]] And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.

25: 

[[1Kgs.4.26|26]] And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.

26: 

[[1Kgs.4.27|27]] And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.

27: 

[[1Kgs.4.28|28]] Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where \[the officers\] were, every man according to his charge.

28:
