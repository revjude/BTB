[[1Kgs.10|1 Kings 10:14 - 1 Kings 10:29]]
*Solomon’s Wealth and Splendor*

[[1Kgs.10.14|14]] Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,

14: 

[[1Kgs.10.15|15]] Beside \[that he had\] of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.

15: 

[[1Kgs.10.16|16]] And king Solomon made two hundred targets \[of\] beaten gold: six hundred \[shekels\] of gold went to one target.

16: 

[[1Kgs.10.17|17]] And \[he made\] three hundred shields \[of\] beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.

17: 

[[1Kgs.10.18|18]] Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.

18: 

[[1Kgs.10.19|19]] The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne \[was\] round behind: and \[there were\] stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.

19: 

[[1Kgs.10.20|20]] And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.

20: 

[[1Kgs.10.21|21]] And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels \[were of\] gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon \[were of\] pure gold; none \[were of\] silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.

21: 

[[1Kgs.10.22|22]] For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

22: 

[[1Kgs.10.23|23]] So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.

23: 

[[1Kgs.10.24|24]] And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.

24: 

[[1Kgs.10.25|25]] And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.

25: 

[[1Kgs.10.26|26]] And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.

26: 

[[1Kgs.10.27|27]] And the king made silver \[to be\] in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he \[to be\] as the sycomore trees that \[are\] in the vale, for abundance.

27: 

[[1Kgs.10.28|28]] And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.

28: 

[[1Kgs.10.29|29]] And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred \[shekels\] of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring \[them\] out by their means.

29:
