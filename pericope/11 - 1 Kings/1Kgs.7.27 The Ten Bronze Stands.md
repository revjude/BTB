[[1Kgs.7|1 Kings 7:27 - 1 Kings 7:37]]
*The Ten Bronze Stands*

[[1Kgs.7.27|27]] And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits \[was\] the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.

27: 

[[1Kgs.7.28|28]] And the work of the bases \[was\] on this \[manner\]: they had borders, and the borders \[were\] between the ledges:

28: 

[[1Kgs.7.29|29]] And on the borders that \[were\] between the ledges \[were\] lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges \[there was\] a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen \[were\] certain additions made of thin work.

29: 

[[1Kgs.7.30|30]] And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver \[were\] undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.

30: 

[[1Kgs.7.31|31]] And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above \[was\] a cubit: but the mouth thereof \[was\] round \[after\] the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it \[were\] gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.

31: 

[[1Kgs.7.32|32]] And under the borders \[were\] four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels \[were joined\] to the base: and the height of a wheel \[was\] a cubit and half a cubit.

32: 

[[1Kgs.7.33|33]] And the work of the wheels \[was\] like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, \[were\] all molten.

33: 

[[1Kgs.7.34|34]] And \[there were\] four undersetters to the four corners of one base: \[and\] the undersetters \[were\] of the very base itself.

34: 

[[1Kgs.7.35|35]] And in the top of the base \[was there\] a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof \[were\] of the same.

35: 

[[1Kgs.7.36|36]] For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.

36: 

[[1Kgs.7.37|37]] After this \[manner\] he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, \[and\] one size.
