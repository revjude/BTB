[[1Kgs.7|1 Kings 7:23 - 1 Kings 7:26]]
*The Molten Sea*

[[1Kgs.7.23|23]] And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: \[it was\] round all about, and his height \[was\] five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.

23: 

[[1Kgs.7.24|24]] And under the brim of it round about \[there were\] knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops \[were\] cast in two rows, when it was cast.

24: 

[[1Kgs.7.25|25]] It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea \[was set\] above upon them, and all their hinder parts \[were\] inward.

25: 

[[1Kgs.7.26|26]] And it \[was\] an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.
