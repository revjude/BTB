[[1Kgs.20|1 Kings 20:31 - 1 Kings 20:34]]
*Ahab Spares Ben-hadad*

[[1Kgs.20.31|31]] And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel \[are\] merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.

31: 

[[1Kgs.20.32|32]] So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and \[put\] ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, \[Is\] he yet alive? he \[is\] my brother.

32: 

[[1Kgs.20.33|33]] Now the men did diligently observe whether \[any thing would come\] from him, and did hastily catch \[it\]: and they said, Thy brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.

33: 

[[1Kgs.20.34|34]] And \[Benhadad\] said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then \[said Ahab\], I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.

34:
