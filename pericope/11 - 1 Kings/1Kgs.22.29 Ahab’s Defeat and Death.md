[[1Kgs.22|1 Kings 22:29 - 1 Kings 22:40]]
*Ahab’s Defeat and Death*

[[1Kgs.22.29|29]] So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.

29: 

[[1Kgs.22.30|30]] And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.

30: 

[[1Kgs.22.31|31]] But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.

31: 

[[1Kgs.22.32|32]] And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it \[is\] the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.

32: 

[[1Kgs.22.33|33]] And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it \[was\] not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.

33: 

[[1Kgs.22.34|34]] And a \[certain\] man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.

34: 

[[1Kgs.22.35|35]] And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.

35: 

[[1Kgs.22.36|36]] And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.

36: 

[[1Kgs.22.37|37]] So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.

37: 

[[1Kgs.22.38|38]] And \[one\] washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.

38: 

[[1Kgs.22.39|39]] Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, \[are\] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

39: 

[[1Kgs.22.40|40]] So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.

40:
