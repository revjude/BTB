[[1Kgs.15|1 Kings 15:25 - 1 Kings 15:32]]
*Nadab Reigns in Israel*

[[1Kgs.15.25|25]] And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.

25: 

[[1Kgs.15.26|26]] And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.

26: 

[[1Kgs.15.27|27]] And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which \[belonged\] to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.

27: 

[[1Kgs.15.28|28]] Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.

28: 

[[1Kgs.15.29|29]] And it came to pass, when he reigned, \[that\] he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:

29: 

[[1Kgs.15.30|30]] Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.

30: 

[[1Kgs.15.31|31]] Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, \[are\] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

31: 

[[1Kgs.15.32|32]] And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.

32:
