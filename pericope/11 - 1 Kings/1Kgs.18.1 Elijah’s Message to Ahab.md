[[1Kgs.18|1 Kings 18:1 - 1 Kings 18:15]]
*Elijah’s Message to Ahab*

[[1Kgs.18.1|1]] And it came to pass \[after\] many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.

1: 

[[1Kgs.18.2|2]] And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And \[there was\] a sore famine in Samaria.

2: 

[[1Kgs.18.3|3]] And Ahab called Obadiah, which \[was\] the governor of \[his\] house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:

3: 

[[1Kgs.18.4|4]] For it was \[so\], when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)

4: 

[[1Kgs.18.5|5]] And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.

5: 

[[1Kgs.18.6|6]] So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.

6: 

[[1Kgs.18.7|7]] And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, \[Art\] thou that my lord Elijah?

7: 

[[1Kgs.18.8|8]] And he answered him, I \[am\]: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah \[is here\].

8: 

[[1Kgs.18.9|9]] And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?

9: 

[[1Kgs.18.10|10]] \[As\] the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, \[He is\] not \[there\]; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.

10: 

[[1Kgs.18.11|11]] And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah \[is here\].

11: 

[[1Kgs.18.12|12]] And it shall come to pass, \[as soon as\] I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and \[so\] when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.

12: 

[[1Kgs.18.13|13]] Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD’S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?

13: 

[[1Kgs.18.14|14]] And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah \[is here\]: and he shall slay me.

14: 

[[1Kgs.18.15|15]] And Elijah said, \[As\] the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.

15:
