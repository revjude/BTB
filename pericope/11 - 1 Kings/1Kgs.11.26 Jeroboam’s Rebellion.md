[[1Kgs.11|1 Kings 11:26 - 1 Kings 11:40]]
*Jeroboam’s Rebellion*

[[1Kgs.11.26|26]] And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon’s servant, whose mother’s name \[was\] Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up \[his\] hand against the king.

26: 

[[1Kgs.11.27|27]] And this \[was\] the cause that he lifted up \[his\] hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, \[and\] repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.

27: 

[[1Kgs.11.28|28]] And the man Jeroboam \[was\] a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.

28: 

[[1Kgs.11.29|29]] And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two \[were\] alone in the field:

29: 

[[1Kgs.11.30|30]] And Ahijah caught the new garment that \[was\] on him, and rent it \[in\] twelve pieces:

30: 

[[1Kgs.11.31|31]] And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:

31: 

[[1Kgs.11.32|32]] (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)

32: 

[[1Kgs.11.33|33]] Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do \[that which is\] right in mine eyes, and \[to keep\] my statutes and my judgments, as \[did\] David his father.

33: 

[[1Kgs.11.34|34]] Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant’s sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:

34: 

[[1Kgs.11.35|35]] But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it unto thee, \[even\] ten tribes.

35: 

[[1Kgs.11.36|36]] And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.

36: 

[[1Kgs.11.37|37]] And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.

37: 

[[1Kgs.11.38|38]] And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do \[that is\] right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.

38: 

[[1Kgs.11.39|39]] And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.

39: 

[[1Kgs.11.40|40]] Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.

40:
