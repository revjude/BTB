[[1Kgs.11|1 Kings 11:14 - 1 Kings 11:22]]
*Hadad’s Return*

[[1Kgs.11.14|14]] And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he \[was\] of the king’s seed in Edom.

14: 

[[1Kgs.11.15|15]] For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;

15: 

[[1Kgs.11.16|16]] (For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)

16: 

[[1Kgs.11.17|17]] That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad \[being\] yet a little child.

17: 

[[1Kgs.11.18|18]] And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.

18: 

[[1Kgs.11.19|19]] And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.

19: 

[[1Kgs.11.20|20]] And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s household among the sons of Pharaoh.

20: 

[[1Kgs.11.21|21]] And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.

21: 

[[1Kgs.11.22|22]] Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.

22:
