[[1Kgs.16|1 Kings 16:8 - 1 Kings 16:14]]
*Elah Reigns in Israel*

[[1Kgs.16.8|8]] In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.

8: 

[[1Kgs.16.9|9]] And his servant Zimri, captain of half \[his\] chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of \[his\] house in Tirzah.

9: 

[[1Kgs.16.10|10]] And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.

10: 

[[1Kgs.16.11|11]] And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, \[that\] he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.

11: 

[[1Kgs.16.12|12]] Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,

12: 

[[1Kgs.16.13|13]] For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.

13: 

[[1Kgs.16.14|14]] Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, \[are\] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

14:
