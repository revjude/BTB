[[1Kgs.1|1 Kings 1:41 - 1 Kings 1:53]]
*Adonijah Learns of Solomon’s Kingship*

[[1Kgs.1.41|41]] And Adonijah and all the guests that \[were\] with him heard \[it\] as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore \[is this\] noise of the city being in an uproar?

41: 

[[1Kgs.1.42|42]] And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou \[art\] a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.

42: 

[[1Kgs.1.43|43]] And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.

43: 

[[1Kgs.1.44|44]] And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule:

44: 

[[1Kgs.1.45|45]] And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This \[is\] the noise that ye have heard.

45: 

[[1Kgs.1.46|46]] And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.

46: 

[[1Kgs.1.47|47]] And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.

47: 

[[1Kgs.1.48|48]] And also thus said the king, Blessed \[be\] the LORD God of Israel, which hath given \[one\] to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing \[it\].

48: 

[[1Kgs.1.49|49]] And all the guests that \[were\] with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.

49: 

[[1Kgs.1.50|50]] And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.

50: 

[[1Kgs.1.51|51]] And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.

51: 

[[1Kgs.1.52|52]] And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.

52: 

[[1Kgs.1.53|53]] So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.

53:
