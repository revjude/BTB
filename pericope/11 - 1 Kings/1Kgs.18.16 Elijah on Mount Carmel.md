[[1Kgs.18|1 Kings 18:16 - 1 Kings 18:35]]
*Elijah on Mount Carmel*

[[1Kgs.18.16|16]] So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.

16: 

[[1Kgs.18.17|17]] And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, \[Art\] thou he that troubleth Israel?

17: 

[[1Kgs.18.18|18]] And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.

18: 

[[1Kgs.18.19|19]] Now therefore send, \[and\] gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel’s table.

19: 

[[1Kgs.18.20|20]] So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.

20: 

[[1Kgs.18.21|21]] And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD \[be\] God, follow him: but if Baal, \[then\] follow him. And the people answered him not a word.

21: 

[[1Kgs.18.22|22]] Then said Elijah unto the people, I, \[even\] I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal’s prophets \[are\] four hundred and fifty men.

22: 

[[1Kgs.18.23|23]] Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay \[it\] on wood, and put no fire \[under\]: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay \[it\] on wood, and put no fire \[under\]:

23: 

[[1Kgs.18.24|24]] And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.

24: 

[[1Kgs.18.25|25]] And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress \[it\] first; for ye \[are\] many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire \[under\].

25: 

[[1Kgs.18.26|26]] And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed \[it\], and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But \[there was\] no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.

26: 

[[1Kgs.18.27|27]] And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he \[is\] a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, \[or\] peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.

27: 

[[1Kgs.18.28|28]] And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.

28: 

[[1Kgs.18.29|29]] And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the \[time\] of the offering of the \[evening\] sacrifice, that \[there was\] neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.

29: 

[[1Kgs.18.30|30]] And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD \[that was\] broken down.

30: 

[[1Kgs.18.31|31]] And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:

31: 

[[1Kgs.18.32|32]] And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.

32: 

[[1Kgs.18.33|33]] And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid \[him\] on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour \[it\] on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.

33: 

[[1Kgs.18.34|34]] And he said, Do \[it\] the second time. And they did \[it\] the second time. And he said, Do \[it\] the third time. And they did \[it\] the third time.

34: 

[[1Kgs.18.35|35]] And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.

35:
