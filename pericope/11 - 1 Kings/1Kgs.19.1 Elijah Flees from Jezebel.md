[[1Kgs.19|1 Kings 19:1 - 1 Kings 19:8]]
*Elijah Flees from Jezebel*

[[1Kgs.19.1|1]] And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.

1: 

[[1Kgs.19.2|2]] Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do \[to me\], and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.

2: 

[[1Kgs.19.3|3]] And when he saw \[that\], he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which \[belongeth\] to Judah, and left his servant there.

3: 

[[1Kgs.19.4|4]] But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I \[am\] not better than my fathers.

4: 

[[1Kgs.19.5|5]] And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise \[and\] eat.

5: 

[[1Kgs.19.6|6]] And he looked, and, behold, \[there was\] a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.

6: 

[[1Kgs.19.7|7]] And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise \[and\] eat; because the journey \[is\] too great for thee.

7: 

[[1Kgs.19.8|8]] And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.

8:
