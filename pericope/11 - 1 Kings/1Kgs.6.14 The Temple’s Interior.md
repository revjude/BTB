[[1Kgs.6|1 Kings 6:14 - 1 Kings 6:22]]
*The Temple’s Interior*

[[1Kgs.6.14|14]] So Solomon built the house, and finished it.

14: 

[[1Kgs.6.15|15]] And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling: \[and\] he covered \[them\] on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.

15: 

[[1Kgs.6.16|16]] And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built \[them\] for it within, \[even\] for the oracle, \[even\] for the most holy \[place\].

16: 

[[1Kgs.6.17|17]] And the house, that \[is\], the temple before it, was forty cubits \[long\].

17: 

[[1Kgs.6.18|18]] And the cedar of the house within \[was\] carved with knops and open flowers: all \[was\] cedar; there was no stone seen.

18: 

[[1Kgs.6.19|19]] And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.

19: 

[[1Kgs.6.20|20]] And the oracle in the forepart \[was\] twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and \[so\] covered the altar \[which was of\] cedar.

20: 

[[1Kgs.6.21|21]] So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.

21: 

[[1Kgs.6.22|22]] And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that \[was\] by the oracle he overlaid with gold.

22:
