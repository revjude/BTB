[[1Kgs.15|1 Kings 15:1 - 1 Kings 15:8]]
*Abijam Reigns in Judah*

[[1Kgs.15.1|1]] Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah.

1: 

[[1Kgs.15.2|2]] Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name \[was\] Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.

2: 

[[1Kgs.15.3|3]] And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.

3: 

[[1Kgs.15.4|4]] Nevertheless for David’s sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:

4: 

[[1Kgs.15.5|5]] Because David did \[that which was\] right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any \[thing\] that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.

5: 

[[1Kgs.15.6|6]] And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.

6: 

[[1Kgs.15.7|7]] Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, \[are\] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.

7: 

[[1Kgs.15.8|8]] And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.

8:
