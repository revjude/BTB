[[1Kgs.21|1 Kings 21:17 - 1 Kings 21:24]]
*Elijah Denounces Ahab and Jezebel*

[[1Kgs.21.17|17]] And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

17: 

[[1Kgs.21.18|18]] Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which \[is\] in Samaria: behold, \[he is\] in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it.

18: 

[[1Kgs.21.19|19]] And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.

19: 

[[1Kgs.21.20|20]] And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found \[thee\]: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.

20: 

[[1Kgs.21.21|21]] Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,

21: 

[[1Kgs.21.22|22]] And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked \[me\] to anger, and made Israel to sin.

22: 

[[1Kgs.21.23|23]] And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.

23: 

[[1Kgs.21.24|24]] Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.

24:
