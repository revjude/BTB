[[1Kgs.20|1 Kings 20:13 - 1 Kings 20:25]]
*Ahab Defeats Ben-hadad*

[[1Kgs.20.13|13]] And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I \[am\] the LORD.

13: 

[[1Kgs.20.14|14]] And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, \[Even\] by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.

14: 

[[1Kgs.20.15|15]] Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, \[even\] all the children of Israel, \[being\] seven thousand.

15: 

[[1Kgs.20.16|16]] And they went out at noon. But Benhadad \[was\] drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.

16: 

[[1Kgs.20.17|17]] And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria.

17: 

[[1Kgs.20.18|18]] And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.

18: 

[[1Kgs.20.19|19]] So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.

19: 

[[1Kgs.20.20|20]] And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen.

20: 

[[1Kgs.20.21|21]] And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.

21: 

[[1Kgs.20.22|22]] And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.

22: 

[[1Kgs.20.23|23]] And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods \[are\] gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.

23: 

[[1Kgs.20.24|24]] And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:

24: 

[[1Kgs.20.25|25]] And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, \[and\] surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.

25:
