[[1Kgs.21|1 Kings 21:8 - 1 Kings 21:16]]
*Jezebel’s Plot*

[[1Kgs.21.8|8]] So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed \[them\] with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that \[were\] in his city, dwelling with Naboth.

8: 

[[1Kgs.21.9|9]] And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:

9: 

[[1Kgs.21.10|10]] And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And \[then\] carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.

10: 

[[1Kgs.21.11|11]] And the men of his city, \[even\] the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, \[and\] as it \[was\] written in the letters which she had sent unto them.

11: 

[[1Kgs.21.12|12]] They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.

12: 

[[1Kgs.21.13|13]] And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, \[even\] against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.

13: 

[[1Kgs.21.14|14]] Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.

14: 

[[1Kgs.21.15|15]] And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.

15: 

[[1Kgs.21.16|16]] And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.

16:
