[[1Kgs.14|1 Kings 14:21 - 1 Kings 14:24]]
*Rehoboam Reigns in Judah*

[[1Kgs.14.21|21]] And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam \[was\] forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother’s name \[was\] Naamah an Ammonitess.

21: 

[[1Kgs.14.22|22]] And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.

22: 

[[1Kgs.14.23|23]] For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.

23: 

[[1Kgs.14.24|24]] And there were also sodomites in the land: \[and\] they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.

24:
