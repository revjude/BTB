[[1Kgs.11|1 Kings 11:1 - 1 Kings 11:8]]
*Solomon’s Foreign Wives*

[[1Kgs.11.1|1]] But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, \[and\] Hittites;

1: 

[[1Kgs.11.2|2]] Of the nations \[concerning\] which the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: \[for\] surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.

2: 

[[1Kgs.11.3|3]] And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.

3: 

[[1Kgs.11.4|4]] For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, \[that\] his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as \[was\] the heart of David his father.

4: 

[[1Kgs.11.5|5]] For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.

5: 

[[1Kgs.11.6|6]] And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as \[did\] David his father.

6: 

[[1Kgs.11.7|7]] Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that \[is\] before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.

7: 

[[1Kgs.11.8|8]] And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.

8:
