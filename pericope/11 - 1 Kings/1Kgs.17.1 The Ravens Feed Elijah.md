[[1Kgs.17|1 Kings 17:1 - 1 Kings 17:7]]
*The Ravens Feed Elijah*

[[1Kgs.17.1|1]] And Elijah the Tishbite, \[who was\] of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, \[As\] the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.

1: 

[[1Kgs.17.2|2]] And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,

2: 

[[1Kgs.17.3|3]] Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that \[is\] before Jordan.

3: 

[[1Kgs.17.4|4]] And it shall be, \[that\] thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.

4: 

[[1Kgs.17.5|5]] So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that \[is\] before Jordan.

5: 

[[1Kgs.17.6|6]] And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.

6: 

[[1Kgs.17.7|7]] And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.

7:
