[[1Kgs.7|1 Kings 7:1 - 1 Kings 7:12]]
*Solomon’s Palace Complex*

[[1Kgs.7.1|1]] But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.

1: 

[[1Kgs.7.2|2]] He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof \[was\] an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.

2: 

[[1Kgs.7.3|3]] And \[it was\] covered with cedar above upon the beams, that \[lay\] on forty five pillars, fifteen \[in\] a row.

3: 

[[1Kgs.7.4|4]] And \[there were\] windows \[in\] three rows, and light \[was\] against light \[in\] three ranks.

4: 

[[1Kgs.7.5|5]] And all the doors and posts \[were\] square, with the windows: and light \[was\] against light \[in\] three ranks.

5: 

[[1Kgs.7.6|6]] And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof \[was\] fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch \[was\] before them: and the \[other\] pillars and the thick beam \[were\] before them.

6: 

[[1Kgs.7.7|7]] Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, \[even\] the porch of judgment: and \[it was\] covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.

7: 

[[1Kgs.7.8|8]] And his house where he dwelt \[had\] another court within the porch, \[which\] was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had taken \[to wife\], like unto this porch.

8: 

[[1Kgs.7.9|9]] All these \[were of\] costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and \[so\] on the outside toward the great court.

9: 

[[1Kgs.7.10|10]] And the foundation \[was of\] costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.

10: 

[[1Kgs.7.11|11]] And above \[were\] costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.

11: 

[[1Kgs.7.12|12]] And the great court round about \[was\] with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.

12:
