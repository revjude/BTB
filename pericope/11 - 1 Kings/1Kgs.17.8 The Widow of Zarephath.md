[[1Kgs.17|1 Kings 17:8 - 1 Kings 17:16]]
*The Widow of Zarephath*

[[1Kgs.17.8|8]] And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,

8: 

[[1Kgs.17.9|9]] Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which \[belongeth\] to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.

9: 

[[1Kgs.17.10|10]] So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman \[was\] there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.

10: 

[[1Kgs.17.11|11]] And as she was going to fetch \[it\], he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.

11: 

[[1Kgs.17.12|12]] And she said, \[As\] the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I \[am\] gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.

12: 

[[1Kgs.17.13|13]] And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go \[and\] do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring \[it\] unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.

13: 

[[1Kgs.17.14|14]] For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day \[that\] the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.

14: 

[[1Kgs.17.15|15]] And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat \[many\] days.

15: 

[[1Kgs.17.16|16]] \[And\] the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.

16:
