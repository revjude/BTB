[[1Kgs.19|1 Kings 19:19 - 1 Kings 19:21]]
*The Call of Elisha*

[[1Kgs.19.19|19]] So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who \[was\] plowing \[with\] twelve yoke \[of oxen\] before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.

19: 

[[1Kgs.19.20|20]] And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and \[then\] I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?

20: 

[[1Kgs.19.21|21]] And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.
