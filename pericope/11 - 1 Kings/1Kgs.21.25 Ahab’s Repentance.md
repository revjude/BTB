[[1Kgs.21|1 Kings 21:25 - 1 Kings 21:29]]
*Ahab’s Repentance*

[[1Kgs.21.25|25]] But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.

25: 

[[1Kgs.21.26|26]] And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all \[things\] as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.

26: 

[[1Kgs.21.27|27]] And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.

27: 

[[1Kgs.21.28|28]] And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

28: 

[[1Kgs.21.29|29]] Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: \[but\] in his son’s days will I bring the evil upon his house.

29:
