[[1Kgs.18|1 Kings 18:41 - 1 Kings 18:46]]
*The LORD Sends Rain*

[[1Kgs.18.41|41]] And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for \[there is\] a sound of abundance of rain.

41: 

[[1Kgs.18.42|42]] So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,

42: 

[[1Kgs.18.43|43]] And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, \[There is\] nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.

43: 

[[1Kgs.18.44|44]] And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare \[thy chariot\], and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.

44: 

[[1Kgs.18.45|45]] And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.

45: 

[[1Kgs.18.46|46]] And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.

46:
