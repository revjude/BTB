[[1Kgs.20|1 Kings 20:35 - 1 Kings 20:43]]
*A Prophet Reproves Ahab*

[[1Kgs.20.35|35]] And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.

35: 

[[1Kgs.20.36|36]] Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.

36: 

[[1Kgs.20.37|37]] Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded \[him\].

37: 

[[1Kgs.20.38|38]] So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.

38: 

[[1Kgs.20.39|39]] And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.

39: 

[[1Kgs.20.40|40]] And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So \[shall\] thy judgment \[be\]; thyself hast decided \[it\].

40: 

[[1Kgs.20.41|41]] And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he \[was\] of the prophets.

41: 

[[1Kgs.20.42|42]] And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of \[thy\] hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.

42: 

[[1Kgs.20.43|43]] And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.

43:
