[[1Kgs.5|1 Kings 5:7 - 1 Kings 5:12]]
*Hiram’s Reply to Solomon*

[[1Kgs.5.7|7]] And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed \[be\] the LORD this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.

7: 

[[1Kgs.5.8|8]] And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: \[and\] I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.

8: 

[[1Kgs.5.9|9]] My servants shall bring \[them\] down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive \[them\]: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.

9: 

[[1Kgs.5.10|10]] So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees \[according to\] all his desire.

10: 

[[1Kgs.5.11|11]] And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat \[for\] food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.

11: 

[[1Kgs.5.12|12]] And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.

12:
