[[1Kgs.22|1 Kings 22:1 - 1 Kings 22:12]]
*Ahab and the False Prophets*

[[1Kgs.22.1|1]] And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.

1: 

[[1Kgs.22.2|2]] And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.

2: 

[[1Kgs.22.3|3]] And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead \[is\] ours, and we \[be\] still, \[and\] take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?

3: 

[[1Kgs.22.4|4]] And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I \[am\] as thou \[art\], my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.

4: 

[[1Kgs.22.5|5]] And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.

5: 

[[1Kgs.22.6|6]] Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver \[it\] into the hand of the king.

6: 

[[1Kgs.22.7|7]] And Jehoshaphat said, \[Is there\] not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might inquire of him?

7: 

[[1Kgs.22.8|8]] And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, \[There is\] yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.

8: 

[[1Kgs.22.9|9]] Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten \[hither\] Micaiah the son of Imlah.

9: 

[[1Kgs.22.10|10]] And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.

10: 

[[1Kgs.22.11|11]] And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.

11: 

[[1Kgs.22.12|12]] And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver \[it\] into the king’s hand.

12:
