[[1Kgs.20|1 Kings 20:1 - 1 Kings 20:12]]
*Ben-hadad Attacks Samaria*

[[1Kgs.20.1|1]] And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and \[there were\] thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.

1: 

[[1Kgs.20.2|2]] And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad,

2: 

[[1Kgs.20.3|3]] Thy silver and thy gold \[is\] mine; thy wives also and thy children, \[even\] the goodliest, \[are\] mine.

3: 

[[1Kgs.20.4|4]] And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I \[am\] thine, and all that I have.

4: 

[[1Kgs.20.5|5]] And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;

5: 

[[1Kgs.20.6|6]] Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, \[that\] whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put \[it\] in their hand, and take \[it\] away.

6: 

[[1Kgs.20.7|7]] Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this \[man\] seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.

7: 

[[1Kgs.20.8|8]] And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not \[unto him\], nor consent.

8: 

[[1Kgs.20.9|9]] Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.

9: 

[[1Kgs.20.10|10]] And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.

10: 

[[1Kgs.20.11|11]] And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell \[him\], Let not him that girdeth on \[his harness\] boast himself as he that putteth it off.

11: 

[[1Kgs.20.12|12]] And it came to pass, when \[Benhadad\] heard this message, as he \[was\] drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set \[yourselves in array\]. And they set \[themselves in array\] against the city.

12:
