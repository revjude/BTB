[[1Kgs.7|1 Kings 7:48 - 1 Kings 7:51]]
*Completion of the Gold Furnishings*

[[1Kgs.7.48|48]] And Solomon made all the vessels that \[pertained\] unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread \[was\],

48: 

[[1Kgs.7.49|49]] And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right \[side\], and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs \[of\] gold,

49: 

[[1Kgs.7.50|50]] And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers \[of\] pure gold; and the hinges \[of\] gold, \[both\] for the doors of the inner house, the most holy \[place, and\] for the doors of the house, \[to wit\], of the temple.

50: 

[[1Kgs.7.51|51]] So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; \[even\] the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.

51:
