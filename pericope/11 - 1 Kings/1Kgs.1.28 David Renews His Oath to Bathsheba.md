[[1Kgs.1|1 Kings 1:28 - 1 Kings 1:31]]
*David Renews His Oath to Bathsheba*

[[1Kgs.1.28|28]] Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.

28: 

[[1Kgs.1.29|29]] And the king sware, and said, \[As\] the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,

29: 

[[1Kgs.1.30|30]] Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.

30: 

[[1Kgs.1.31|31]] Then Bathsheba bowed with \[her\] face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.

31:
