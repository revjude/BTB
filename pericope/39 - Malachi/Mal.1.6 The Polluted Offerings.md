[[Mal.1|Malachi 1:6 - Malachi 1:14]]
*The Polluted Offerings*

[[Mal.1.6|6]] A son honoureth \[his\] father, and a servant his master: if then I \[be\] a father, where \[is\] mine honour? and if I \[be\] a master, where \[is\] my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?

6: 

[[Mal.1.7|7]] Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD \[is\] contemptible.

7: 

[[Mal.1.8|8]] And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, \[is it\] not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, \[is it\] not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.

8: 

[[Mal.1.9|9]] And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.

9: 

[[Mal.1.10|10]] Who \[is there\] even among you that would shut the doors \[for nought\]? neither do ye kindle \[fire\] on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.

10: 

[[Mal.1.11|11]] For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name \[shall be\] great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense \[shall be\] offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name \[shall be\] great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.

11: 

[[Mal.1.12|12]] But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD \[is\] polluted; and the fruit thereof, \[even\] his meat, \[is\] contemptible.

12: 

[[Mal.1.13|13]] Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness \[is it\]! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought \[that which was\] torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.

13: 

[[Mal.1.14|14]] But cursed \[be\] the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I \[am\] a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name \[is\] dreadful among the heathen.

14:
