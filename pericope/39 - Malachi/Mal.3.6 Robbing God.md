[[Mal.3|Malachi 3:6 - Malachi 3:12]]
*Robbing God*

[[Mal.3.6|6]] For I \[am\] the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.

6: 

[[Mal.3.7|7]] Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept \[them\]. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?

7: 

[[Mal.3.8|8]] Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.

8: 

[[Mal.3.9|9]] Ye \[are\] cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, \[even\] this whole nation.

9: 

[[Mal.3.10|10]] Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that \[there shall\] not \[be room\] enough \[to receive it\].

10: 

[[Mal.3.11|11]] And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.

11: 

[[Mal.3.12|12]] And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.

12:
