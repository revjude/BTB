[[Mal.2|Malachi 2:1 - Malachi 2:9]]
*A Warning to the Priests*

[[Mal.2.1|1]] And now, O ye priests, this commandment \[is\] for you.

1: 

[[Mal.2.2|2]] If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay \[it\] to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay \[it\] to heart.

2: 

[[Mal.2.3|3]] Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, \[even\] the dung of your solemn feasts; and \[one\] shall take you away with it.

3: 

[[Mal.2.4|4]] And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.

4: 

[[Mal.2.5|5]] My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him \[for\] the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.

5: 

[[Mal.2.6|6]] The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.

6: 

[[Mal.2.7|7]] For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he \[is\] the messenger of the LORD of hosts.

7: 

[[Mal.2.8|8]] But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.

8: 

[[Mal.2.9|9]] Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.

9:
