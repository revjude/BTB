[[Mal.3|Malachi 3:13 - Malachi 3:18]]
*The Book of Remembrance*

[[Mal.3.13|13]] Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken \[so much\] against thee?

13: 

[[Mal.3.14|14]] Ye have said, It \[is\] vain to serve God: and what profit \[is it\] that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts?

14: 

[[Mal.3.15|15]] And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, \[they that\] tempt God are even delivered.

15: 

[[Mal.3.16|16]] Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard \[it\], and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.

16: 

[[Mal.3.17|17]] And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.

17: 

[[Mal.3.18|18]] Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.

18:
