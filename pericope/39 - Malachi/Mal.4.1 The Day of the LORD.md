[[Mal.4|Malachi 4:1 - Malachi 4:6]]
*The Day of the LORD*

[[Mal.4.1|1]] For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.

1: 

[[Mal.4.2|2]] But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.

2: 

[[Mal.4.3|3]] And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do \[this\], saith the LORD of hosts.

3: 

[[Mal.4.4|4]] Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, \[with\] the statutes and judgments.

4: 

[[Mal.4.5|5]] Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:

5: 

[[Mal.4.6|6]] And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.

6:
