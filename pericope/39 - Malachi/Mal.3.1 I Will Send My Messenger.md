[[Mal.3|Malachi 3:1 - Malachi 3:5]]
*I Will Send My Messenger*

[[Mal.3.1|1]] Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.

1: 

[[Mal.3.2|2]] But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he \[is\] like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ soap:

2: 

[[Mal.3.3|3]] And he shall sit \[as\] a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.

3: 

[[Mal.3.4|4]] Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.

4: 

[[Mal.3.5|5]] And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in \[his\] wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger \[from his right\], and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.

5:
