[[Mal.2|Malachi 2:10 - Malachi 2:17]]
*Judah’s Unfaithfulness*

[[Mal.2.10|10]] Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?

10: 

[[Mal.2.11|11]] Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.

11: 

[[Mal.2.12|12]] The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts.

12: 

[[Mal.2.13|13]] And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth \[it\] with good will at your hand.

13: 

[[Mal.2.14|14]] Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet \[is\] she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.

14: 

[[Mal.2.15|15]] And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.

15: 

[[Mal.2.16|16]] For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: for \[one\] covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.

16: 

[[Mal.2.17|17]] Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied \[him\]? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil \[is\] good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where \[is\] the God of judgment?

17:
