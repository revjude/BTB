[[Col.1|Colossians 1:3 - Colossians 1:14]]
*Thanksgiving and Prayer*

[[Col.1.3|3]] We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,

3: 

[[Col.1.4|4]] Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love \[which ye have\] to all the saints,

4: 

[[Col.1.5|5]] For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;

5: 

[[Col.1.6|6]] Which is come unto you, as \[it is\] in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as \[it doth\] also in you, since the day ye heard \[of it\], and knew the grace of God in truth:

6: 

[[Col.1.7|7]] As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;

7: 

[[Col.1.8|8]] Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.

8: 

[[Col.1.9|9]] For this cause we also, since the day we heard \[it\], do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;

9: 

[[Col.1.10|10]] That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;

10: 

[[Col.1.11|11]] Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;

11: 

[[Col.1.12|12]] Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:

12: 

[[Col.1.13|13]] Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated \[us\] into the kingdom of his dear Son:

13: 

[[Col.1.14|14]] In whom we have redemption through his blood, \[even\] the forgiveness of sins:

14:
