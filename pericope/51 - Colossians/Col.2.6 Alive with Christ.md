[[Col.2|Colossians 2:6 - Colossians 2:23]]
*Alive with Christ*

[[Col.2.6|6]] As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, \[so\] walk ye in him:

6: 

[[Col.2.7|7]] Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.

7: 

[[Col.2.8|8]] Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.

8: 

[[Col.2.9|9]] For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.

9: 

[[Col.2.10|10]] And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:

10: 

[[Col.2.11|11]] In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:

11: 

[[Col.2.12|12]] Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with \[him\] through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.

12: 

[[Col.2.13|13]] And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;

13: 

[[Col.2.14|14]] Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;

14: 

[[Col.2.15|15]] \[And\] having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.

15: 

[[Col.2.16|16]] Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath \[days\]:

16: 

[[Col.2.17|17]] Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body \[is\] of Christ.

17: 

[[Col.2.18|18]] Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,

18: 

[[Col.2.19|19]] And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.

19: 

[[Col.2.20|20]] Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,

20: 

[[Col.2.21|21]] (Touch not; taste not; handle not;

21: 

[[Col.2.22|22]] Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?

22: 

[[Col.2.23|23]] Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.

23:
