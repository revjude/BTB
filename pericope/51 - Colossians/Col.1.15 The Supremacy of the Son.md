[[Col.1|Colossians 1:15 - Colossians 1:23]]
*The Supremacy of the Son*

[[Col.1.15|15]] Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:

15: 

[[Col.1.16|16]] For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether \[they be\] thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:

16: 

[[Col.1.17|17]] And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.

17: 

[[Col.1.18|18]] And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all \[things\] he might have the preeminence.

18: 

[[Col.1.19|19]] For it pleased \[the Father\] that in him should all fulness dwell;

19: 

[[Col.1.20|20]] And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, \[I say\], whether \[they be\] things in earth, or things in heaven.

20: 

[[Col.1.21|21]] And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in \[your\] mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled

21: 

[[Col.1.22|22]] In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:

22: 

[[Col.1.23|23]] If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and \[be\] not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, \[and\] which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;

23:
