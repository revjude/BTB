[[Col.3|Colossians 3:22 - Colossians 3:25]]
*Serving with Honor*

[[Col.3.22|22]] Servants, obey in all things \[your\] masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:

22: 

[[Col.3.23|23]] And whatsoever ye do, do \[it\] heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;

23: 

[[Col.3.24|24]] Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.

24: 

[[Col.3.25|25]] But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.

25:
