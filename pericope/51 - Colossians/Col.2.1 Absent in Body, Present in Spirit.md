[[Col.2|Colossians 2:1 - Colossians 2:5]]
*Absent in Body, Present in Spirit*

[[Col.2.1|1]] For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and \[for\] them at Laodicea, and \[for\] as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;

1: 

[[Col.2.2|2]] That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;

2: 

[[Col.2.3|3]] In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

3: 

[[Col.2.4|4]] And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.

4: 

[[Col.2.5|5]] For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.

5:
