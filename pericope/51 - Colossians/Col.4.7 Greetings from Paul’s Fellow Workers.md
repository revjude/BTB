[[Col.4|Colossians 4:7 - Colossians 4:14]]
*Greetings from Paul’s Fellow Workers*

[[Col.4.7|7]] All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, \[who is\] a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:

7: 

[[Col.4.8|8]] Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;

8: 

[[Col.4.9|9]] With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is \[one\] of you. They shall make known unto you all things which \[are done\] here.

9: 

[[Col.4.10|10]] Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister’s son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)

10: 

[[Col.4.11|11]] And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only \[are my\] fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.

11: 

[[Col.4.12|12]] Epaphras, who is \[one\] of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.

12: 

[[Col.4.13|13]] For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them \[that are\] in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.

13: 

[[Col.4.14|14]] Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.

14:
