[[Col.3|Colossians 3:1 - Colossians 3:17]]
*Put On the New Self*

[[Col.3.1|1]] If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.

1: 

[[Col.3.2|2]] Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.

2: 

[[Col.3.3|3]] For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.

3: 

[[Col.3.4|4]] When Christ, \[who is\] our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.

4: 

[[Col.3.5|5]] Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:

5: 

[[Col.3.6|6]] For which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:

6: 

[[Col.3.7|7]] In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.

7: 

[[Col.3.8|8]] But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.

8: 

[[Col.3.9|9]] Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;

9: 

[[Col.3.10|10]] And have put on the new \[man\], which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:

10: 

[[Col.3.11|11]] Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond \[nor\] free: but Christ \[is\] all, and in all.

11: 

[[Col.3.12|12]] Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;

12: 

[[Col.3.13|13]] Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also \[do\] ye.

13: 

[[Col.3.14|14]] And above all these things \[put on\] charity, which is the bond of perfectness.

14: 

[[Col.3.15|15]] And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.

15: 

[[Col.3.16|16]] Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

16: 

[[Col.3.17|17]] And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, \[do\] all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.

17:
