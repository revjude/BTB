[[Obad.1|Obadiah 1:1 - Obadiah 1:14]]
*The Destruction of Edom*

[[Obad.1.1|1]] The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.

1: 

[[Obad.1.2|2]] Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly despised.

2: 

[[Obad.1.3|3]] The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation \[is\] high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?

3: 

[[Obad.1.4|4]] Though thou exalt \[thyself\] as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD.

4: 

[[Obad.1.5|5]] If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave \[some\] grapes?

5: 

[[Obad.1.6|6]] How are \[the things\] of Esau searched out! \[how\] are his hidden things sought up!

6: 

[[Obad.1.7|7]] All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee \[even\] to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, \[and\] prevailed against thee; \[they that eat\] thy bread have laid a wound under thee: \[there is\] none understanding in him.

7: 

[[Obad.1.8|8]] Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise \[men\] out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?

8: 

[[Obad.1.9|9]] And thy mighty \[men\], O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.

9: 

[[Obad.1.10|10]] For \[thy\] violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.

10: 

[[Obad.1.11|11]] In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou \[wast\] as one of them.

11: 

[[Obad.1.12|12]] But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.

12: 

[[Obad.1.13|13]] Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid \[hands\] on their substance in the day of their calamity;

13: 

[[Obad.1.14|14]] Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress.

14:
