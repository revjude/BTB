[[Obad.1|Obadiah 1:15 - Obadiah 1:21]]
*The Deliverance of Israel*

[[Obad.1.15|15]] For the day of the LORD \[is\] near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head.

15: 

[[Obad.1.16|16]] For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, \[so\] shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.

16: 

[[Obad.1.17|17]] But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.

17: 

[[Obad.1.18|18]] And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be \[any\] remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken \[it\].

18: 

[[Obad.1.19|19]] And \[they of\] the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and \[they of\] the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin \[shall possess\] Gilead.

19: 

[[Obad.1.20|20]] And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel \[shall possess\] that of the Canaanites, \[even\] unto Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem, which \[is\] in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south.

20: 

[[Obad.1.21|21]] And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD’S.

21:
