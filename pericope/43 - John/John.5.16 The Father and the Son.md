[[John.5|John 5:16 - John 5:30]]
*The Father and the Son*

[[John.5.16|16]] And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.

16: 

[[John.5.17|17]] But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.

17: 

[[John.5.18|18]] Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.

18: 

[[John.5.19|19]] Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.

19: 

[[John.5.20|20]] For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.

20: 

[[John.5.21|21]] For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth \[them\]; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.

21: 

[[John.5.22|22]] For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:

22: 

[[John.5.23|23]] That all \[men\] should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.

23: 

[[John.5.24|24]] Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.

24: 

[[John.5.25|25]] Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.

25: 

[[John.5.26|26]] For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;

26: 

[[John.5.27|27]] And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.

27: 

[[John.5.28|28]] Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,

28: 

[[John.5.29|29]] And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.

29: 

[[John.5.30|30]] I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.

30:
