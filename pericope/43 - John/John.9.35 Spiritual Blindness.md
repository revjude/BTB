[[John.9|John 9:35 - John 9:41]]
*Spiritual Blindness*

[[John.9.35|35]] Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?

35: 

[[John.9.36|36]] He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?

36: 

[[John.9.37|37]] And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.

37: 

[[John.9.38|38]] And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.

38: 

[[John.9.39|39]] And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.

39: 

[[John.9.40|40]] And \[some\] of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?

40: 

[[John.9.41|41]] Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.

41:
