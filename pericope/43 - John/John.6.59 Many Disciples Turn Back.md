[[John.6|John 6:59 - John 6:66]]
*Many Disciples Turn Back*

[[John.6.59|59]] These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.

59: 

[[John.6.60|60]] Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard \[this\], said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?

60: 

[[John.6.61|61]] When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?

61: 

[[John.6.62|62]] \[What\] and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?

62: 

[[John.6.63|63]] It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, \[they\] are spirit, and \[they\] are life.

63: 

[[John.6.64|64]] But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.

64: 

[[John.6.65|65]] And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.

65: 

[[John.6.66|66]] From that \[time\] many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.

66:
