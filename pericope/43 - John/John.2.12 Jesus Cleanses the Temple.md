[[John.2|John 2:12 - John 2:25]]
*Jesus Cleanses the Temple*

[[John.2.12|12]] After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.

12: 

[[John.2.13|13]] And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,

13: 

[[John.2.14|14]] And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:

14: 

[[John.2.15|15]] And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables;

15: 

[[John.2.16|16]] And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.

16: 

[[John.2.17|17]] And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.

17: 

[[John.2.18|18]] Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?

18: 

[[John.2.19|19]] Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.

19: 

[[John.2.20|20]] Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?

20: 

[[John.2.21|21]] But he spake of the temple of his body.

21: 

[[John.2.22|22]] When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.

22: 

[[John.2.23|23]] Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast \[day\], many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.

23: 

[[John.2.24|24]] But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all \[men\],

24: 

[[John.2.25|25]] And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.

25:
