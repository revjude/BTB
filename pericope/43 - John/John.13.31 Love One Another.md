[[John.13|John 13:31 - John 13:35]]
*Love One Another*

[[John.13.31|31]] Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.

31: 

[[John.13.32|32]] If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.

32: 

[[John.13.33|33]] Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.

33: 

[[John.13.34|34]] A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.

34: 

[[John.13.35|35]] By this shall all \[men\] know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.

35:
