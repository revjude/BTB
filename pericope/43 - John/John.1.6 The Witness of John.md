[[John.1|John 1:6 - John 1:13]]
*The Witness of John*

[[John.1.6|6]] There was a man sent from God, whose name \[was\] John.

6: 

[[John.1.7|7]] The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all \[men\] through him might believe.

7: 

[[John.1.8|8]] He was not that Light, but \[was sent\] to bear witness of that Light.

8: 

[[John.1.9|9]] \[That\] was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.

9: 

[[John.1.10|10]] He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.

10: 

[[John.1.11|11]] He came unto his own, and his own received him not.

11: 

[[John.1.12|12]] But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, \[even\] to them that believe on his name:

12: 

[[John.1.13|13]] Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

13:
