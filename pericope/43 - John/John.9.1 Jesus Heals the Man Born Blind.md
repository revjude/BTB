[[John.9|John 9:1 - John 9:12]]
*Jesus Heals the Man Born Blind*

[[John.9.1|1]] And as \[Jesus\] passed by, he saw a man which was blind from \[his\] birth.

1: 

[[John.9.2|2]] And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?

2: 

[[John.9.3|3]] Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.

3: 

[[John.9.4|4]] I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.

4: 

[[John.9.5|5]] As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.

5: 

[[John.9.6|6]] When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,

6: 

[[John.9.7|7]] And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.

7: 

[[John.9.8|8]] The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?

8: 

[[John.9.9|9]] Some said, This is he: others \[said\], He is like him: \[but\] he said, I am \[he\].

9: 

[[John.9.10|10]] Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?

10: 

[[John.9.11|11]] He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.

11: 

[[John.9.12|12]] Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.

12:
