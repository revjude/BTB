[[John.15|John 15:9 - John 15:17]]
*No Greater Love*

[[John.15.9|9]] As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.

9: 

[[John.15.10|10]] If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.

10: 

[[John.15.11|11]] These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and \[that\] your joy might be full.

11: 

[[John.15.12|12]] This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.

12: 

[[John.15.13|13]] Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.

13: 

[[John.15.14|14]] Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.

14: 

[[John.15.15|15]] Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.

15: 

[[John.15.16|16]] Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and \[that\] your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.

16: 

[[John.15.17|17]] These things I command you, that ye love one another.

17:
