[[John.8|John 8:12 - John 8:29]]
*Jesus the Light of the World*

[[John.8.12|12]] Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.

12: 

[[John.8.13|13]] The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.

13: 

[[John.8.14|14]] Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, \[yet\] my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.

14: 

[[John.8.15|15]] Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.

15: 

[[John.8.16|16]] And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.

16: 

[[John.8.17|17]] It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.

17: 

[[John.8.18|18]] I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.

18: 

[[John.8.19|19]] Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.

19: 

[[John.8.20|20]] These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.

20: 

[[John.8.21|21]] Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.

21: 

[[John.8.22|22]] Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.

22: 

[[John.8.23|23]] And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.

23: 

[[John.8.24|24]] I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am \[he\], ye shall die in your sins.

24: 

[[John.8.25|25]] Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even \[the same\] that I said unto you from the beginning.

25: 

[[John.8.26|26]] I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.

26: 

[[John.8.27|27]] They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.

27: 

[[John.8.28|28]] Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am \[he\], and \[that\] I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.

28: 

[[John.8.29|29]] And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.
