[[John.7|John 7:25 - John 7:36]]
*Is Jesus the Christ？*

[[John.7.25|25]] Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?

25: 

[[John.7.26|26]] But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?

26: 

[[John.7.27|27]] Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.

27: 

[[John.7.28|28]] Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.

28: 

[[John.7.29|29]] But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.

29: 

[[John.7.30|30]] Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.

30: 

[[John.7.31|31]] And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this \[man\] hath done?

31: 

[[John.7.32|32]] The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.

32: 

[[John.7.33|33]] Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and \[then\] I go unto him that sent me.

33: 

[[John.7.34|34]] Ye shall seek me, and shall not find \[me\]: and where I am, \[thither\] ye cannot come.

34: 

[[John.7.35|35]] Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?

35: 

[[John.7.36|36]] What \[manner of\] saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find \[me\]: and where I am, \[thither\] ye cannot come?
