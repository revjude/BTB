[[John.15|John 15:18 - John 15:27]]
*The Hatred of the World*

[[John.15.18|18]] If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before \[it hated\] you.

18: 

[[John.15.19|19]] If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.

19: 

[[John.15.20|20]] Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.

20: 

[[John.15.21|21]] But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.

21: 

[[John.15.22|22]] If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin.

22: 

[[John.15.23|23]] He that hateth me hateth my Father also.

23: 

[[John.15.24|24]] If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.

24: 

[[John.15.25|25]] But \[this cometh to pass\], that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.

25: 

[[John.15.26|26]] But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, \[even\] the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:

26: 

[[John.15.27|27]] And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.

27:
