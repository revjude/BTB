[[John.4|John 4:43 - John 4:54]]
*Jesus Heals the Official’s Son*

[[John.4.43|43]] Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.

43: 

[[John.4.44|44]] For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.

44: 

[[John.4.45|45]] Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.

45: 

[[John.4.46|46]] So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.

46: 

[[John.4.47|47]] When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.

47: 

[[John.4.48|48]] Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.

48: 

[[John.4.49|49]] The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.

49: 

[[John.4.50|50]] Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.

50: 

[[John.4.51|51]] And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told \[him\], saying, Thy son liveth.

51: 

[[John.4.52|52]] Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.

52: 

[[John.4.53|53]] So the father knew that \[it was\] at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.

53: 

[[John.4.54|54]] This \[is\] again the second miracle \[that\] Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.

54:
