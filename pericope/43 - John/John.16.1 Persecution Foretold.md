[[John.16|John 16:1 - John 16:4]]
*Persecution Foretold*

[[John.16.1|1]] These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.

1: 

[[John.16.2|2]] They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.

2: 

[[John.16.3|3]] And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.

3: 

[[John.16.4|4]] But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.

4:
