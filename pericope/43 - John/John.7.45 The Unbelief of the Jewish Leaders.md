46: 

[[John.7.47|47]] Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?

47: 

[[John.7.48|48]] Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?

[[John.7.51|51]] Doth our law judge \[any\] man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?

[[John.7.52|52]] They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.

52: 

[[John.7.53|53]] And every man went unto his own house.
