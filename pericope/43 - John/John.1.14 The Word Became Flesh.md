[[John.1|John 1:14 - John 1:18]]
*The Word Became Flesh*

[[John.1.14|14]] And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

14: 

[[John.1.15|15]] John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.

15: 

[[John.1.16|16]] And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.

16: 

[[John.1.17|17]] For the law was given by Moses, \[but\] grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.

17: 

[[John.1.18|18]] No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared \[him\].

18:
