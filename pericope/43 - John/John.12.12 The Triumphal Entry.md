*The Triumphal Entry*

[[John.12.12|12]] On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,

12: 

[[John.12.13|13]] Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed \[is\] the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.

13: 

[[John.12.14|14]] And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,

14: 

[[John.12.15|15]] Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.

15: 

[[John.12.16|16]] These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and \[that\] they had done these things unto him.

16: 

[[John.12.17|17]] The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.

17: 

[[John.12.18|18]] For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.

18: 

[[John.12.19|19]] The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.
