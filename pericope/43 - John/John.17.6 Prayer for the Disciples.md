[[John.17|John 17:6 - John 17:19]]
*Prayer for the Disciples*

[[John.17.6|6]] I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.

6: 

[[John.17.7|7]] Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.

7: 

[[John.17.8|8]] For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received \[them\], and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.

8: 

[[John.17.9|9]] I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.

9: 

[[John.17.10|10]] And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.

10: 

[[John.17.11|11]] And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we \[are\].

11: 

[[John.17.12|12]] While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.

12: 

[[John.17.13|13]] And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.

13: 

[[John.17.14|14]] I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

14: 

[[John.17.15|15]] I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.

15: 

[[John.17.16|16]] They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

16: 

[[John.17.17|17]] Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.

17: 

[[John.17.18|18]] As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.

18: 

[[John.17.19|19]] And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.

19:
