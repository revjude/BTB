[[John.20|John 20:10 - John 20:18]]
*Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene*

[[John.20.10|10]] Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.

10: 

[[John.20.11|11]] But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, \[and looked\] into the sepulchre,

11: 

[[John.20.12|12]] And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.

12: 

[[John.20.13|13]] And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.

13: 

[[John.20.14|14]] And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.

14: 

[[John.20.15|15]] Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.

15: 

[[John.20.16|16]] Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.

16: 

[[John.20.17|17]] Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and \[to\] my God, and your God.

17: 

[[John.20.18|18]] Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and \[that\] he had spoken these things unto her.
