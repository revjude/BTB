[[John.4|John 4:1 - John 4:26]]
*Jesus and the Samaritan Woman*

[[John.4.1|1]] When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,

1: 

[[John.4.2|2]] (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)

2: 

[[John.4.3|3]] He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.

3: 

[[John.4.4|4]] And he must needs go through Samaria.

4: 

[[John.4.5|5]] Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

5: 

[[John.4.6|6]] Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with \[his\] journey, sat thus on the well: \[and\] it was about the sixth hour.

6: 

[[John.4.7|7]] There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.

7: 

[[John.4.8|8]] (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)

8: 

[[John.4.9|9]] Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.

9: 

[[John.4.10|10]] Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.

10: 

[[John.4.11|11]] The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?

11: 

[[John.4.12|12]] Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?

12: 

[[John.4.13|13]] Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:

13: 

[[John.4.14|14]] But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.

14: 

[[John.4.15|15]] The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.

15: 

[[John.4.16|16]] Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.

16: 

[[John.4.17|17]] The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:

17: 

[[John.4.18|18]] For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.

18: 

[[John.4.19|19]] The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.

19: 

[[John.4.20|20]] Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.

20: 

[[John.4.21|21]] Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.

21: 

[[John.4.22|22]] Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.

22: 

[[John.4.23|23]] But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.

23: 

[[John.4.24|24]] God \[is\] a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship \[him\] in spirit and in truth.

24: 

[[John.4.25|25]] The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.

25: 

[[John.4.26|26]] Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am \[he\].

26:
