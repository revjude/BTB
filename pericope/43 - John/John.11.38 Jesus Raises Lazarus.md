[[John.11|John 11:38 - John 11:44]]
*Jesus Raises Lazarus*

[[John.11.38|38]] Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.

38: 

[[John.11.39|39]] Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been \[dead\] four days.

39: 

[[John.11.40|40]] Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?

40: 

[[John.11.41|41]] Then they took away the stone \[from the place\] where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up \[his\] eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.

41: 

[[John.11.42|42]] And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said \[it\], that they may believe that thou hast sent me.

42: 

[[John.11.43|43]] And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.

43: 

[[John.11.44|44]] And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.

44:
