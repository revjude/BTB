[[John.15|John 15:1 - John 15:8]]
*Jesus the True Vine*

[[John.15.1|1]] I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.

1: 

[[John.15.2|2]] Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every \[branch\] that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.

2: 

[[John.15.3|3]] Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.

3: 

[[John.15.4|4]] Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.

4: 

[[John.15.5|5]] I am the vine, ye \[are\] the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.

5: 

[[John.15.6|6]] If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast \[them\] into the fire, and they are burned.

6: 

[[John.15.7|7]] If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.

7: 

[[John.15.8|8]] Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.

8:
