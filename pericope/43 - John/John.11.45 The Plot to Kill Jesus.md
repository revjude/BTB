[[John.11|John 11:45 - John 11:57]]
*The Plot to Kill Jesus*

[[John.11.45|45]] Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.

45: 

[[John.11.46|46]] But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.

46: 

[[John.11.47|47]] Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.

47: 

[[John.11.48|48]] If we let him thus alone, all \[men\] will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.

48: 

[[John.11.49|49]] And one of them, \[named\] Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,

49: 

[[John.11.50|50]] Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.

50: 

[[John.11.51|51]] And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;

51: 

[[John.11.52|52]] And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.

52: 

[[John.11.53|53]] Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.

53: 

[[John.11.54|54]] Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.

54: 

[[John.11.55|55]] And the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.

55: 

[[John.11.56|56]] Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?

56: 

[[John.11.57|57]] Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew \[it\], that they might take him.
