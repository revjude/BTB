[[John.5|John 5:31 - John 5:38]]
*Testimonies about Jesus*

[[John.5.31|31]] If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.

31: 

[[John.5.32|32]] There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.

32: 

[[John.5.33|33]] Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.

33: 

[[John.5.34|34]] But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.

34: 

[[John.5.35|35]] He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.

35: 

[[John.5.36|36]] But I have greater witness than \[that\] of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.

36: 

[[John.5.37|37]] And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.

37: 

[[John.5.38|38]] And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.

38:
