[[John.19|John 19:16 - John 19:27]]
*The Crucifixion*

[[John.19.16|16]] Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led \[him\] away.

16: 

[[John.19.17|17]] And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called \[the place\] of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:

17: 

[[John.19.18|18]] Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.

18: 

[[John.19.19|19]] And Pilate wrote a title, and put \[it\] on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.

19: 

[[John.19.20|20]] This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, \[and\] Greek, \[and\] Latin.

20: 

[[John.19.21|21]] Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.

21: 

[[John.19.22|22]] Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.

22: 

[[John.19.23|23]] Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also \[his\] coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.

23: 

[[John.19.24|24]] They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.

24: 

[[John.19.25|25]] Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the \[wife\] of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

25: 

[[John.19.26|26]] When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!

26: 

[[John.19.27|27]] Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own \[home\].
