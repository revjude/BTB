[[John.16|John 16:5 - John 16:16]]
*The Promise of the Holy Spirit*

[[John.16.5|5]] But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?

5: 

[[John.16.6|6]] But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.

6: 

[[John.16.7|7]] Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.

7: 

[[John.16.8|8]] And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:

8: 

[[John.16.9|9]] Of sin, because they believe not on me;

9: 

[[John.16.10|10]] Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;

10: 

[[John.16.11|11]] Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.

11: 

[[John.16.12|12]] I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.

12: 

[[John.16.13|13]] Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, \[that\] shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.

13: 

[[John.16.14|14]] He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew \[it\] unto you.

14: 

[[John.16.15|15]] All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew \[it\] unto you.

15: 

[[John.16.16|16]] A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.

16:
