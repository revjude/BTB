[[John.11|John 11:17 - John 11:37]]
*Jesus Comforts Martha and Mary*

[[John.11.17|17]] Then when Jesus came, he found that he had \[lain\] in the grave four days already.

17: 

[[John.11.18|18]] Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:

18: 

[[John.11.19|19]] And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.

19: 

[[John.11.20|20]] Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat \[still\] in the house.

20: 

[[John.11.21|21]] Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.

21: 

[[John.11.22|22]] But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give \[it\] thee.

22: 

[[John.11.23|23]] Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.

23: 

[[John.11.24|24]] Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.

24: 

[[John.11.25|25]] Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:

25: 

[[John.11.26|26]] And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?

26: 

[[John.11.27|27]] She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.

27: 

[[John.11.28|28]] And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.

28: 

[[John.11.29|29]] As soon as she heard \[that\], she arose quickly, and came unto him.

29: 

[[John.11.30|30]] Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.

30: 

[[John.11.31|31]] The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.

31: 

[[John.11.32|32]] Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.

32: 

[[John.11.33|33]] When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,

33: 

[[John.11.34|34]] And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.

34: 

[[John.11.35|35]] Jesus wept.

35: 

[[John.11.36|36]] Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!

36: 

[[John.11.37|37]] And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?
