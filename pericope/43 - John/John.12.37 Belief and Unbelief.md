[[John.12|John 12:37 - John 12:50]]
*Belief and Unbelief*

[[John.12.37|37]] But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:

37: 

[[John.12.38|38]] That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?

38: 

[[John.12.39|39]] Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,

39: 

[[John.12.40|40]] He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with \[their\] eyes, nor understand with \[their\] heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.

40: 

[[John.12.41|41]] These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.

41: 

[[John.12.42|42]] Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess \[him\], lest they should be put out of the synagogue:

42: 

[[John.12.43|43]] For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.

43: 

[[John.12.44|44]] Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.

44: 

[[John.12.45|45]] And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.

45: 

[[John.12.46|46]] I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.

46: 

[[John.12.47|47]] And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.

47: 

[[John.12.48|48]] He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.

48: 

[[John.12.49|49]] For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.

49: 

[[John.12.50|50]] And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.

50:
