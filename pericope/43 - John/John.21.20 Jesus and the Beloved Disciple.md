[[John.21|John 21:20 - John 21:25]]
*Jesus and the Beloved Disciple*

[[John.21.20|20]] Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?

20: 

[[John.21.21|21]] Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what \[shall\] this man \[do\]?

21: 

[[John.21.22|22]] Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what \[is that\] to thee? follow thou me.

22: 

[[John.21.23|23]] Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what \[is that\] to thee?

23: 

[[John.21.24|24]] This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.

24: 

[[John.21.25|25]] And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.

25:
