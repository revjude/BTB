[[John.17|John 17:20 - John 17:26]]
*Prayer for All Believers*

[[John.17.20|20]] Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;

20: 

[[John.17.21|21]] That they all may be one; as thou, Father, \[art\] in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.

21: 

[[John.17.22|22]] And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:

22: 

[[John.17.23|23]] I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.

23: 

[[John.17.24|24]] Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.

24: 

[[John.17.25|25]] O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.

25: 

[[John.17.26|26]] And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare \[it\]: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.

26:
