[[John.20|John 20:24 - John 20:29]]
*Jesus Appears to Thomas*

[[John.20.24|24]] But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.

24: 

[[John.20.25|25]] The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.

25: 

[[John.20.26|26]] And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: \[then\] came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace \[be\] unto you.

26: 

[[John.20.27|27]] Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust \[it\] into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.

27: 

[[John.20.28|28]] And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.

28: 

[[John.20.29|29]] Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed \[are\] they that have not seen, and \[yet\] have believed.

29:
