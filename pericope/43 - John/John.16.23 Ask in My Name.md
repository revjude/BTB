[[John.16|John 16:23 - John 16:33]]
*Ask in My Name*

[[John.16.23|23]] And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give \[it\] you.

23: 

[[John.16.24|24]] Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.

24: 

[[John.16.25|25]] These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.

25: 

[[John.16.26|26]] At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:

26: 

[[John.16.27|27]] For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.

27: 

[[John.16.28|28]] I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.

28: 

[[John.16.29|29]] His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.

29: 

[[John.16.30|30]] Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.

30: 

[[John.16.31|31]] Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?

31: 

[[John.16.32|32]] Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.

32: 

[[John.16.33|33]] These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.

33:
