[[John.11|John 11:1 - John 11:16]]
*The Death of Lazarus*

[[John.11.1|1]] Now a certain \[man\] was sick, \[named\] Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.

1: 

[[John.11.2|2]] (It was \[that\] Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)

2: 

[[John.11.3|3]] Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.

3: 

[[John.11.4|4]] When Jesus heard \[that\], he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.

4: 

[[John.11.5|5]] Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.

5: 

[[John.11.6|6]] When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.

6: 

[[John.11.7|7]] Then after that saith he to \[his\] disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.

7: 

[[John.11.8|8]] \[His\] disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?

8: 

[[John.11.9|9]] Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.

9: 

[[John.11.10|10]] But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.

10: 

[[John.11.11|11]] These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.

11: 

[[John.11.12|12]] Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.

12: 

[[John.11.13|13]] Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.

13: 

[[John.11.14|14]] Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.

14: 

[[John.11.15|15]] And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.

15: 

[[John.11.16|16]] Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.

16:
