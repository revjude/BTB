[[John.10|John 10:1 - John 10:21]]
*Jesus the Good Shepherd*

[[John.10.1|1]] Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.

1: 

[[John.10.2|2]] But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

2: 

[[John.10.3|3]] To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.

3: 

[[John.10.4|4]] And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.

4: 

[[John.10.5|5]] And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.

5: 

[[John.10.6|6]] This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.

6: 

[[John.10.7|7]] Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.

7: 

[[John.10.8|8]] All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.

8: 

[[John.10.9|9]] I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.

9: 

[[John.10.10|10]] The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have \[it\] more abundantly.

10: 

[[John.10.11|11]] I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.

11: 

[[John.10.12|12]] But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.

12: 

[[John.10.13|13]] The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.

13: 

[[John.10.14|14]] I am the good shepherd, and know my \[sheep\], and am known of mine.

14: 

[[John.10.15|15]] As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.

15: 

[[John.10.16|16]] And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, \[and\] one shepherd.

16: 

[[John.10.17|17]] Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.

17: 

[[John.10.18|18]] No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.

18: 

[[John.10.19|19]] There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.

19: 

[[John.10.20|20]] And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?

20: 

[[John.10.21|21]] Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?

21:
