[[John.4|John 4:39 - John 4:42]]
*Many Samaritans Believe*

[[John.4.39|39]] And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.

39: 

[[John.4.40|40]] So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.

40: 

[[John.4.41|41]] And many more believed because of his own word;

41: 

[[John.4.42|42]] And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard \[him\] ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.

42:
