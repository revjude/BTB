[[John.14|John 14:15 - John 14:26]]
*Jesus Promises the Holy Spirit*

[[John.14.15|15]] If ye love me, keep my commandments.

15: 

[[John.14.16|16]] And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;

16: 

[[John.14.17|17]] \[Even\] the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.

17: 

[[John.14.18|18]] I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.

18: 

[[John.14.19|19]] Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.

19: 

[[John.14.20|20]] At that day ye shall know that I \[am\] in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.

20: 

[[John.14.21|21]] He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.

21: 

[[John.14.22|22]] Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?

22: 

[[John.14.23|23]] Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.

23: 

[[John.14.24|24]] He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s which sent me.

24: 

[[John.14.25|25]] These things have I spoken unto you, being \[yet\] present with you.

25: 

[[John.14.26|26]] But the Comforter, \[which is\] the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.

26:
