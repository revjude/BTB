*Peter’s Second and Third Denials*

[[John.18.25|25]] And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also \[one\] of his disciples? He denied \[it\], and said, I am not.

25: 

[[John.18.26|26]] One of the servants of the high priest, being \[his\] kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?

26: 

[[John.18.27|27]] Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.

27:
