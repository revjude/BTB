[[John.12|John 12:20 - John 12:36]]
*Jesus Predicts His Death*

[[John.12.20|20]] And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:

20: 

[[John.12.21|21]] The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.

21: 

[[John.12.22|22]] Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.

22: 

[[John.12.23|23]] And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.

23: 

[[John.12.24|24]] Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.

24: 

[[John.12.25|25]] He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.

25: 

[[John.12.26|26]] If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will \[my\] Father honour.

26: 

[[John.12.27|27]] Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.

27: 

[[John.12.28|28]] Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, \[saying\], I have both glorified \[it\], and will glorify \[it\] again.

28: 

[[John.12.29|29]] The people therefore, that stood by, and heard \[it\], said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.

29: 

[[John.12.30|30]] Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.

30: 

[[John.12.31|31]] Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.

31: 

[[John.12.32|32]] And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all \[men\] unto me.

32: 

[[John.12.33|33]] This he said, signifying what death he should die.

33: 

[[John.12.34|34]] The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?

34: 

[[John.12.35|35]] Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.

35: 

[[John.12.36|36]] While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.
