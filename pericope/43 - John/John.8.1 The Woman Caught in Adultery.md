[[John.8|John 8:1 - John 8:11]]
*The Woman Caught in Adultery*

[[John.8.1|1]] Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.

1: 

[[John.8.2|2]] And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.

2: 

[[John.8.3|3]] And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,

3: 

[[John.8.4|4]] They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.

4: 

[[John.8.5|5]] Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?

5: 

[[John.8.6|6]] This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with \[his\] finger wrote on the ground, \[as though he heard them not\].

6: 

[[John.8.7|7]] So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.

7: 

[[John.8.8|8]] And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.

8: 

[[John.8.9|9]] And they which heard \[it\], being convicted by \[their own\] conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, \[even\] unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.

9: 

[[John.8.10|10]] When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?

10: 

[[John.8.11|11]] She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.

11:
