[[John.18|John 18:1 - John 18:14]]
*The Betrayal of Jesus*

[[John.18.1|1]] When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.

1: 

[[John.18.2|2]] And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.

2: 

[[John.18.3|3]] Judas then, having received a band \[of men\] and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.

3: 

[[John.18.4|4]] Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?

4: 

[[John.18.5|5]] They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am \[he\]. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.

5: 

[[John.18.6|6]] As soon then as he had said unto them, I am \[he\], they went backward, and fell to the ground.

6: 

[[John.18.7|7]] Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.

7: 

[[John.18.8|8]] Jesus answered, I have told you that I am \[he\]: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:

8: 

[[John.18.9|9]] That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.

9: 

[[John.18.10|10]] Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.

10: 

[[John.18.11|11]] Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?

11: 

[[John.18.12|12]] Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,

12: 

[[John.18.13|13]] And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.

13: 

[[John.18.14|14]] Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
