[[John.17|John 17:1 - John 17:5]]
*Prayer for the Son*

[[John.17.1|1]] These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:

1: 

[[John.17.2|2]] As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.

2: 

[[John.17.3|3]] And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.

3: 

[[John.17.4|4]] I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.

4: 

[[John.17.5|5]] And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.

5:
