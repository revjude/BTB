[[John.3|John 3:1 - John 3:21]]
*Jesus and Nicodemus*

[[John.3.1|1]] There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:

1: 

[[John.3.2|2]] The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.

2: 

[[John.3.3|3]] Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

3: 

[[John.3.4|4]] Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?

4: 

[[John.3.5|5]] Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and \[of\] the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

5: 

[[John.3.6|6]] That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

6: 

[[John.3.7|7]] Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.

7: 

[[John.3.8|8]] The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.

8: 

[[John.3.9|9]] Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?

9: 

[[John.3.10|10]] Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?

10: 

[[John.3.11|11]] Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.

11: 

[[John.3.12|12]] If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you \[of\] heavenly things?

12: 

[[John.3.13|13]] And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, \[even\] the Son of man which is in heaven.

13: 

[[John.3.14|14]] And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:

14: 

[[John.3.15|15]] That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.

15: 

[[John.3.16|16]] For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

16: 

[[John.3.17|17]] For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.

17: 

[[John.3.18|18]] He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

18: 

[[John.3.19|19]] And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.

19: 

[[John.3.20|20]] For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.

20: 

[[John.3.21|21]] But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

21:
