[[John.7|John 7:1 - John 7:24]]
*Jesus Teaches at the Feast*

[[John.7.1|1]] After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.

1: 

[[John.7.2|2]] Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand.

2: 

[[John.7.3|3]] His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.

3: 

[[John.7.4|4]] For \[there is\] no man \[that\] doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.

4: 

[[John.7.5|5]] For neither did his brethren believe in him.

5: 

[[John.7.6|6]] Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.

6: 

[[John.7.7|7]] The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.

7: 

[[John.7.8|8]] Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.

8: 

[[John.7.9|9]] When he had said these words unto them, he abode \[still\] in Galilee.

9: 

[[John.7.10|10]] But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.

10: 

[[John.7.11|11]] Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?

11: 

[[John.7.12|12]] And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.

12: 

[[John.7.13|13]] Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.

13: 

[[John.7.14|14]] Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.

14: 

[[John.7.15|15]] And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?

15: 

[[John.7.16|16]] Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.

16: 

[[John.7.17|17]] If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or \[whether\] I speak of myself.

17: 

[[John.7.18|18]] He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.

18: 

[[John.7.19|19]] Did not Moses give you the law, and \[yet\] none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?

19: 

[[John.7.20|20]] The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?

20: 

[[John.7.21|21]] Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.

21: 

[[John.7.22|22]] Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.

22: 

[[John.7.23|23]] If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?

23: 

[[John.7.24|24]] Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.

24:
