[[John.20|John 20:1 - John 20:9]]
*The Resurrection*

[[John.20.1|1]] The first \[day\] of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.

1: 

[[John.20.2|2]] Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.

2: 

[[John.20.3|3]] Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.

3: 

[[John.20.4|4]] So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.

4: 

[[John.20.5|5]] And he stooping down, \[and looking in\], saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.

5: 

[[John.20.6|6]] Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,

6: 

[[John.20.7|7]] And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.

7: 

[[John.20.8|8]] Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.

8: 

[[John.20.9|9]] For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.

9:
