[[John.1|John 1:19 - John 1:28]]
*The Mission of John the Baptist*

[[John.1.19|19]] And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?

19: 

[[John.1.20|20]] And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.

20: 

[[John.1.21|21]] And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.

21: 

[[John.1.22|22]] Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?

22: 

[[John.1.23|23]] He said, I \[am\] the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.

23: 

[[John.1.24|24]] And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.

24: 

[[John.1.25|25]] And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?

25: 

[[John.1.26|26]] John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;

26: 

[[John.1.27|27]] He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.

27: 

[[John.1.28|28]] These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.

28:
