[[John.18|John 18:19 - John 18:24]]
*Jesus before the High Priest*

[[John.18.19|19]] The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.

19: 

[[John.18.20|20]] Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.

20: 

[[John.18.21|21]] Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.

21: 

[[John.18.22|22]] And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?

22: 

[[John.18.23|23]] Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?

23: 

[[John.18.24|24]] Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.

24:
