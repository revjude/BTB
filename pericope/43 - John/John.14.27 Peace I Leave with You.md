[[John.14|John 14:27 - John 14:31]]
*Peace I Leave with You*

[[John.14.27|27]] Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

27: 

[[John.14.28|28]] Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come \[again\] unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.

28: 

[[John.14.29|29]] And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.

29: 

[[John.14.30|30]] Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.

30: 

[[John.14.31|31]] But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.

31:
