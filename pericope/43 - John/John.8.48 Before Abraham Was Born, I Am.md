[[John.8|John 8:48 - John 8:59]]
*Before Abraham Was Born, I Am*

[[John.8.48|48]] Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?

48: 

[[John.8.49|49]] Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.

49: 

[[John.8.50|50]] And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.

50: 

[[John.8.51|51]] Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.

51: 

[[John.8.52|52]] Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.

52: 

[[John.8.53|53]] Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?

53: 

[[John.8.54|54]] Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:

54: 

[[John.8.55|55]] Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.

55: 

[[John.8.56|56]] Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw \[it\], and was glad.

56: 

[[John.8.57|57]] Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?

57: 

[[John.8.58|58]] Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.

58: 

[[John.8.59|59]] Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.

59:
