[[John.14|John 14:5 - John 14:14]]
*The Way, the Truth, and the Life*

[[John.14.5|5]] Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?

5: 

[[John.14.6|6]] Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

6: 

[[John.14.7|7]] If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.

7: 

[[John.14.8|8]] Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.

8: 

[[John.14.9|9]] Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou \[then\], Shew us the Father?

9: 

[[John.14.10|10]] Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.

10: 

[[John.14.11|11]] Believe me that I \[am\] in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake.

11: 

[[John.14.12|12]] Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater \[works\] than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.

12: 

[[John.14.13|13]] And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

13: 

[[John.14.14|14]] If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do \[it\].

14:
