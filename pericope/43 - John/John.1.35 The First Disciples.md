[[John.1|John 1:35 - John 1:42]]
*The First Disciples*

[[John.1.35|35]] Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;

35: 

[[John.1.36|36]] And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!

36: 

[[John.1.37|37]] And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.

37: 

[[John.1.38|38]] Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?

38: 

[[John.1.39|39]] He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.

39: 

[[John.1.40|40]] One of the two which heard John \[speak\], and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.

40: 

[[John.1.41|41]] He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.

41: 

[[John.1.42|42]] And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.

42:
