[[John.10|John 10:22 - John 10:39]]
*Jesus at the Feast of Dedication*

[[John.10.22|22]] And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.

22: 

[[John.10.23|23]] And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.

23: 

[[John.10.24|24]] Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.

24: 

[[John.10.25|25]] Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me.

25: 

[[John.10.26|26]] But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.

26: 

[[John.10.27|27]] My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:

27: 

[[John.10.28|28]] And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any \[man\] pluck them out of my hand.

28: 

[[John.10.29|29]] My Father, which gave \[them\] me, is greater than all; and no \[man\] is able to pluck \[them\] out of my Father’s hand.

29: 

[[John.10.30|30]] I and \[my\] Father are one.

30: 

[[John.10.31|31]] Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.

31: 

[[John.10.32|32]] Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?

32: 

[[John.10.33|33]] The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.

33: 

[[John.10.34|34]] Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?

34: 

[[John.10.35|35]] If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;

35: 

[[John.10.36|36]] Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?

36: 

[[John.10.37|37]] If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.

37: 

[[John.10.38|38]] But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father \[is\] in me, and I in him.

38: 

[[John.10.39|39]] Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,
