[[John.16|John 16:17 - John 16:22]]
*Grief Will Turn to Joy*

[[John.16.17|17]] Then said \[some\] of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?

17: 

[[John.16.18|18]] They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.

18: 

[[John.16.19|19]] Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?

19: 

[[John.16.20|20]] Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.

20: 

[[John.16.21|21]] A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.

21: 

[[John.16.22|22]] And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.

22:
