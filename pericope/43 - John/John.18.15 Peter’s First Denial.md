[[John.18|John 18:15 - John 18:18]]
*Peter’s First Denial*

[[John.18.15|15]] And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and \[so did\] another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.

15: 

[[John.18.16|16]] But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.

16: 

[[John.18.17|17]] Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also \[one\] of this man’s disciples? He saith, I am not.

17: 

[[John.18.18|18]] And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.

18:
