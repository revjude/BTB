[[John.19|John 19:1 - John 19:15]]
*The Soldiers Mock Jesus*

[[John.19.1|1]] Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged \[him\].

1: 

[[John.19.2|2]] And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put \[it\] on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,

2: 

[[John.19.3|3]] And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.

3: 

[[John.19.4|4]] Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.

4: 

[[John.19.5|5]] Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And \[Pilate\] saith unto them, Behold the man!

5: 

[[John.19.6|6]] When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify \[him\], crucify \[him\]. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify \[him\]: for I find no fault in him.

6: 

[[John.19.7|7]] The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.

7: 

[[John.19.8|8]] When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;

8: 

[[John.19.9|9]] And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.

9: 

[[John.19.10|10]] Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?

10: 

[[John.19.11|11]] Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power \[at all\] against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.

11: 

[[John.19.12|12]] And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar’s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.

12: 

[[John.19.13|13]] When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.

13: 

[[John.19.14|14]] And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!

14: 

[[John.19.15|15]] But they cried out, Away with \[him\], away with \[him\], crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.

15:
