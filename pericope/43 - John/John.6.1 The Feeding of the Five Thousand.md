[[John.6|John 6:1 - John 6:15]]
*The Feeding of the Five Thousand*

[[John.6.1|1]] After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is \[the sea\] of Tiberias.

1: 

[[John.6.2|2]] And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.

2: 

[[John.6.3|3]] And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.

3: 

[[John.6.4|4]] And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.

4: 

[[John.6.5|5]] When Jesus then lifted up \[his\] eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?

5: 

[[John.6.6|6]] And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.

6: 

[[John.6.7|7]] Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.

7: 

[[John.6.8|8]] One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto him,

8: 

[[John.6.9|9]] There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?

9: 

[[John.6.10|10]] And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.

10: 

[[John.6.11|11]] And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.

11: 

[[John.6.12|12]] When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.

12: 

[[John.6.13|13]] Therefore they gathered \[them\] together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.

13: 

[[John.6.14|14]] Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.

14: 

[[John.6.15|15]] When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.

15:
