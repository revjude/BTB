[[John.19|John 19:31 - John 19:37]]
*Jesus’ Side Is Pierced*

[[John.19.31|31]] The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and \[that\] they might be taken away.

31: 

[[John.19.32|32]] Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.

32: 

[[John.19.33|33]] But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:

33: 

[[John.19.34|34]] But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.

34: 

[[John.19.35|35]] And he that saw \[it\] bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.

35: 

[[John.19.36|36]] For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.

36: 

[[John.19.37|37]] And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.

37:
