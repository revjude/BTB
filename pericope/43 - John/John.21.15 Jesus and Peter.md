[[John.21|John 21:15 - John 21:19]]
*Jesus and Peter*

[[John.21.15|15]] So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, \[son\] of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.

15: 

[[John.21.16|16]] He saith to him again the second time, Simon, \[son\] of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.

16: 

[[John.21.17|17]] He saith unto him the third time, Simon, \[son\] of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.

17: 

[[John.21.18|18]] Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry \[thee\] whither thou wouldest not.

18: 

[[John.21.19|19]] This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.
