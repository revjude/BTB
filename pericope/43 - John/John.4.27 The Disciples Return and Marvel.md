[[John.4|John 4:27 - John 4:38]]
*The Disciples Return and Marvel*

[[John.4.27|27]] And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?

27: 

[[John.4.28|28]] The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,

28: 

[[John.4.29|29]] Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?

29: 

[[John.4.30|30]] Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.

30: 

[[John.4.31|31]] In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.

31: 

[[John.4.32|32]] But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.

32: 

[[John.4.33|33]] Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him \[ought\] to eat?

33: 

[[John.4.34|34]] Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.

34: 

[[John.4.35|35]] Say not ye, There are yet four months, and \[then\] cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.

35: 

[[John.4.36|36]] And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.

36: 

[[John.4.37|37]] And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.

37: 

[[John.4.38|38]] I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.

38:
