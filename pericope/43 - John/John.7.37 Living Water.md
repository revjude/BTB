[[John.7|John 7:37 - John 7:39]]
*Living Water*

[[John.7.37|37]] In the last day, that great \[day\] of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.

37: 

[[John.7.38|38]] He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.

38: 

[[John.7.39|39]] (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet \[given\]; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)

39:
