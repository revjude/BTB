[[John.5|John 5:39 - John 5:47]]
*The Witness of Scripture*

[[John.5.39|39]] Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.

39: 

[[John.5.40|40]] And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.

40: 

[[John.5.41|41]] I receive not honour from men.

41: 

[[John.5.42|42]] But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.

42: 

[[John.5.43|43]] I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.

43: 

[[John.5.44|44]] How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that \[cometh\] from God only?

44: 

[[John.5.45|45]] Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is \[one\] that accuseth you, \[even\] Moses, in whom ye trust.

45: 

[[John.5.46|46]] For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.

46: 

[[John.5.47|47]] But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?

47:
