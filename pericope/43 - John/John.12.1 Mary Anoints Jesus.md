[[John.12|John 12:1 - John 12:8]]
*Mary Anoints Jesus*

[[John.12.1|1]] Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.

1: 

[[John.12.2|2]] There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.

2: 

[[John.12.3|3]] Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.

3: 

[[John.12.4|4]] Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s \[son\], which should betray him,

4: 

[[John.12.5|5]] Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?

5: 

[[John.12.6|6]] This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.

6: 

[[John.12.7|7]] Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.

7: 

[[John.12.8|8]] For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.

8:
