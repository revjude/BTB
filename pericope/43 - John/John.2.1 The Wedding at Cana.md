[[John.2|John 2:1 - John 2:11]]
*The Wedding at Cana*

[[John.2.1|1]] And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:

1: 

[[John.2.2|2]] And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.

2: 

[[John.2.3|3]] And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.

3: 

[[John.2.4|4]] Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.

4: 

[[John.2.5|5]] His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do \[it\].

5: 

[[John.2.6|6]] And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.

6: 

[[John.2.7|7]] Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.

7: 

[[John.2.8|8]] And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare \[it\].

8: 

[[John.2.9|9]] When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,

9: 

[[John.2.10|10]] And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: \[but\] thou hast kept the good wine until now.

10: 

[[John.2.11|11]] This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
