[[John.20|John 20:19 - John 20:23]]
*Jesus Appears to the Disciples*

[[John.20.19|19]] Then the same day at evening, being the first \[day\] of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace \[be\] unto you.

19: 

[[John.20.20|20]] And when he had so said, he shewed unto them \[his\] hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.

20: 

[[John.20.21|21]] Then said Jesus to them again, Peace \[be\] unto you: as \[my\] Father hath sent me, even so send I you.

21: 

[[John.20.22|22]] And when he had said this, he breathed on \[them\], and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:

22: 

[[John.20.23|23]] Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; \[and\] whose soever \[sins\] ye retain, they are retained.

23:
