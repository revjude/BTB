[[John.5|John 5:1 - John 5:15]]
*The Pool of Bethesda*

[[John.5.1|1]] After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

1: 

[[John.5.2|2]] Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep \[market\] a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.

2: 

[[John.5.3|3]] In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.

3: 

[[John.5.5|5]] And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.

5: 

[[John.5.6|6]] When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time \[in that case\], he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?

6: 

[[John.5.7|7]] The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.

7: 

[[John.5.8|8]] Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.

8: 

[[John.5.9|9]] And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.

9: 

[[John.5.10|10]] The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry \[thy\] bed.

10: 

[[John.5.11|11]] He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.

11: 

[[John.5.12|12]] Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?

12: 

[[John.5.13|13]] And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in \[that\] place.

13: 

[[John.5.14|14]] Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.

14: 

[[John.5.15|15]] The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.

15:
