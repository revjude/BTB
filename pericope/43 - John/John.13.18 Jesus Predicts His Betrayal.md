[[John.13|John 13:18 - John 13:30]]
*Jesus Predicts His Betrayal*

[[John.13.18|18]] I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.

18: 

[[John.13.19|19]] Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am \[he\].

19: 

[[John.13.20|20]] Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.

20: 

[[John.13.21|21]] When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.

21: 

[[John.13.22|22]] Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.

22: 

[[John.13.23|23]] Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.

23: 

[[John.13.24|24]] Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.

24: 

[[John.13.25|25]] He then lying on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?

25: 

[[John.13.26|26]] Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped \[it\]. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave \[it\] to Judas Iscariot, \[the son\] of Simon.

26: 

[[John.13.27|27]] And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.

27: 

[[John.13.28|28]] Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.

28: 

[[John.13.29|29]] For some \[of them\] thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy \[those things\] that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.

29: 

[[John.13.30|30]] He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.

30:
