[[John.1|John 1:43 - John 1:51]]
*Jesus Calls Philip and Nathanael*

[[John.1.43|43]] The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.

43: 

[[John.1.44|44]] Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.

44: 

[[John.1.45|45]] Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.

45: 

[[John.1.46|46]] And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.

46: 

[[John.1.47|47]] Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!

47: 

[[John.1.48|48]] Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.

48: 

[[John.1.49|49]] Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.

49: 

[[John.1.50|50]] Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.

50: 

[[John.1.51|51]] And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

51:
