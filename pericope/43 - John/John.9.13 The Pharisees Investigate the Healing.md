[[John.9|John 9:13 - John 9:34]]
*The Pharisees Investigate the Healing*

[[John.9.13|13]] They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.

13: 

[[John.9.14|14]] And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.

14: 

[[John.9.15|15]] Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.

15: 

[[John.9.16|16]] Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.

16: 

[[John.9.17|17]] They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.

17: 

[[John.9.18|18]] But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.

18: 

[[John.9.19|19]] And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?

19: 

[[John.9.20|20]] His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:

20: 

[[John.9.21|21]] But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.

21: 

[[John.9.22|22]] These \[words\] spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.

22: 

[[John.9.23|23]] Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.

23: 

[[John.9.24|24]] Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.

24: 

[[John.9.25|25]] He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner \[or no\], I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.

25: 

[[John.9.26|26]] Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?

26: 

[[John.9.27|27]] He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear \[it\] again? will ye also be his disciples?

27: 

[[John.9.28|28]] Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples.

28: 

[[John.9.29|29]] We know that God spake unto Moses: \[as for\] this \[fellow\], we know not from whence he is.

29: 

[[John.9.30|30]] The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and \[yet\] he hath opened mine eyes.

30: 

[[John.9.31|31]] Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.

31: 

[[John.9.32|32]] Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.

32: 

[[John.9.33|33]] If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.

33: 

[[John.9.34|34]] They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.

34:
