[[John.19|John 19:38 - John 19:42]]
*The Burial of Jesus*

[[John.19.38|38]] And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave \[him\] leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.

38: 

[[John.19.39|39]] And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound \[weight\].

39: 

[[John.19.40|40]] Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.

40: 

[[John.19.41|41]] Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.

41: 

[[John.19.42|42]] There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews’ preparation \[day\]; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.
