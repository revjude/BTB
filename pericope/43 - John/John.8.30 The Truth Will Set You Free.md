[[John.8|John 8:30 - John 8:47]]
*The Truth Will Set You Free*

[[John.8.30|30]] As he spake these words, many believed on him.

30: 

[[John.8.31|31]] Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, \[then\] are ye my disciples indeed;

31: 

[[John.8.32|32]] And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.

32: 

[[John.8.33|33]] They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?

33: 

[[John.8.34|34]] Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.

34: 

[[John.8.35|35]] And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: \[but\] the Son abideth ever.

35: 

[[John.8.36|36]] If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.

36: 

[[John.8.37|37]] I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.

37: 

[[John.8.38|38]] I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.

38: 

[[John.8.39|39]] They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.

39: 

[[John.8.40|40]] But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.

40: 

[[John.8.41|41]] Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, \[even\] God.

41: 

[[John.8.42|42]] Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.

42: 

[[John.8.43|43]] Why do ye not understand my speech? \[even\] because ye cannot hear my word.

43: 

[[John.8.44|44]] Ye are of \[your\] father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.

44: 

[[John.8.45|45]] And because I tell \[you\] the truth, ye believe me not.

45: 

[[John.8.46|46]] Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?

46: 

[[John.8.47|47]] He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear \[them\] not, because ye are not of God.
