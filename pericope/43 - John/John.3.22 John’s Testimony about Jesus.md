[[John.3|John 3:22 - John 3:36]]
*John’s Testimony about Jesus*

[[John.3.22|22]] After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.

22: 

[[John.3.23|23]] And John also was baptizing in AEnon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.

23: 

[[John.3.24|24]] For John was not yet cast into prison.

24: 

[[John.3.25|25]] Then there arose a question between \[some\] of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.

25: 

[[John.3.26|26]] And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all \[men\] come to him.

26: 

[[John.3.27|27]] John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.

27: 

[[John.3.28|28]] Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.

28: 

[[John.3.29|29]] He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.

29: 

[[John.3.30|30]] He must increase, but I \[must\] decrease.

30: 

[[John.3.31|31]] He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.

31: 

[[John.3.32|32]] And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.

32: 

[[John.3.33|33]] He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.

33: 

[[John.3.34|34]] For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure \[unto him\].

34: 

[[John.3.35|35]] The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.

35: 

[[John.3.36|36]] He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.

36:
