[[Titus.1|Titus 1:10 - Titus 1:16]]
*Correcting False Teachers*

[[Titus.1.10|10]] For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:

10: 

[[Titus.1.11|11]] Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.

11: 

[[Titus.1.12|12]] One of themselves, \[even\] a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians \[are\] alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.

12: 

[[Titus.1.13|13]] This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;

13: 

[[Titus.1.14|14]] Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.

14: 

[[Titus.1.15|15]] Unto the pure all things \[are\] pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving \[is\] nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.

15: 

[[Titus.1.16|16]] They profess that they know God; but in works they deny \[him\], being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.

16:
