[[Titus.2|Titus 2:1 - Titus 2:10]]
*Teaching Sound Doctrine*

[[Titus.2.1|1]] But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:

1: 

[[Titus.2.2|2]] That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.

2: 

[[Titus.2.3|3]] The aged women likewise, that \[they be\] in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;

3: 

[[Titus.2.4|4]] That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,

4: 

[[Titus.2.5|5]] \[To be\] discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.

5: 

[[Titus.2.6|6]] Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.

6: 

[[Titus.2.7|7]] In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine \[shewing\] uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,

7: 

[[Titus.2.8|8]] Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.

8: 

[[Titus.2.9|9]] \[Exhort\] servants to be obedient unto their own masters, \[and\] to please \[them\] well in all \[things\]; not answering again;

9: 

[[Titus.2.10|10]] Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
