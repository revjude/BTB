[[Titus.3|Titus 3:1 - Titus 3:8]]
*Heirs of Grace*

[[Titus.3.1|1]] Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,

1: 

[[Titus.3.2|2]] To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, \[but\] gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.

2: 

[[Titus.3.3|3]] For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, \[and\] hating one another.

3: 

[[Titus.3.4|4]] But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,

4: 

[[Titus.3.5|5]] Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;

5: 

[[Titus.3.6|6]] Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;

6: 

[[Titus.3.7|7]] That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

7: 

[[Titus.3.8|8]] \[This is\] a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.

8:
