[[Titus.3|Titus 3:9 - Titus 3:11]]
*Avoid Divisions*

[[Titus.3.9|9]] But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.

9: 

[[Titus.3.10|10]] A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;

10: 

[[Titus.3.11|11]] Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.

11:
