[[Titus.1|Titus 1:5 - Titus 1:9]]
*Appointing Elders on Crete*

[[Titus.1.5|5]] For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:

5: 

[[Titus.1.6|6]] If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.

6: 

[[Titus.1.7|7]] For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;

7: 

[[Titus.1.8|8]] But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;

8: 

[[Titus.1.9|9]] Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.

9:
