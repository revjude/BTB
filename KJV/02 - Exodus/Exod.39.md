[^10]: The meaning of the word ***shoham*** is not easily determined. It has been variously rendered a beryl, emerald, prasius, sapphire, sardius, ruby, carnelian, onyx, and sardonyx. It may signify both the onyx and sardonyx. The latter stone is a mixture of the chalcedony and carnelian, sometimes in strata, and at other times blended together, and is found striped with white and red strata, or layers. It is generally allowed that there is no real difference, except in hardness, between the carnelian, chalcedony, agate, sardonyx, and onyx. The onyx is of a darkish horny colour, resembling the nail or hoof, from which circumstance it has its name (<span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>ονυξ</span></span>). It has often a plate of a blueish white or red in it, and when on one or both sides of this white there appears a plate of a reddish colour, the jewellers call the stone a sardonyx.

It is a fine pellucid substance never debased with any admixture of other matter; susceptible of elegant tinges from metal-line particles; giving fire with steel; not fermenting with acid menstrua; scarcely calcinable by any degree of fire; and of one simple and permanent appearance in all lights. It is the hardest and most valuable of all gems; when pure, perfectly clear and pellucid as the clearest water, and eminently distinguished from all other substances by its vivid splendour, and the brightness of its reflections.

It is of a white, reddish, yellowish, or greenish ground; and so variously figured in its substance as to represent plants, trees, animals, and other objects.

[^19]: ***Achlamah***, an amethyst, a transparent gem, composed of a strong blue and deep red; and according as either prevails, affording different tinges of purple, sometimes approaching to violet, and sometimes even fading to a pale rose colour.

[^20]: ***Tarshish***, a pellucid gem, of a sea or blueish green colour.
