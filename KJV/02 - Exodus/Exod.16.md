[^44]: What the substance called manna was, is utterly unknown, but, from the circumstances in the text, it is evident that it was not a natural production, but was miraculously sent by Jehovah. These the learned Abarbinel, a most judicious Jewish interpreter, has thus enumerated:

[^45]: - The natural manna was never found in the desert where this fell where the common manna does fall;

[^46]:  - It is only in the spring time, in March and April, whereas this fell throughout all the months in the year;

[^47]:  - The ordinary manna does not melt in the sun, as this did ([[Exod.16|Exod 16:21]]);

[^48]:  - It does not stink and breed worms, as this did, when kept till the morning ([[Exod.16|Exod 16:20]]);

[^49]:  - It cannot be ground or beaten in a mortar, so as to make cakes, as this was;

[^50]:  - The common manna is medicinal and purgative, and cannot be used for food and nutriment, as this was;

[^51]:  - This fell in a double proportion on the sixth day, and not on the sabbath, as it certainly would have done had it fallen naturally;

[^52]:  - It followed them in all their journeys, where ever they pitched their tents; and

[^53]:  - It ceased at the very time of the year when the other falls, namely, in March, when the Israelites were come to Gilgal.

[^54]:  Whatever this substance was, it does not appear to have been common to the wilderness. From [[Deut.8|Deut 8:3]], [[Deut.8|Deut 8:16]], it is evident that the Israelites never saw it before; and from a pot of it being preserved, it is certain that nothing of the kind ever appeared again.

[^66]: [[Exod.16|Exod 16:15]] In consequence of the term manna having been given to a drug which is now much used in England, many persons have ignorantly supposed it to be the same sort of thing as that miraculously sent for the sustenance of the children of Israel in the wilderness. The manna of commerce comes from Calabria and Sicily, where it oozes out of a kind of ash tree, from the end of June to the end of July, and is a thick, clammy, sweet juice, partly drawn from the tree by the rays of the sun, partly by the puncture of insects, and partly by artificial means. The European manna is not so good as the Oriental, which is gathered in Syria, Arabia, and Persia, from the Oriental oak, and from a shrub which is called in Persia ***teranjabin***.
