[^49]: The word ***aizov***, which has been variously rendered, most probably denotes Hyssop; whence are derived the Chaldee ***aizova***, Syriac ***zupha***, Arabic ***zupha***, Ethiopic ***azab***, and ***hushopa***, Greek <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>υσσωπος</span></span>, ***hussopos*** <small><sup>[[G5301]]</sup></small>, Latin ***hyssopus***, German ***usop***, and our hyssop, a name retained, with little variation, in all the western languages. It is a plant of the ***gymnospermia*** (naked seeded) order, belonging to the ***didynamia*** class. It has bushy stalks, growing a foot and a half high; small spear-shaped, close-sitting, and opposite leaves, with several smaller ones rising from the same joint; and all the stalks and branches terminated by erect whorled spikes of flowers, of different colours in the varieties of the plant. The leaves have an aromatic smell, and a warm, pungent taste. Its detersive, cleansing, and medicinal qualities were probably the reason why it was so particularly recommended in Scripture.

[^64]: ***the Lord smote*** The infliction of this judgment on the Egyptians was most equitable; because, after their nation had been preserved by one of the Israelitish family, they had, contrary to all right, and in defiance of original stipulation, enslaved the people to whom they had been so much indebted, had murdered their offspring, and made their bondage intolerable.

[^65]: No people were more remarkable and frantic in their mournings than the Egyptians. When a relative died, every one left the house, and the women, with their hair loose, and their bosoms bare, ran wild about the street. The men also, with their apparel equally disordered, kept them company; all shrieking, howling, and beating themselves. What a scene of horror and distress must now have presented itself, when there was not a family in Egypt where there was not one dead!

[^84]: The Samaritan Pentateuch reads, "Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, and of their fathers in the land of Canaan and in the land of Egypt, was 430 years." The Alexandrine copy of the LXX has the same reading; and the same statement is made by the apostle Paul, in [[Gal.3|Gal 3:17]], who reckons from the promise made to Abraham to the giving of the law. That these three witnesses have the truth, the chronology itself proves; for it is evident that the descendants of Israel did not dwell 430 years in Egypt; while it is equally evident, that the period from Abraham's entry into Canaan to the Exodus, is exactly that number. Thus, from Abraham's entrance into the promised land to the birth of Isaac, was 25 years; Isaac was 60 at the birth of Jacob; Jacob was 130 at his going into Egypt; where he and his children continued 215 years more; making in the whole 430 years.
