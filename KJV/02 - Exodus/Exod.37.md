It was made of the same materials as the ark, and with a golden cornice; but it had also another cornice below the edge, and one at the bottom, with a border between the two of a hand breadth; though some think one border only was below the edge, and that this was towards the bottom, to keep the feet or legs more closely united. The table also had rings and staves for the convenience of removing it. To it were annexed several vessels; as dishes, in which some think the shewbread was placed; or, according to others, the flour of which it was made, or the oil used for various purposes; spoons, which were employed about the incense offered on the golden altar, or carried within the vail in a censer on the day of atonement. Some have supposed the word to denote vials, as we read of vials full of odours and incense ([[Rev.5|Rev 5:3]]): covers, which seem to have been put over both the loaves and the incense, yet some suppose they were vessels used in drink-offerings; but that is more reasonably considered as the use of the bowls.
