[^14]: ***Shoterim***, from the Arabic ***saytara***, to overlook, superintend, seems to denote, as ***musaytar*** in Arabic also does, overseers, superintendents. They may have been somewhat like the chiefs of trades, who are found in every city in the East; where every trade has a head, who is entrusted with authority over them, and is in some measure answerable for them to Government. Compare [[Exod.2|Exod 2:14]]. [[Num.11|Num 11:16]]; [[Deut.1|Deut 1:15]], [[Deut.16|Deut 16:18]]; [[Josh.8|Josh 8:33]], [[Josh.24|Josh 24:1]], [[Josh.24|Josh 24:4]]; [[2Chr.26|2Chr 26:11]]

[^15]: The straw was mixed with clay, in order to make the bricks. This is expressly affirmed by Philo (vit. Mos.) who was himself a native of Alexandria, in Egypt. He says, describing the oppression of the Israelites, that some were obliged to work in clay, and others to gather straw for the formation of bricks, <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>πλινθου</span> <span class='asgreek'>γαρ</span> <span class='asgreek'>αχυρα</span> <span class='asgreek'>δεσμος</span></span>, because straw is the binding of the brick. Philo's account is confirmed by Dr. Shaw, who says that "some of the Egyptian pyramids are made of brick, the composition whereof is only a mixture of clay, mud, and straw, slightly blended and kneaded together, and afterwards baked in the sun. The straw, which keeps the bricks together, and still preserves its original colour, seems to be a proof that these bricks were never burnt or made in kilns." The same materials are now used for building in Egypt. Mr. Baumgarten says, "The houses are for the most part of bricks that are only hardened by the heat of the sun, and mixed with straw to make them firm." [[Gen.24|Gen 24:25]]; [[Judg.19|Judg 19:19]]
