Bochart, however, seems to have proved that lice, and not gnats, are meant; because:

[^26]: 1. They sprang from the dust, and not from the waters;

[^27]:  2. They were on both man and beast, which cannot be said of gnats;

[^28]:  3. Their name is derived from ***koon***, to make firm, fix, establish, which cannot agree with gnats, flies, etc., which are ever changing place, and almost constantly on the wing;

[^29]:  4. The term ***kinnah*** is used by the Talmudists to express the louse.

[^30]: This insect must have been a very dreadful and afflicting plague to the Egyptians, and especially to the priests, who were obliged to shave all their hair off, and to wear a single linen tunic, to prevent vermin harbouring about them.

[^45]: How intolerable a plague of flies can prove, is evident from the fact that whole districts have been laid waste by them. The inhabitants have been forced to quit their cities, not being able to stand against the flies and gnats with which they were pestered. Hence different people had deities whose office it was to defend them against flies. Among these may be reckoned Baalzebub, the fly-god of Ekron; Hercules, ***muscarum abactor***, Hercules the expeller of flies; and hence Jupiter had the titles of <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>απομυιος</span></span>, <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>μυιαγρος</span></span>, <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>μυιοχορος</span></span>, because he was supposed to expel flies, and especially clear his temples of these insects.
