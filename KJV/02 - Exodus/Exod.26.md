[^2]: The word ***mishcan***, from ***shachan***, to dwell, means simply a dwelling-place, or habitation. "When God had brought the children of Israel out of Egypt," says the very learned Dr. Cudworth, "resolving to manifest himself in a peculiar manner present among them, he thought good to dwell amongst them in a visible and external manner; and therefore, while they were in the wilderness, and sojourned in tents, he would have a tent or tabernacle built, to sojourn with them also. - Now, the tabernacle being thus a house for God to dwell in visibly, to make up the notion of dwelling or habitation complete, there must be all things suitable to a house belonging to it. Hence, in the holy place, there must be a table and a candlestick, because these were the ordinary furniture of a room. The table must have its dishes, and spoons, and bowls, and covers, belonging to it, though they were never used; and always be furnished with bread upon it. The candlestick must have its lamps continually burning, etc." [[Exod.25|Exod 25:8]], [[Exod.36|Exod 36:8-19]], [[Exod.40|Exod 40:2]], [[Exod.40|Exod 40:17-19]]; [[1Chr.17|1Chr 17:1]], [[1Chr.21|1Chr 21:29]]; [[John.1|John 1:14]], [[John.2|John 2:21]]; [[Heb.8|Heb 8:2]]; [[Heb.9|Heb 9:9]], [[Heb.9|Heb 9:23-24]]; [[Rev.21|Rev 21:3]]

It may, however, denote an animal; for Dr. Geddes remarks, had the sacred writer meant to express only a variety of colour, he would hardly have repeated ***oroth***, skins, after ***meoddamim***, red, in [[Exod.25|Exod 25:5]].

[^45]: The Hebrew ***waveyhem***, which we translate their hooks, is rendered by the LXX <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>κεφαλιδες</span></span>, and by the Vulgate, ***capiata***, capitals. Hence Calmet contends:

[^46]: 1. That if Moses does not mean the capitals of the pillars by this word, he mentions them nowhere else; and it would seem strange, that while he describes them with so much exactness, that he should not mention the capitals; or that pillars every way so correctly formed, should have been destitute of this necessary ornament.

[^47]:  2. As Moses was commanded to make the ***wavim*** of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver ([[Exod.27|Exod 27:10-11]]), and the ***wavim*** of the pillars of the vail of gold ([[Exod.36|Exod 36:36]]), and that 1,775 shekels were employed in making them, overlaying their ***chapiters***, ***rasheyhem***, their heads, and filleting them ([[Exod.38|Exod 38:28]]), it is more reasonable to suppose that all this is spoken of the capitals of pillars, than of any kind of hooks, especially as hooks are mentioned under the word taches or clasps. But as the root ***wavah*** seems to signify to connect (for yww, in Arabic, is to marry a wife), and as the letter ww, ***wav***, if it has not its name from its hook-like form, is yet used as a connective particle, it would rather appear to denote hooks, which connected the curtains or vails to the pillars. The LXX also render it <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>αγκυλαι</span></span>, "handles", and <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>κρικοι</span></span>, "rings" or "clasps".

[^55]: This may be termed the first vail, as it occupied the door or entrance to the tabernacle; the vail that separated the Holy of Holies is called the second vail, [[Heb.9|Heb 9:3]]. Mr. Morier (Second Journey Through Persia, p. 251), describing the tent of a chief of the Eelauts, says, "It was composed of a wooden frame of circular laths, which were fixed on the ground, and then covered over with large felts, that were fastened down by a cord, ornamented by tassels of various colours. A curtain, curiously worked by the women, with coarse needle-work of various colours, was suspended over the door. In the king of Persia's tents, magnificent ***perdahs***, or hangings of needle-work, are suspended, as well as on the doors of the great mosques in Turkey; and these circumstances combined, will, perhaps, illustrate [[Exod.26|Exod 26:36]]."
