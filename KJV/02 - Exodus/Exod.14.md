[^4]: ***Pi̇hachiroth***, "the mouth of Chiroth," as it is rendered by the LXX. Dr. Shaw is of opinion, that ***Chiroth*** denotes the valley which extends from the wilderness of Etham to the Red Sea. "This valley," he observes, "ends at the sea in a small bay made by the eastern extremities of the mountains (of Gewoubee and Attackah, between which the valley lies) which I have been describing, and is called ***Tiah***-***Beni***-***Israel***, i.e., the road of the Israelites, by a tradition that is still kept up by the Arabs, of their having passed through it; so it is also called Baideah, from the new and unheard of miracle that was wrought near it, by dividing the Red sea, and destroying therein Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen."

[^5]: The word ***Migdol*** signifies a tower, and hence some have supposed that it was a fortress which served to defend the bay. But the LXX render it <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>Μαγδωλος</span></span>, Magdolus, which is mentioned by Herodotus, Hecateus, and others, and is expressly said by Stephanus (de Urb.) to be <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>πολις</span> <span class='asgreek'>Αιγυπτον</span></span>, "a city of Egypt."

[^6]: This may have been the name of a town or city in which Baal was worshipped; and probably called ***zephon***, from being situated on the north point of the Red sea, near the present Suez.

[^35]: This sea was what is called in Scripture ***yam suph***, "the sea of weeds;" so called, according to Mr. Bruce, from the vast quantity of coral which grows in it. In the LXX it is called <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>θαλασσα</span> <span class='asgreek'>ερυθρα</span></span>, and by the Latins ***Rubrum mare***, and we from them the Red Sea; so called it is supposed, from ***Edom*** (red) or Esau, whose territories extend to its coasts. It separates Arabia from Egypt and Ethiopia, and is computed to be 150 leagues in length from Suez to the straits of Babelmandel. The upper part is divided into two gulfs, that to the East called the Elanitic, from the city Elana at the northern extremity, and that to the west, the Heroopolitic, from the city of Heroopolis. The former is called by the Arabians ***Bahr el Akaba***, the sea of Akaba; and the latter ***Bahr el Kolzum***, the sea of destruction, or ***Clysm<span class='asgreek'>ζ</span>***; which was that which the Israelites passed.
