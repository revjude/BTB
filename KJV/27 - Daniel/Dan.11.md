[^59]: From the preceding verses in this chapter let us learn:

[^60]: 1. That God, in his providence, sets up one and pulls down another, as he pleases.

[^61]:  2. That this world is full of wars and fightings, which result from the indulgence of the lusts of men.

[^62]:  3. That all the changes and revolutions of states were plainly and perfectly foreseen by the God of heaven.

[^63]:  4. That no word of God can fall to the ground, but what he has declared shall infallibly come to pass.

[^64]: For the elucidation of the historical parts of Scripture, it is advantageous to notice the writings of heathen authors. Light is thus thrown on many passages of Holy Writ, by shewing the accomplishment of the prophecies therein contained, or customs elucidated, which, in the course of years, or in our more northern latitude, would be to us inexplicable. We have therefore reason to bless God for human learning, by which many have done great service to the readers of His blessed word.

The conversion of Constantine, though it stopped the rage of persecution, gave but little help to true religion. The power first exercised by the emperors, in calling and influencing ecclesiastical councils, gradually passed into the hands of the clergy; and the bishop and church of Rome at last carried it to an enormous length, magnifying themselves above every god.
