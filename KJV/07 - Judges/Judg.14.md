[^23]: "It resembles that of the ancient patriarchs, as represented in paintings (but the paintings are taken from Asiatic models); that of the men consists of a red cap and turban, a (***kumja***) shirt, which hangs outside of the drawers, and comes below the knee; a (***caftan***) coat, which buttons close before, and down to the bottom with large open sleeves; over which, when they go out of doors, they throw carelessly, and sometimes elegantly, a ***hayk***, or garment of white cotton, silk, or wool, five or six yards long, and five feet wide. The Arabs often dispense with the ***caftan***, and even with the shirt, wearing nothing but the ***hayk***."
