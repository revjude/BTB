It is well known that several nations cannot pronounce certain letters. The sound of th cannot be pronounced by the Persians, no more than by some of our Continental neighbours; though it is a common sound among the Arabians. To this day, many of the German Jews cannot articulate ***ϊ*** ***th***, for which they substitute ***ss***; thus for ***baith***, a house, they say ***baiss***.
