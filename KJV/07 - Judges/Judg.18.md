[^53]: Probably the people of Laish were originally a colony of the Zidonians; who being an opulent people, and in possession of a strong city, lived in a state of security, not being afraid of their neighbours. In this the Leshemites imitated them, though they appear not to have had the same reason for their confidence; and though they might naturally expect help from their countrymen, yet as they lived at a considerable distance from Sidon, the Danites saw they could strike the blow before the news of the invasion could reach that city.

[[Ps.105|Ps 105:44-45]]. But the first thing they do after they are settled is to break his laws, by setting up the graven image, attributing their success to that idol, which, if God had not been infinitely patient, would have been their ruin. Thus a prosperous idolater goes on to offend, imputing this his power unto his God. Instead of Manasseh, some would read Moses; as it is found in some manuscripts, in the Vulgate and in the concessions of the most intelligent Jews. But Bp. Patrick takes this to be an idle conceit of the Rabbins, and supposes this Jonathan to be of some other family of the Levites. Yet Kimchi acknowledges, that the Jews, deeply concerned for the honour of their lawgiver, to whom they thought it would be a great dishonour to have a grandson who was an idolater, suspended the letter, <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>π</span></span>, ***noon***, over the word <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>ξωΡ</span></span> (<span class="ashebrew">‎מֹשֶׁה‎</span><sup><small>[[H4872]]</small></sup>), (<span class="asaramaic">‎מֹשֶׁה‎</span><sup><small>[[H4873]]</small></sup>), Moses, thus <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>ξπωΡδ</span></span> (<span class="ashebrew">‎מְנַשֶּׁה‎</span><sup><small>[[H4519]]</small></sup>), as it is found in the Hebrew Bibles; which, by means of the points, they have changed into Manasseh.

[^59]: Houbigant contends, that, instead of ***haaretz***, "the land," we should read ***haaron***, "the ark;" for the <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>ε</span></span>, ***wav***, and <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>ο</span></span>, ***noon final***, might easily be mistaken for <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>υ</span></span>, ***tzadday final***; which is the only difference between the two words. This conjecture is the more likely, as the next verse tells us, that Micah's graven image continued at Dan "all the time that the house of God was at Shiloh;" which was till the ark was taken by the Philistines.
