 $\quad$ <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Judg.15.1|1]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid<small><small>[^2]</small></small>; and he said, I will go<small><small>[^3]</small></small> in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in. <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Judg.15.2|2]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> And her father said, I verily<small><small>[^4]</small></small> thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave<small><small>[^5]</small></small> her to thy companion: \[is\] not her younger sister fairer than she? take her<small><small>[^6]</small></small>, I pray thee, instead of her.

$\quad$ <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Judg.15.6|6]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> [¶]Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion.

$\quad$ <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Judg.15.7|7]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> [¶]And Samson said unto them, Though<small><small>[^18]</small></small> ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease. <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Judg.15.8|8]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.<small><small>[^19]</small></small>

[^9]: Dr. Kennicott and others contend, that for ***shualim***, "foxes," we should read ***shoalim***, "handfuls," or sheaves of corn. But:

[^10]: or, torches

[^11]: 1. The word ***lachad***, rendered caught, never signifies simply to get or take but always to catch, seize, or take by assault or stratagem.

[^12]:  2. Though the proposed alteration is sanctioned by seven manuscripts, yet all the versions are on the other side.

[^13]:  3. Admitting this alteration, it will be difficult to prove that the word ***shoal*** means either a sheaf or a handful of corn in the ear, and straw. It occurs but thrice in Scriptures ([[1Kgs.20|1Kgs 20:10]]. [[Isa.40|Isa 40:12]]. [[Ezek.13|Ezek 13:9]]): where it evidently means as much as can be contained in the hollow of the hand; but when handfuls of grain in the shock, or sheaves are intended, very different words are used. See note on [[Ruth.2|Ruth 2:15-16]], etc.

[^14]:  4. It is not hinted that Samson collected them alone, or in one day; he might have employed many hands and several days in the work.

[^15]:  5. The word ***shual*** properly denotes the jackal, which travellers describe as an animal in size between the wolf and fox, gregarious, as many as 200 having been seen together, and the most numerous of any in eastern countries; so that Samson might have caught many of them together in nets.

[^32]: Some would render the words ***aileph ish***, "a chief;" but it is ***alluph***, and not ***aileph***, which signifies a chief; besides which, the Hebrew idiom would, even in that case, require it to be ***ish alluph***, "a man, a chief," and not ***alluph ish***, "a chief, a man." Add to which, that every version renders it "a thousand men."

[^33]: There is here a fine paronomasia upon the word ***chamor***, "an ass," which also signifies "a heap;" ***bilchee hachamor, chamor chamorathayim***, "With the jaw-bone of an ass, a heap upon two heaps."

[^34]: Heb. an heap, two heaps, [[Judg.15|Judg 15:16]]

[^35]: that is, the lifting up of the jaw-bone, or, the casting away of the jaw-bone, [[Judg.15|Judg 15:17]]

[^43]: [[Gen.45|Gen 45:27]]; [[1Sam.30|1Sam 30:12]]; [[Isa.40|Isa 40:26]]

[^44]: Samson gave this expressive name to the miraculously springing water, to be as a memorial of the goodness of God to him. En–hakkore, the well of him that cried, which kept him in remembrance both of his own distress which caused him to cry, and the favour of Jehovah to him in answer to his cry. Many a spring of comfort God opens to his people, which may fitly be called by the name En–hakkore, and this instance of Samson's relief should encourage us to trust in God, for when he pleases he can open rivers in high places. [[Isa.41|Isa 41:17-18]]; Samson at first gave the name of Ramath–lehi (the lifting up of the jaw-bone) which denoted him great and triumphant, but now he gives it another name, En–hakkore, which denotes him wanting and dependent.
