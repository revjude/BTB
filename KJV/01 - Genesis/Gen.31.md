[^66]: The word, ***car***, rendered "furniture," properly denotes "a large round pannier," placed one on each side of a camel, for a person, especially women, to ride in. It is a hamper, like a cradle, having a back, head, and sides, like a great chair. Moryson describes them as "two long chairs like cradles, covered with red cloth, to hang on the two sides of the camel." Hanway calls them ***kedgavays***, which "are a kind of covered chairs, which the Persians hang over their camels in the manner of panniers, and are big enough for one person to sit in." Thevenot, who calls then ***counes***, says that they lay over them a cover, which keeps then both from the rain and sun; and Maillet describes them as covered cages, hanging on each side of a camel. The late Editor of Calmet has furnished a correct delineation of these ***cars***, as seen on one side of a camel, copied from Dalton's Prints of Egyptian Figures.

[^90]: The word ***gal***, rendered "heap," properly signifies a round heap or circle; probably like the Druidical remains in this country, which have been traced in India, Persia, Western Asia, Greece, and Northern Europe. These usually consist of irregular circles of large stones, with a principal one in the midst; the former probably being used for seats, and the latter for an altar; corresponding to the stone set up as a pillar by Jacob, and the heap of stones collected by his brethren. They appear to have been used, as Gilgal undoubtedly was ([[Josh.4|Josh 4:5]]; [[Judg.2|Judg 2:1]]; [[Judg.3|Judg 3:19]]; [[Judg.20|Judg 20:1-48]]; [[1Sam.7|1Sam 7:16]]; [[1Sam.10|1Sam 10:8]], [[1Sam.10|1Sam 10:17]]; [[1Sam.11|1Sam 11:15]]; [[1Sam.13|1Sam 13:7]]; [[1Sam.15|1Sam 15:33]].
