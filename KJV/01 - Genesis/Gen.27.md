As eating and drinking were used among the Asiatics on almost all religious occasions, and especially in making and confirming covenants, it is reasonable to suppose, that something of this kind was essentially necessary on this occasion; and that Isaac could not convey the right, till he had eaten of the meat provided for the purpose by him who was to receive the blessing.

[^20]: Heb. desirable, [[Gen.27|Gen 27:27]]; The Septuagint translates it "a goodly robe," which was a long garment that great men used to wear ([[Luke.20|Luke 20:46]]; [[Luke.15|Luke 15:22]]). The priest afterwards in the law had "holy garments" to minister in ([[Exod.28|Exod 28:2-4]]). Whether the first-born before the law had such to minister in is not certain: for, had they been common garments, why did not Esau himself or his wives keep them? But being, in likelihood, holy robes, received from their ancestors, the mother of the family kept them in sweet chests, from moths and the like; whereupon it is said ([[Gen.27|Gen 27:27]]), "Isaac smelled the smell of his garments."

[^21]: Travellers inform us, that the Eastern goats have long, fine, and beautiful hair, of the most delicate silky softness; indeed the animals generally in those hot countries are not covered with so thick a coat of hair as they are in more northerly regions; so that Isaac might easily be deceived, when his eyes were dim, and his feeling no less impaired than his sight.

Scarcely any two of the innumerable millions are exactly alike in either, and yet the difference cannot be defined or described! The power, wisdom, and kindness of our Creator should be admired and adored in this remarkable circumstance; for they are very visible. This description of Jacob is not unaptly accommodated to the character of a hypocrite. His voice, his language, is that of a Christian; his hands, or conduct, that of an ungodly man, but the judgment will proceed from God, the Judge of all, at the last day, as in the present case, not by the voice, but by the hands.
