[^62]: As ***shachah***, which primarily signifies to bow, denotes also to worship; and as ***mittah***, a bed, pronounced ***matteh***, is a staff; the LXX have taken the passage in the latter sense, and rendered it <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>και</span> <span class='asgreek'>προσεκυνησεν</span> <span class='asgreek'>Ισραηλ</span> <span class='asgreek'>επι</span> <span class='asgreek'>το</span> <span class='asgreek'>ακρον</span> <span class='asgreek'>της</span> <span class='asgreek'>ραβδου</span> <span class='asgreek'>αυτου</span></span>, "and Israel worshipped upon the top of his staff," which is literally copied by the apostle Paul, in his Epistle to the Hebrews. The present reading is, however, supported by the Masoretic pointing and the Targums; and is most probably correct, as it would appear that Jacob was confined to his bed.
