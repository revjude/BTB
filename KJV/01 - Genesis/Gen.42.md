Our word inn here gives us a false idea, there were no such places of entertainment in the desert which Joseph's brethren had to pass; nor are there any at the present day. The only accommodation such a place affords is either a well, or a ***khan***, or ***caravanserai***, which is generally no more than four bare walls, perfectly exposed, the place being open at the top, and furnishing a wretched lodging, and even these, it is probable, were not in use at this early period.
