[^2]: As there cannot be above 23 years from the selling of Joseph, unto Israel's going down into Egypt; and as it is impossible that Judah should take a wife, and by her have three sons successively, and Shelah, the youngest, marriageable when Judah begat Pharez of Tamar, and Pharez be grown up, married, and have two sons, all within so short a period; Mr. Ainsworth conceives that the time here spoken of is soon after Jacob's coming to Shechem ([[Gen.33|Gen 33:1]]). We have accordingly adapted the chronology to correspond with that time.

[^40]: ***Pathil***, from ***pathal***, to twist, wreathe, may denote either a wreath for the arm or neck, a twisted collar, or bracelet.
