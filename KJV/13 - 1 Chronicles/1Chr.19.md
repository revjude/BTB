[^21]: Thirty-two thousand soldiers, exclusive of the thousand sent by the king of Maachah, are mentioned in the parallel passage ([[2Sam.10|2Sam 10:6]]); but of chariots or cavalry there is no mention; and the number of chariots stated here is prodigious, and beyond all credibility. But as the word ***raichev*** denotes not only a chariot, but a rider (see [[Isa.21|Isa 21:7]]), it ought most probably to be rendered here, in a collective sense, cavalry; and then the number of troops will exactly agree with the passage in Samuel. It is probable that they were a kind of auxiliary troops who were usually mounted on horses, or in chariots, but who occasionally served as foot-soldiers.

[^22]: This variation exists only in the translation, the original being the same in both places, ***melech maachah***, "the king of Maachah." [[2Sam.10|2Sam 10:6]], king Maachah

[^41]: This variation arises from the permutation of <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>α</span></span>, ***baith***, and <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>τ</span></span>, ***pay***; being written in the parallel passage <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>ωΡεακ</span></span> (<span class="ashebrew">‎שׁוֹבָךְ‎</span><sup><small>[[H7731]]</small></sup>), ***Shobach***, and here <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>ωΡετκ</span> </span> (<span class="ashebrew">‎שׁוֹפָךְ‎</span><sup><small>[[H7780]]</small></sup>), ***Shophach*** [[2Sam.10|2Sam 10:16]], Shobach.

[^46]: In the parallel passage, "the men of seven hundred chariots;" which difference probably arose from mistaking <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>ο</span></span>, ***noon final***, which stands for 700, for <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>ζ</span></span>, ***zayin***, with a dot above, which denotes 7,000, or vice versa. The great similarity of these letters might easily cause the one to be mistaken for the other.
