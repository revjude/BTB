[^3]: This was probably the number returned by Joab and his assistants, when they made that census of the people with which God was so much displeased. We find that the effective men of Issachar amounted to 87,000 ([[1Chr.7|1Chr 7:5]]); 22,600 of whom descended from Tola his eldest son; but whether the 36,000 ([[1Chr.7|1Chr 7:4]]) were descendants of Tola by Uzzi, and the 22,600 his descendants by Tola's other sons; or whether another of Issachar's sons be intended, does not clearly appear; though the former seems the more obvious meaning. [[1Chr.21|1Chr 21:1-5]], [[1Chr.27|1Chr 27:1]], [[1Chr.27|1Chr 27:23-24]]; [[2Sam.24|2Sam 24:1-9]]

[^5]: In the parallel place of Genesis, ten sons of Benjamin are reckoned, Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard; and in Numbers, five only are mentioned, Bela, Ashbel, Ahiraim, Shupham, and Hupham; and Ard and Naaman are said to be the sons of Bela, and consequently Benjamin's grandsons. In the beginning of the following chapter, also, five are only mentioned, Bela, Ashbel, Aharah, Nohah, and Rapha; and Addar, Gera, Abihud, Abishua, Naaman, Ahoha, another Gera, Shephuphan, and Huram, are all represented as grandsons, not sons of Benjamin. Hence we see that in many cases, grandsons are called sons, and both are often confounded in the genealogical tables. It seems, also, that the persons mentioned in the following verses were neither sons nor grandsons of Bela and Becher, but distinguished persons among their descendants.

[^13]: ***Aher*** signifies another, and it has been conjectured that these were Danites, "the sons of another tribe;" especially as Hushim is named as the only son of Dan, [[Gen.46|Gen 46:23]]. And they suppose that the name of Dan was not mentioned, because his descendants first established idolatry. But Zebulun, as well as Dan, is here omitted, perhaps because none of either of these tribes returned at first from Babylon. Though the Benjamites had been almost destroyed in the first days of the judges, they soon became numerous and powerful. [[Num.26|Num 26:38]], Ahiram

[^17]: The text in these two verses seems to be strangely corrupted; and, as it stands, is scarcely intelligible. Probably it should be rendered, "The sons of Manasseh were Ashriel, whom his Syrian concubine bore to him; and Machir the father of Gilead, whom (his wife) bore to him. Machir took for a wife Maachah, sister to Huppim and Shuppim." This is nearly the version of Dr. Geddes.

This is the only place in the Sacred Writings where this piece of history is mentioned, and the transaction seems to have happened before the Israelites came out of Egypt; for it appears from the following verse, that Ephraim was alive when these children of his were slain.

See those of a similar character with this verse: [[Gen.35|Gen 35:18]], where Rachel, while dying, names her new-born son Ben–oni, or, the son of my sorrow. So in [[1Sam.4|1Sam 4:21]], the wife of Phinehas, on being apprised of the death of Eli and her husband, and that the ark was taken by the Philistines, while in the pains of travail, and dying, named her son I-chabod, or, there is no glory. So also in [[1Chr.9|1Chr 9:4]] of this book, we read that Jabez, or, sorrowful, had that name given to him, because his mother "bare him with sorrow." [[2Sam.23|2Sam 23:5]]
