[^4]: The variation in this name is occasioned simply by the transposition of a <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>γ</span></span>, ***daleth*** and <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>ψ</span></span>, ***raish***; being in the parallel passage ***ΰ<span class='asgreek'>ψγ</span>*** ( [[H0714|‎אַרְדְּ‎]] ), ***Ard***, and here ***ΰ<span class='asgreek'>γψ</span>*** ( [[H0146|‎אַדָּר‎]] ), ***Addar***.

[^13]: In the preceding verse it is said that "Hushim and Baara were his wives;" and here it said, "he begat of Hodesh his wife," etc; and then in the [[1Chr.8|1Chr 8:11]], his children by Hushim are mentioned, but not a word of Baara. It is probable, therefore, that Hodesh was another name for Baara; and this is asserted by the Targumist: "And he begat of Baara, that is, of Chodesh, his wife, so called because he espoused her anew."

[^14]: i.e. counselor; he will take counsel, ( [[H3263|‎יְעוּץ‎]] ).

[^18]: Lod, or Lydda, was situated about four leagues from Joppa, and a day's journey, or about thirty-two miles nw from Jerusalem; and, according to the Antonine Itinerary, twelve miles from Jamnia, eighteen from Eleutheropolis, and twenty two from Bethar. Josephus says it was a village, not yielding to a city in greatness; and that it was one of three toparchies dismembered from Samaria, and given to the Jews. It was destroyed by Cesitus in the Jewish war, and, when rebuilt, was called Diospolis. It is now called Loudd, and is a poor village, situated in a fine plain about a league to the e-ne of Ramia.

[^25]: Jerusalem, the ancient capital of Judea, is situated in long. 35 degrees 20 minutes e, lat. 31 degrees 47 minutes 47 seconds n; and, according to the best authorities, 136 miles sw of Damascus, 34 miles s of Shechem or Nablous, 45 miles e of Jaffa, 27 miles n of Hebron, and about 20 miles w of Jericho. The city of Jerusalem was built on hills, and encompassed with mountains ([[Ps.125|Ps 125:2]]), in a stony and barren soil, and was about sixteen furlongs in length, say Strabo. The ancient city of Jebus, taken by David from the Jebusites, was not large, and stood on a mountain south of that on which the temple was erected. Here David built a new city, called the city of David, wherein was the royal palace. Between these two mountains lay the valley of Millo, filled up by David and Solomon; and after the reign of Manasseh, another city is mentioned, called the second. The Maccabees considerably enlarged Jerusalem on the north, enclosing a third hill; and Josephus mentions a fourth hill, called Bezetha, which Agrippa joined to the former. This new city lay north of the temple, along the brook Kidron. See note on [[1Chr.9|1Chr 9:34]].
