In the New Testament, however, it denotes a prince, or king, who reigns over the fourth part of a former kingdom. By Herod's will his kingdom was thus divided among his sons: Archelaus had one-half, consisting of Idumea, Judea, and Samaria; Herod Antipas, one-fourth, consisting of Galilee and Perea; and Philip the remaining fourth, consisting of Batanea, Trachonitis, and Auranitis.
