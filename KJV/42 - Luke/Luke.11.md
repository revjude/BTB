The reasoning of the Pharisees ([[Luke.11|Luke 11:17]], and [[Matt.12|Matt 12:24-25]]), was not expressed, and Jesus knowing their thoughts, gave ample proof of his omniscience. This, with our Lord's masterly confutation of their reasonings, by a conclusion drawn from their own premises, one would have supposed might have humbled and convinced those men; but the most conclusive reasoning, and the most astonishing miracles, were lost upon a people who were obstinately determined to disbelieve every thing that was good relative to Jesus of Nazareth.
