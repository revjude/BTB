[^34]: Do not consider him as an innocent man; for, as thou art a wise man, and knowest how to treat such persons, treat him as he deserves; only, as I have sworn to him that I would not put him to death, "bring not his hoar head down to the grave with blood." So Solomon understood David; for, after he had commanded Joab to be slain, in obedience to his father, he sent for Shimei, and knowing he ought to be well watched, he confined him to Jerusalem for the rest of his life, and so it appears David should be understood; for the negative particle ***lo***, in the former clause, "hold him not guiltless," should be repeated in the latter clause, though not expressed; instances of which frequently occur in the Hebrew Scriptures.

[^60]: We have already seen, that the whole harem of an eastern monarch was a part of the regal succession (see note on [[2Sam.16|2Sam 16:23]]); and it was treason for a subject to claim any wife or virgin who had once formed a part of it. Solomon evidently considered the request of Adonijah in this light; and was convinced that he was still aiming to seize the crown, to which he considered this as one step. But it is very doubtful, how far the plea either of policy or state necessity can justify Solomon in thus embruing his hands in his brother's blood, whatever might have been his treasonable intentions or conduct.

God had told Eli ([[1Sam.2|1Sam 2:30-36]]) that the priesthood should depart from his house; Abiathar was the last of the priests of Ithamar, of which family was Eli the high priest. Zadok, who succeeded, was of the family of Eleazar; and by this change the priesthood reverted to its ancient channel.

[^101]: No doubt Solomon suspected that Shimei's influence would be dangerous upon his own estate and among his numerous dependents in different parts of the land; and therefore he proposed to him, as the condition of his indemnity for former crimes, that he should live in Jerusalem under his eye, and by no means remove thence. These terms Shimei readily agreed to, and solemnly swore to observe them; and for three years he lived unmolested and in affluence. But growing secure, in contempt of Solomon's authority and of the oath of God, upon an unnecessary business he took a journey, which according to his own engagement forfeited his life. Thus the Lord left him to be infatuated, that due punishment might be inflicted upon him; in order that every ringleader of opposition to Solomon's kingdom might be crushed, and others be intimidated by their examples. Solomon's throne by the death of this man was established in peace, and became a type of the Redeemer's kingdom of peace and righteousness. - Scott.
