***Nehemiah Sent to Jerusalem*** ^bsb1197

 $\quad$ <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Neh.2.1|1]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> And it came to pass in the month Nisan<small><small>[^2]</small></small>, in the twentieth<small><small>[^3]</small></small> year of Artaxerxes the king, \[that\] wine \[was\] before him: and I took up<small><small>[^4]</small></small> the wine, and gave \[it\] unto the king. Now I had not been \[beforetime\] sad in his presence. <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Neh.2.2|2]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> Wherefore the king said unto me, Why \[is\] thy<small><small>[^5]</small></small> countenance sad, seeing thou \[art\] not sick? this \[is\] nothing \[else\] but sorrow<small><small>[^6]</small></small> of heart. Then I<small><small>[^7]</small></small> was very sore afraid, <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Neh.2.3|3]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> And said unto the king, Let the king<small><small>[^8]</small></small> live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city<small><small>[^9]</small></small>, the place<small><small>[^10]</small></small> of my fathers’ sepulchres, \[lieth\] waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire? <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Neh.2.4|4]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> Then the king said unto me, For what<small><small>[^11]</small></small> dost thou make request? So I prayed<small><small>[^12]</small></small> to the God of heaven. <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Neh.2.5|5]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> And I said unto the king, If it please<small><small>[^13]</small></small> the king, and if thy<small><small>[^14]</small></small> servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers’ sepulchres, that I may build it. <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Neh.2.6|6]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> And the king said unto me, (the queen<small><small>[^15]</small></small> also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return?

***Nehemiah Inspects the Walls*** ^bsb1198

 <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Neh.2.11|11]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.<small><small>[^31]</small></small>

$\quad$ <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Neh.2.17|17]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> [¶]Then said I unto them, Ye see<small><small>[^43]</small></small> the distress that we \[are\] in, how Jerusalem \[lieth\] waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come<small><small>[^44]</small></small>, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach<small><small>[^45]</small></small>. <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Neh.2.18|18]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> Then I told them of the hand<small><small>[^46]</small></small> of my God which was good upon me; as also the king’s words that he had spoken unto me.

[^1]:  [[Neh.2|Neh 2:1]], Artaxerxes, understanding the cause of Nehemiah’s sadness, sends him with letters and commission to Jerusalem; [[Neh.2|Neh 2:9]], Nehemiah, to the grief of the enemies, comes to Jerusalem; [[Neh.2|Neh 2:12]], He views secretly the ruins of the walls; [[Neh.2|Neh 2:17]], He incites the Jews to build.

[^7]: Probably the king spoke as if he had some suspicion that Nehemiah harboured some bad design, and that his face indicated some conceived treachery, or remorse; and, indeed, the words rendered sad, and sorrow of heart, might be rendered evil, and wickedness of heart.

[^8]: Far from wishing ill to my master, I wish him to live forever. [[1Kgs.1|1Kgs 1:31]]; [[Dan.2|Dan 2:4]], [[Dan.3|Dan 3:9]], [[Dan.5|Dan 5:10]], [[Dan.6|Dan 6:6]], [[Dan.6|Dan 6:21]]

[^17]: It is probable that this time was no more than six months, or a year; after which he either returned, or had his leave of absence lengthened, as we find he was twelve years governor of the Jews. [[Neh.5|Neh 5:14]], [[Neh.13|Neh 13:6]]

[^41]: The gate leading to the valley of Jehoshaphat, east of the city, through which the brook Kidron flows. It was by this gate he went out; so that he went round the whole of the city, and entered by the same gate. [[Neh.2|Neh 2:13]]

Our prayers must be seconded with our serious endeavours, or else we mock God. Nearly four months had passed, namely, from Chisleu to Nisan (November to March), before Nehemiah made his application to the king for leave to go to Jerusalem; either because the winter was not a proper time for such a journey, and he would not make a motion till he could pursue it, or because it was so long before his month of waiting upon the king came, and there was no coming into his presence until called for, [[Esth.4|Esth 4:11]]. We are not thus limited to certain moments in our addresses to the King of kings, but have liberty of access to him at all times; to the throne of grace we never come unseasonably.
