Allured by the prosperity of the Egyptians, they also connected themselves with them, and joined in their multiplied and abominable idolatries. And when Jehovah punished them by wars and famines, and by the Philistines, whose daughters are represented as ashamed of their enormous idolatries, instead of being amended, they formed alliances with the Assyrians, and worshipped their gods, and they even followed every idol which was worshipped between Canaan and Chaldea.

Having exposed their enormous crimes to view, He would pass sentence upon them: He would give Jerusalem into the hands of the Chaldeans, who would destroy the city and temple which they had polluted; level their cities and high places with the ground; slay, plunder, and enslave the people.
