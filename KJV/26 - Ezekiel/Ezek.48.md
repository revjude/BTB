[^8]: In this division of the Holy Land, a portion is laid out for each of the twelve tribes directly across the country, from east to west; and deducting the square of 25,000 reeds, or nearly fifty miles on each side, between Judah and Benjamin, for the priests, Levites, city, and temple, with the inheritance of the prince to the east and west (See note on [[Ezek.45|Ezek 45:1]]), from 280 miles, the length of the country from north to south, there will remain for each tribe a portion of less than twenty miles in width, and 150 in length. This division of the land entirely differs from that which was made in the days of Joshua, in which the tribes were not only differently placed, but confused and inter-mixed; while here distinct lots are assigned to each of the twelve tribes, in a regular mathematical form. Literally such a division never took place. It seems to denote the equality of privileges which subsists among all the tribes of Believers, of whatever nation, and whatever their previous character may have been.

[^26]: The holy oblation of 25,000 square reeds, or near fifty square miles, was divided into three parts from north to south (see note on [[Ezek.45|Ezek 45:1]]); a portion on the north of 10,000 reeds in width, and 25,000 in length, for the priests, in the midst of which was the sanctuary or temple, surrounded by a wall 500 reeds square ([[Ezek.48|Ezek 48:9-10]]; see note on [[Ezek.42|Ezek 42:15]]); next to this another portion of the same dimensions for the Levites ([[Ezek.48|Ezek 48:13-14]]); and on the south another portion of the same length, but only 5,000 reeds in breadth, for the city ([[Ezek.48|Ezek 48:15]]). The city was situated in the midst of this portion, being 4,500 reeds, or about nine miles square ([[Ezek.48|Ezek 48:30]]), having a suburb of 250 reeds, or about half a mile, on each side ([[Ezek.48|Ezek 48:17]]), leaving 10,000 reeds or nearly ten miles, on the east side, and the same on the west side, for the profit of those who serve the city out of all the tribes ([[Ezek.48|Ezek 48:18-19]]). On the east and west sides of this square of 25,000 reeds, is the portion of the prince; each of which, estimating the breadth of the land at 150 miles, would form a square of fifty miles. Thus the whole plan of the division of the country, laying out of the city, temple, and all its appendages, is perfectly regular and uniform; and would therefore convey to the minds of the Jews the most complete idea they were capable of conceiving of the most perfect church, commonwealth, city, temple, and conveniences, on the largest and grandest scale for the Divine worship; and it doubtless ultimately points out the land of Immanuel, the city of the New Jerusalem, and his temple, the Christian church, the house of the living God.

[^44]: It is certainly most obvious to interpret these measures, not of cubits, but of the measuring reed which the prophet's conductor had in his hand; according to which, the city would be about thirty-six miles in circumference, and nine miles on each side of the square; which was nearly nine times larger than the greatest extent to which Jerusalem ever attained (See note on [[Ezek.42|Ezek 42:15]], and see note on [[Ezek.42|Ezek 42:16]].) The large dimensions of the city and land were perhaps intended to intimate the extensive and glorious propagation of the gospel in the times predicted; and the land was not called Canaan, nor the city Jerusalem, probably because they were figurative of spiritual blessings to the church and to Israel.
