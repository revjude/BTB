For it is not only directed where he should sit in the temple, and eat his portion of the sacrifices, and when and how he should go out; but it is also ordered ([[Ezek.45|Ezek 45:22]]), that at the passover he shall offer a bullock, a sin offering for himself and the people; and to guard him against any temptation of oppressing the people, he had a provision of land allotted to him ([[Ezek.45|Ezek 45:8]]), out of which he is to give an inheritance for his sons ([[Ezek.46|Ezek 46:18]]). These appear plainly to be political rules for common princes, and for a succession of them; but as no such rules were observed under the second temple, the fulfilment of it must still be future.
