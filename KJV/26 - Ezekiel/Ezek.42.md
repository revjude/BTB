[^4]: This seems to denote a row of chambers in three stories; which appear to have been situated in the inner court (here called the outer court in reference to the temple, [[Ezek.42|Ezek 42:13-14]]), just before the separate place, at the entrance from the north. [[Ezek.42|Ezek 42:4]], [[Ezek.41|Ezek 41:9]], [[Ezek.41|Ezek 41:12-15]]

[^5]: Perhaps this means, that the north door was 100 cubits from the entrance into the court; and that the door-way, or portico, was 50 cubits in length; or, that it faced one of the cloisters, the length of which was 100 cubits, and its breadth 50, which was the proportion of all the cloisters. [[Ezek.42|Ezek 42:2]]

[^6]: One side of these buildings looked upon the void space about the temple of twenty cubits, and the other toward the pavement belonging to the outer court.

[^32]: Estimating the reed at 10+ feet, 500 reeds will be nearly equal to a mile; so that from this statement we find the temple, with its outbuildings, was built on a square, nearly an English mile on each side, and four miles in circumference. This not only far exceeds the size of Solomon's temple, or that after the captivity, which was only 500 cubits, or a furlong, on each side, and exactly half a mile in circuit; but is nearly equal to the whole extent of Jerusalem itself, which, when greatest, was but 33 furlongs in circumference, somewhat less than 4+ miles. This seems clearly to intimate, that the vision cannot be explained of any temple that has hitherto been built, or indeed of any literal temple, but figuratively and mystically of the spiritual temple, the church under the gospel, and its spiritual glory.
