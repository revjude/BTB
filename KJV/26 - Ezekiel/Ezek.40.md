[^6]: There can be little doubt, that the grand outlines of the description of the temple, in the following extraordinary vision, were taken from that of Solomon's, with all the additions made to it in after ages; and we may suppose that Zerubbabel and the other Jews had respect to it, as far as circumstances would permit, in rebuilding the temple after the captivity. There are, however, many circumstances which conclusively shew, that something infinitely superior to either the first or second temple was intended; and that the external description must be considered as a figure and emblem of spiritual blessings. Probably the more immediate accomplishment of the prophecy will be subsequent to the conversion and restoration of the Jews, the destruction of Gog and Magog, and the pouring out of the Spirit, mentioned at the close of the last chapter; but whether there will be any external forms analogous to these cannot be determined, though in some respects it seems improbable.

[^27]: The entrance into the outer court seems to have been through a porch with doors at both ends; and on each side of this porch were three small chambers, or rooms, for the use of the porters, a reed square in size, with a passage of five cubits between them. The common cubit, termed the "cubit of a man," ([[Deut.3|Deut 3:11]]), was about 18 inches; but the cubit used by the angel was, as we learn from [[Ezek.43|Ezek 43:13]], "a cubit and a hand breadth," or about three inches more than the common cubit, that is 21 inches. Hence the measuring reed, which was "six cubits long, by the cubit and the hand breadth," ([[Ezek.40|Ezek 40:5]]), must have been about 10+ feet

[^31]: This was the whole length of the porch, from the outward front ([[Ezek.41|Ezek 41:21]], [[Ezek.41|Ezek 41:25]]), to the inner side which looks into the first court ([[Ezek.40|Ezek 40:17]]), including the thickness of the walls ([[Ezek.40|Ezek 40:6]]), chambers ([[Ezek.40|Ezek 40:7]]), and spaces between them.

[^49]: Or, "suitable to them," that is, to the arches of the east gate. The north gate into the outward court, and every thing belonging to it, were exactly the same as the east gate.

[^50]: That is, the gate of the inner court was opposite, and exactly answered to the gate of the outward court, both on the north and east side; and between the gates of the outward and inner court was a space of an hundred cubits.

[^61]: As the outward court inclosed the inner, the prophet was led from the south gate of the outward court to the south gate of the inner, which was opposite it, and so into the inner court itself.

[^62]: [[Ezek.40|Ezek 40:32]], [[Ezek.40|Ezek 40:35]]

[^63]: The entrance into the inner court seems to have been through a portico, exactly like that at each gate of the outward court; but the ascent was by eight steps, instead of seven.

[^64]: [[Ezek.40|Ezek 40:16]], [[Ezek.40|Ezek 40:22]], [[Ezek.40|Ezek 40:25]]

[^65]: These are supposed to have been built over the spaces which separated the little chambers, or porters' lodges.

[^67]: Instead of five cubits, it seems evident, from the parallel places, that we should read twenty-five. The word ***êsrim*** appears to have been lost out of the text.

[^76]: The north gate, as well as the east, was built in the same manner, and of the same dimensions, as the south gate. See the parallel passages.

[^81]: This place, where the legs and entrails of the sacrifices, especially of the burnt offerings, were washed, was just within the portico of the north entrance to the inner court, or court of the priests. An allusion to this is most probably made by the inspired apostle when writing his Epistle to the Hebrews ([[Heb.10|Heb 10:22]]). "Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water."

[^85]: [[Lev.5|Lev 5:6-13]], [[Lev.6|Lev 6:6]], [[Lev.7|Lev 7:1-2]]

[^86]: Two tables were on each side, as you come into the porch of the gate; and two on each side of the inner part of the gate that looked towards the altar; in all eight tables, on which they slew and cut up the victims. It does not appear that any such tables were used either in the tabernacle or temple; and this seems to intimate the introduction of a new and more spiritual dispensation. See the references.

[^87]: or, at the step, [[Ezek.40|Ezek 40:35]]

[^88]: These were probably for hanging up the victims in order to flay them.

[^89]: or, end-irons, or, the two hearth-stones

[^93]: The word chamber probably here denotes a row of chambers, of which there seems to have been three. One for the singers; one for the priests who in their courses took charge of the sacred vessels and treasures; and one for the priests who attended on the altar and sacrifices.

[^100]: This was the inner court, or court of the priests, which was of the same dimensions with each division of the outer court; and the altar stood directly before the porch of the temple.

[^101]: [[Ezek.40|Ezek 40:19]], [[Ezek.40|Ezek 40:23]], [[Ezek.40|Ezek 40:27]]

[^102]: The length of the porch was twenty cubits, the same as the breadth of the temple, and the breadth eleven cubits, that is, one cubit more than in Solomon's temple. Two bivalve, or folding doors, each leaf of them being three cubits wide, seem to have formed the entrance; which, with five cubits, perhaps of brick or stone work, one each side, called "the post of the porch," amount to sixteen cubits; and the other four cubits may be supposed to have been the distance from these posts to the outside walls of the temple. [[1Kgs.6|1Kgs 6:3]]; [[2Chr.3|2Chr 3:4]]

[^103]: This was a flight of steps which led from the inner court into the temple. [[Ezek.40|Ezek 40:31]], [[Ezek.40|Ezek 40:34]], [[Ezek.40|Ezek 40:37]]
