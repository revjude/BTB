[^25]: ***Tarshish*** is generally rendered by the LXX and the Vulgate the chrysolite, so called by the ancients (from <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>χρυσος</span></span> (<span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>χρψσος</span></span>) <small><sup>[[G5557]]</sup></small>, gold, and <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>λιθος</span></span> <small><sup>[[G3037]]</sup></small>, a stone), because of its fine gold yellow colour. It is now called by the moderns the topaz; is a very beautiful and valuable gem in its pure and perfect state, though very rarely found so; and the finer pieces of it are in hardness second only to the diamond. The Vulgate, however, in [[Ezek.1|Ezek 1:16]], renders, ***quasi visio maris*** "as the appearance of the seas," i.e., azure; and Dr. Geddes (on [[Exod.28|Exod 28:10]]) says, that, with Abarbanel, he believes the beryl to be intended. It is a pellucid gem, called by our lapidaries, ***aqua marina*** of a sea or bluish green colour, found in the East Indies and about the gold mines of Peru. The genuine beryl never receives any other mixture of colour; and in its perfect state approaches the hardness of garnet.

[^33]: In [[Ezek.1|Ezek 1:10]], instead of "the face of a cherub," it is "the face of an ox:" hence a cherub was in the likeness of an ox, at least as to its head. The extraordinary shape of these angelic beings, which appeared to the prophet in vision, is manifestly symbolical; for it is not to be supposed that these heavenly beings are really thus formed. The four faces, wings, and the arms of a man, denote the sublime qualities of these immediate ministers of the Deity; qualities entirely essential to fill up the extent of their duty. The face of a man denotes their intelligence; of a lion, their intrepid courage; of an ox, their patience and perseverance in labour; and of an eagle, their great penetration, their sublime sight into heavenly things, and their readiness to rise up into all that is great and divine. The wings being stretched out, signifies their readiness and rapidity in obeying the commands of their Master; the wings bent down, denotes their profound respect before the Lord of the Universe; and the man's arms under the wings, shew that zeal produces application and labour.
