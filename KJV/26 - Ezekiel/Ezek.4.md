[^1]:  [[Ezek.4|Ezek 4:1]], Under the type of a siege is shewn the time from the defection of Jeroboam to the captivity; [[Ezek.4|Ezek 4:9]], By the provision of the siege, is shewn the hardness of the famine.

Perhaps, however, it may here denote a flat tile, like a Roman brick, which were commonly used for tablets, as we learn from Pliny, Hist. Nat. 1. vii. c. 57.

[^14]: This represented the forty years during which gross idolatry prevailed in Judah, from the reformation of Josiah, bc 624, to the same final desolation of the land. Some think that the period of 390 days also predicts the duration of the siege of the Babylonians ([[Ezek.4|Ezek 4:9]]), deducting from it five months and twenty-nine days, when the besiegers went to meet the Egyptians ([[2Kgs.25|2Kgs 25:1-4]]; [[Jer.37|Jer 37:5]]); and that forty days may have been employed in desolating the temple and city.
