[^3]: Solomon's temple and the second temple were doubtless well supplied with water, probably conveyed there by means of pipes; but these waters flowed from the temple, not as a common sewer, but as a fertilizing river. A fountain producing abundance of water was not in the temple, and could not be there on the top of such a hill; and consequently these waters, as well as those spoken of by Joel and Zechariah, must be understood figuratively and typically. These waters doubtless were an emblem of the "gospel preached with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven;" and their gradual rise beautifully represents it progress, from small beginnings to an immensely large increase; and the latter part of the representation may relate to the times when it shall fill the earth, and produce the most extensive and important effects on the state of making in every nation.

[^49]: The Holy Land, as here described, extended from about 31 degrees to 35 degrees n lat. and from 34 degrees to 37 degrees e long.; being bounded on the north by a line drawn from the Mediterranean to Hamath; on the east by Damascus, Hauran, Gilead, and the land of Israel east of Jordan, unto the south of the Dead sea; on the south by Tamar and Kadesh, unto the river of Rhinocorura; and on the west by the Mediterranean sea, from the same point northward "till a man came over against Hamath;" and its length from north to south would be about 280 miles, and its breadth about 150 miles. The ten tribes, as well as Judah and Benjamin, were to be admitted to a full share in this inheritance, which seems to imply, that the future restoration to the promised land is predicted; while the admission of strangers who sojourned in the land to a share in the inheritance, as if native Israelites, plainly intimates the calling of the Gentiles into the church, and their joint inheritance of its privileges, and of the heavenly felicity.
