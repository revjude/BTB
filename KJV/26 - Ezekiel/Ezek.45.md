[^5]: That our translators rightly added the word reeds, is evident from the length and breadth of the sanctuary being exactly the same as before (compare [[Ezek.45|Ezek 45:2]] with [[Ezek.42|Ezek 42:16-19]]). Estimating the reed at 3+ yards, this holy oblation would constitute a square of nearly fifty miles on every side. From the north side a portion of nearly twenty miles in width, and nearly fifty in length, was appointed for the priests; and in the midst of this portion, the area of the sanctuary, about a mile square, to be enclosed by a wall ([[Ezek.45|Ezek 45:1-2]]). Next to this, on the south, was the Levites' portion, of the same dimensions as that of the priests' ([[Ezek.45|Ezek 45:5]]); and south of this was the portion for the city, of the same length as those of the priests and Levites, but only half the width ([[Ezek.45|Ezek 45:6]]). These three formed the square of 25,000 reeds, or nearly fifty miles; and that set apart for the prince, the breadth of which is not mentioned, extended in length from north to south, along the east and west sides of the square. As Canaan would not admit of so large a portion for the sanctuary, etc., this was no doubt intended to intimate the large extent of the church in the glorious times predicted.
