Dr. Lightfoot places it between Tiberias and Tarichea, about two miles from the former; and Dr. Richardson, in passing through the plain of Gennesaret, was told by the natives that the ruins of Capernaum were quite near. The Arab station and ruins mentioned by Mr. Buckingham, said to have been formerly called Capharnaoom, situated on the edge of the lake from nine to twelve miles nne of Tiberias, bearing the name of Talhewn, or as Burckhardt writes it, Tel Houm, appear too far north for its site.

[^71]: Galilee was a province of Palestine, being bounded, says Josephus, on the west by Ptolemais and mount Carmel; on the south by the country of Samaria and Scythopolis, on the river Jordan; on the east by the cantons of Hyppos, Gadara, and Gaulon; and on the north by the confines of the Tyrians. It was divided into Lower and Upper Galilee; - Upper Galilee, so called from its being mountainous, was termed Galilee of the Gentiles ([[Matt.4|Matt 4:15]]), because inhabited, says Strabo, by Egyptians, Arabians, and Phoenicians, and comprehended the tribes of Asher and Naphtali; the Lower Galilee contained the tribes of Zebulun and Issachar, and was sometimes termed the Great Field. It was, says Josephus, very populous and rich, containing 204 cities and towns.
