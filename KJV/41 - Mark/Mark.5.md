[^4]: Matthew gives a brief account of two demoniacs who were dispossessed on this occasion; but Mark and Luke omit the mention of one (who was perhaps not so remarkable). That these wretched men were not merely mad, as some suppose, but really possessed of evil spirits, appears clearly from the language employed, as well as from the narrative itself. Matthew expressly affirms that they were "possessed with devils," or demoniacs, <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>δαιμονιζομενοι</span></span> <small><sup>[[G1139]]</sup></small>; Mark says he had "an unclean spirit," i.e., a fallen spirit; and Luke asserts, that he "had devils (or demons) a long time," and was called Legion, "because many devils were entered into him." With supernatural strength the demons burst asunder the chains and fetters with which he was bound; they address Christ as the "Son of the most high God;" they beseech him to suffer them to enter into the swine; and when he had given them leave, they "went out and entered into the swine," etc.
