[^20]: "It appears to me more probable," says Dr. Doddridge, "that Matthew and Mark should have introduced this story out of its place - that Lazarus, if he made this feast (which is not expressly said by John), should have made use of Simon's house, as more convenient - and that Mary should have poured this ointment on Christ's head and body, as well as on his feet - than that, within the compass of four days, Christ should have been twice anointed with so costly a perfume; and that the same fault should be found with the action, and the same value set upon the ointment, and the same words used in defence of the woman, and all this in the presence of many of the same persons; all which improbable particulars must be admitted, if the stories be considered as different." The rebuke which Judas received from Christ at this unction determined him in his resolution to betray his Master; and therefore Christ's rebuke, and Judas's revenge, are united, as cause and effect, by Matthew and Mark.

From various examples produced by Lightfoot, and Schoetgen, it appears that the Galileans used a very corrupt dialect and pronunciation; interchanging the gutturals, and other letters, and so blending or dividing words as to render them unintelligible, or convey a contrary sense. Thus when a Galilean would have asked, ***ΰ<span class='asgreek'>ξψ</span> <span class='asgreek'>μξ</span>ΰ<span class='asgreek'>ο</span>*** ( [[H0563|‎אִמַּר‎]] ), "whose is this lamb," he pronounced the first word so confusedly that it could not be known whether he meant <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>ηξψ</span></span> ( [[H2543|‎חֲמוֹר‎]] ), "an ass," <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>ηξψ</span></span> ( [[H2562|‎חֲמַר‎]] ), "wine," <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>ςξψ</span></span> ( [[H6015|‎עֲמַר‎]] ), "wool," or <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>ςιξψ</span></span> ( [[H0563|‎אִמַּר‎]] ), "a lamb." A certain woman intending to say to a judge, "My lord, I had a picture which they stole; and it was so great, that if you had been placed in it, your feet would not have touched the ground," so spoiled it by her pronunciation, that her words meant, "Sir slave, I had a beam, and they stole thee away; and it was so great, that if they had hung thee on it, thy feet would not have touched the ground."
