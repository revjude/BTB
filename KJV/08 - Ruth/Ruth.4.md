***Boaz Redeems Ruth*** ^bsb654

 $\quad$ <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Ruth.4.1|1]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> Then went Boaz up to the gate<small><small>[^2]</small></small>, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman<small><small>[^3]</small></small> of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such<small><small>[^4]</small></small> a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down. <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Ruth.4.2|2]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> And he took ten men of the elders<small><small>[^5]</small></small> of the city, and said, Sit ye down here.

If thou wilt redeem \[it\], redeem \[it\]: but if thou wilt not redeem \[it\], \[then\] tell me, that I may know: for \[there is\] none<small><small>[^10]</small></small> to redeem \[it\] beside thee; and I \[am\] after thee. And he said, I will redeem \[it\]. <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Ruth.4.5|5]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> Then said Boaz, What day<small><small>[^11]</small></small> thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy \[it\] also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up<small><small>[^12]</small></small> the name of the dead upon his inheritance. 

$\quad$ <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Ruth.4.6|6]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> [¶]And the kinsman said, I cannot<small><small>[^13]</small></small> redeem \[it\] for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem \[it\]. <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Ruth.4.7|7]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> Now this \[was the manner\] in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off<small><small>[^14]</small></small> his shoe, and gave \[it\] to his neighbour: and this \[was\] a testimony in Israel. <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Ruth.4.8|8]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy \[it\] for thee.

[^11]: Or rather, according to the emendations proposed by Houbigant and Dr. Kennicott, and which have been confirmed by a great many manuscripts since collated, and agreeably to the ancient versions, "In the day thou purchasest the land from the hand of Naomi, thou wilt also acquire Ruth, the Moabitess, the wife of the dead," etc. This is Boaz's statement of the case to his kinsman, before the people and elders.

[^13]: The Targum seems to give the proper sense of this passage: "I cannot redeem it, because I have a wife already; and it is not fit for me to bring another into my house, lest brawling and contention arise in it; and lest I hurt my own inheritance. Do thou redeem it, for thou has no wife; which hinders me from redeeming it." [[Ruth.4|Ruth 4:6]]

[^14]: This custom does not refer to the law about refusing to marry a brother's widow, but was usual in the transfer of inheritances. For this relative was not a brother, but simply a kinsman; and the shoe was not pulled off by Ruth, but by the kinsman himself. The Targumist, instead of his shoe, renders "his right hand glove," it probably being the custom, in his time, to give that instead of a shoe. Jarchi says, "When we purchase anything new, it is customary to give, instead of a shoe, a handkerchief or veil." [[Deut.25|Deut 25:7-10]]
