[^6]: It is probable that the winnowing of grain was effected by taking up a portion of the corn in a sieve, and letting it down slowly in the wind; thus the grain would, by its own weight, fall in one place, while the chaff, etc., would be carried a distance by the wind. It is said here that this was done at night; probably what was threshed out in the day was winnowed in the evening, when the sea breeze set in, which was common in Palestine.

[^12]: Such was the simplicity of those early times, that the most wealthy persons looked after their own affairs, both at home and in the field. These threshing-floors were covered at top to keep off the rain, but lay open on all sides, that the wind might come in freely, for winnowing the corn; which being done, it is probable they were shut up at night, with doors fitted to them, that if any one lay there he might be kept warm, and the corn be secured from robbers.

[^24]: The quantity of this barley is uncertain. The Targum renders it, ***shith sein***, "six ***seahs***." A ***seah*** contained about two gallons and a half, six of which must have been a very heavy load for a woman, and so the Targumist thought, for he adds, "And she received strength from the Lord to carry it."

[^25]: ***veil*** or sheet, or apron, The word ***mitpachath*** has been variously rendered. The LXX translate it <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>περιζωμα</span></span>, an apron, and Vulgate, ***pallium***, a cloak. By the circumstances of the story, it must have been of a considerable size; and accordingly Dr. Shaw thinks it was no other than the ***hyke***, the finer sort of which, such as are still worn by ladies and persons of distinction among the Arabs, he takes to answer to the <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>πεπλος</span></span>, or robe, of the ancient Greeks.
