***Haman’s Plot against the Jews*** ^bsb1231

[^1]:  [[Esth.3|Esth 3:1]], Haman, advanced by the king, and despised by Mordecai, seeks revenge upon all the Jews; [[Esth.3|Esth 3:7]], He casts lots; [[Esth.3|Esth 3:8]], He obtains by calumniation a decree of the king to put the Jews to death.

Had this meant only civil reverence the king would not have needed to command it; nor would Mordecai have refused it; there was, therefore, some kind of divine honour intended, such as was paid to the Persian kings, and which even the Greeks refused, as express adoration.

[^8]: ***the king's servants*** Dr. Shaw, speaking of the cities in the East, says, "If we quit the streets, and enter into any of the principal houses, we shall first pass through a porch, or gate-way, with benches on each side, where the master of the family receives visits, and despatches business; few persons, not even the nearest relations, having admission any farther, except upon extraordinary occasions." These servants were probably officers who here waited the king's call; and it is likely that Mordecai was one of them. [[Esth.2|Esth 2:19]], [[Esth.2|Esth 2:21]]

Ten thousand talents of silver, counted by the Babylonish talent, amount to 2,119,000£.; but reckoned by the Jewish talent, they amount to double that sum. In those days, silver and gold were more plentiful than at present; and we have many instances of individuals possessing almost incredible riches. Herodotus relates, that when Xerxes went into Greece, Pythius the Lydian had 2,000 talents of silver, and 4,000,000 of gold darics, which unitedly amount to nearly 5,500,000£. Plutarch tells us, that after Crassus had dedicated the tenth of all he had to Hercules, he entertained the Roman people at 10,000 tables, and distributed to every citizen as much corn as was sufficient for three months; and, after all these expenses, he had 7,100; Roman talents left, which amount to more than 1,500,000£. Lentulus the augur is said to have possessed no less than 3,333,333£. 6s. 8d. Apicius was worth more than 916,671£ 13s. 4d.; and, after having spent in his kitchen 833,333£ 6s. 8d. he considered the remainder too little for his support, and poisoned himself!
