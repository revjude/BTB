 $\quad$ <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Esth.6.1|1]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> On that night<small><small>[^2]</small></small> could not the king sleep<small><small>[^3]</small></small>, and he commanded to bring the book of records<small><small>[^4]</small></small> of the chronicles; and they were read before the king. <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Esth.6.2|2]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana<small><small>[^5]</small></small> and Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, the keepers of the door<small><small>[^6]</small></small>, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus. <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Esth.6.3|3]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> And the king said, What honour<small><small>[^7]</small></small> and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing<small><small>[^8]</small></small> done for him. 

$\quad$ <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Esth.6.4|4]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> And the king said, Who \[is\] in the court<small><small>[^9]</small></small>? Now Haman was come into the outward<small><small>[^10]</small></small> court of the king’s house, to speak<small><small>[^11]</small></small> unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him. <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Esth.6.5|5]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> And the king’s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in. <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[Esth.6.6|6]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king<small><small>[^12]</small></small> delighteth to honour?

[^23]: Pitts gives a similar account of the mode of honouring a person who turns a Mohammedan, at Algiers: "The apostate is to get on a stately steed, with a rich saddle and fine trappings. He is also richly habited, and has a turban on his head, but nothing of this is to be called his own; only there are given him about two or three yards of broad cloth, which is laid before him on the saddle. The horse, with him on his back, is led all round the city, which he is several hours in doing. The apostate is attended with drums and other music, and twenty or thirty serjeants. They march in order on each side of the horse, with naked swords in their hands. The crier goes before, with a loud voice giving thanks to God for the proselyte that is made."
