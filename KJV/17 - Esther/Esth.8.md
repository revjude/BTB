[^23]: The Hebrew word ***Hoddo***, in Syriac, ***Hendoo***, and in Arabic, ***Hind***, is rendered India by all the versions. India, or Hindostan, is a large country of the south of Asia, extending from north to south about 2,400 miles, and from east to west 1,800, between 8 degrees and 35 degrees n lat. and 68 degrees and 92 degrees e long.; being bounded on the west by the Indus, east by the Birman empire and Thibet, north by the Indian Caucasus, and south by the Indian Ocean. It is probable, however, that all the country east of the Indus was anciently called India.
