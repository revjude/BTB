$\quad$ <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[2Sam.13.19|19]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> [¶]And Tamar put ashes<small><small>[^31]</small></small> on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that \[was\] on her, and laid her<small><small>[^32]</small></small> hand on her head, and went on crying. <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[2Sam.13.20|20]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon<small><small>[^33]</small></small> thy brother been with thee? but hold<small><small>[^34]</small></small> now thy peace, my sister: he \[is\] thy brother; regard not<small><small>[^35]</small></small> this thing.

This will receive illustration from the account which Mr. Jackson gives of the Arabian manner of kneading and baking. "They have a small place built with clay, between two and three feet high, having a hole at the bottom for the convenience of drawing out the ashes, something similar to that of a brick-kiln. The oven is usually about fifteen inches wide at top, and gradually grows wider to the bottom. It is heated with wood; and when sufficiently hot, and perfectly clear from smoke, having nothing but clear embers at bottom, which continue to reflect great heat, they prepare the dough in a large bowl, and mould the cakes to the desired size on a board or stone placed near the oven. After they have kneaded the cake to a proper consistency, they pat it a little, then toss it about with great dexterity in one hand till it is as thin as they choose to make it. They then wet one side of it with water, at the same time wetting the hand and arm with which they put it into the oven." [[2Sam.13|2Sam 13:8]]
