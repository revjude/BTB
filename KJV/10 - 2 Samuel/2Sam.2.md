[^51]: This was spoken in allusion to the proposal of Abner ([[2Sam.2|2Sam 2:14]]), which led to the slaughter of twelve young men of each party, and thus provoked the battle. It is probable, that Joab had orders simply to act on the defensive, and would not have attacked the Israelites that day unless compelled; therefore the blame lay upon Abner and Israel.

[^55]: Bithron or Bether is probably the same as ***Betarus***, which is placed in the Antonine Itinerary between Cesarea of Palestine and Diospolis or Lydda, 18 miles from the former, and 22 from the latter. The Jerusalem Itinerary mentions a place called Bethar, 16 miles from Cesarea, and 20 from Diospolis, which is probably the same. The Talmudists say that it was four miles distant from the sea.

[^57]: The slain of Israel, though greatly exceeding those of Judah, were not great.
