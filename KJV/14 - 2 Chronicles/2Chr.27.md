***Jotham Reigns in Judah***&emsp;<small><sup>\[ [[2Kgs.15|2 Kings 15:32–38]] ]</sup></small> ^bsb1134

 $\quad$ <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[2Chr.27.1|1]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> Jotham \[was\] twenty and five<small><small>[^2]</small></small> years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also \[was\] Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.<small><small>[^3]</small></small> <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[2Chr.27.2|2]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> And he did<small><small>[^4]</small></small> \[that which was\] right in the sight of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not<small><small>[^5]</small></small> into the temple of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. And the people<small><small>[^6]</small></small> did yet corruptly. <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[2Chr.27.3|3]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> He built the high gate<small><small>[^7]</small></small> of the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and on the wall of Ophel<small><small>[^8]</small></small> he built much. <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[2Chr.27.4|4]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> Moreover he built cities<small><small>[^9]</small></small> in the mountains<small><small>[^10]</small></small> of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers<small><small>[^11]</small></small>. 

$\quad$ <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[2Chr.27.5|5]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> [¶]He fought also with the king of the Ammonites<small><small>[^12]</small></small>, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand<small><small>[^13]</small></small> measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much<small><small>[^14]</small></small> did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third. <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[2Chr.27.6|6]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> So Jotham<small><small>[^15]</small></small> became mighty, because he prepared<small><small>[^16]</small></small> his ways before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> his God.

[^11]: These castles and towers he doubtless built built for the protection of the country people against marauders.

[^12]: We find here, that he brought the Ammonites under a heavy tribute for three years; but whether this was the effect of his prevailing against them, is not so evident. Some think that they paid this tribute for three years, and then revolted; that, in consequence, he attacked them, and their utter subjection was the result.
