[^11]: It is supposed, with much probability, that the first measure means the cubit used in the time of Moses, contradistinguished from that used in Babylon, and which the Israelites used after their return from captivity. And, as these Books were written after the captivity, it was necessary for the writer to make this remark, lest it should be thought that the measurement was by the Babylonish cubit, which was a palm or one-sixth shorter than the cubit of Moses; which may serve to reconcile some variations in the historical books, with respect to numbers when applied to measures.

[^14]: As the height of the temple was only thirty cubits, 120 seems too great a height for the porch; but the Syriac, Arabic, and the LXX in the codex Alexandrinus, have only twenty, probably reading, instead of ***maiah weesrim***, "one hundred and twenty," ***ammoth esrim***, "twenty cubits;" which brings it within the proportion of the other measures.
