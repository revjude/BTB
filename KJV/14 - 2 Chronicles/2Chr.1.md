The LXX have <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>εκ</span> <span class='asgreek'>Θεκουε</span></span>, "from Tekoa," the Vulgate, ***de Coa***, "from Koa," which is adopted by Dr. Geddes; the Syriac, "from the city Aphelia;" and the Arabic, "***ex urbe Australium***." Bochart thinks it signifies a tribute; others suppose that it signifies a string or drove of horses, or as Jarchi says, what the Germans call ***Stutte***, a stud; but Houbigant supposes it to be a corruption for ***mercavah***, "chariots." Our English translation, however, which regards it as synonymous with ***tikwah***, seems by far the best. According to Norden, linen yarn is still one of the principal articles of commerce in Egypt, and is exported in very large quantities, together with unmanufactured flax and spun cotton; and Sanutus, 400 years ago, remarked that though Christian countries abounded in flax, yet the goodness of the Egyptian was such, that it was dispersed even to the west.
