[^19]: When the soldier retired from the tumults of war to the bosom of his family, he frequently hung up his arms in the temple, as a grateful acknowledgment of the protection he had received, and of the victories he had won. It is highly probable, therefore, that the arms of David which Jehoiada delivered to the captains of hundreds, "which were in the house of God," were laid up in the tabernacle by David when he resigned the command of his armies to his generals; and there is reason to believe that his conduct, in this respect, was followed by many of his companions in arms.
