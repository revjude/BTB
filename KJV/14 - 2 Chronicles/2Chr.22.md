[^22]: The account in the parallel passage is somewhat different. "The current of the story at large is this," says Dr. Lightfoot: "Jehu slayeth Joram in the field of Jezreel, as Ahaziah and Joram were together: Ahaziah seeing this, flies, and gets into Samaria, and hides himself there. Jehu marches to Jezreel, and makes Jezebel dogs' meat. From thence sends to Samaria for the heads of Ahab's children and posterity; which are brought him by night, and shewed to the people in the morning. Then he marches to Samaria, and, by the way, slayeth forty-two of Ahab's kinsmen, and findeth Jehonadab, the father of the Rechabites. Coming into Samaria, he maketh search for Ahaziah. They find him hid, bring him to Jehu, and he commands to carry him towards Gur, by Ibleam, and there to slay him. They do so. Smite him in his chariot, and his charioteer driveth away to Megiddo before he dies." "[[2Kgs.9|2Kgs 9:27]], at Megiddo, in the kingdom of Samaria."
