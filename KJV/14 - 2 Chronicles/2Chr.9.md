[^31]: This queen is called Balkis by the Arabians, who say she came from the city of Sheba, also called Mareb, in Yemen or Arabia Felix; but the Ethiopians call her Maqueda, claim her as their sovereign, and say that her posterity reigned there for a long time. Mr. Bruce has given us the history of her and her descendants from Abyssinian records; and Josephus says that Sheba was the ancient name of the city of Meroe (south of Egypt, and sometimes comprehended in Ethiopia), and that this princess came from thence. Those who think the princess came from Arabia, rely chiefly on the fact that gold, silver, spices, and precious stones, which were the presents she made to Solomon, are the natural products of that country; and that it may well be placed at the uttermost part of the earth, as it borders on the southern ocean, and formerly they knew no land beyond it.

That it was name of a place in the East Indies, seems probable from the articles brought thence, and also from the ships sent thither being built at Ezion–geber, on the Red Sea; though Michaelis supposes that the fleet coasted along the shore of Africa, doubling the Cape of Good Hope, and came to Tartessus, in Spain, and thence back again the same way; that this accounts for their three years' voyage out and home; and that Spain and the coasts of Africa furnish all the commodities which they brought back.

When Solomon had violated this law, and multiplied horses to excess ([[1Kgs.4|1Kgs 4:26]]), it was soon attended with those fatal consequences that the law foretold: for this wisest of kings having likewise, in violation of another law, married Pharaoh's daughter (the early fruits of this commerce), and then, by a repetition of the same crime, but a transgression of another law, had espoused more strange women ([[1Kgs.4|1Kgs 4:26]]; [[1Kgs.11|1Kgs 11:1]]), they first,in defiance of a fourth law, persuaded him to build them idol temples for their use; and afterwards, against a fifth law, brought him to erect other temples for his own."
