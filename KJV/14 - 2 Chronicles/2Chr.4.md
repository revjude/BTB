[^6]: In the parallel passage of Kings, instead of ***bekarim***, "oxen," we have ***pekaim***, "knops," in the form of colocynths. (See note on [[1Kgs.6|1Kgs 6:18]], and see note on [[2Kgs.4|2Kgs 4:39]]); which last is supposed by able critics to be the reading which ought to received be here; ***bekarim***, "oxen," being a mistake for ***pekaim***, "knops." Houbigant, however, contends that the words in both places are right; but that ***bakar*** does not signify an ox here, but a large kind of grape, according to its meaning in Arabic. But Dr. A. Clarke states that ***bakar***, or ***bakarat***, has no such meaning in Arabic, though the phrase ***aino*** '***lbikri***, or "ox-eye," signifies a species of black grape, very large, and of incredible sweetness; that consequently the criticism of this great man is not solid; and that the likeliest method of reconciling the two places is to suppose a change in the letters as above.

[^10]: In the parallel passage, it is said to hold only two thousand baths; which some think may be reconciled by supposing that the quantity of water which was commonly in it was 2,000 baths, but that, if filled up to the top, it would hold 3,000. But, as we have already seen that the Babylonish cubit was less than that of the ancient Hebrews, it might be the same with measures of capacity; so that 2,000 of the ancient Jewish baths might have been equal to 3,000 of those used after the captivity. The Targum cuts the knot: "It received 3,000 baths of dry measure, and held 2,000 of liquid measure." See note on [[1Kgs.7|1Kgs 7:26]]. [[1Kgs.7|1Kgs 7:26]]
