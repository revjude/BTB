A most prodigious change from the height of piety in his father's time, into the sink of impiety in this!

[^70]: Amon's conduct is recorded as like his father Manasseh, in sacrificing to graven images; by which some think it is an evidence that Manasseh did not truly repent, but they forget how many good kings had wicked sons. In one point of view Manasseh was defective, although it cannot be supposed that it affected his eternal state; for when he cast out the images, he did not utterly deface and destroy them, according to the law in [[Deut.7|Deut 7:5]], which required, moreover, that the graven images should be burnt with fire. How necessary that law was, this instance shews; for the carved images being only thrown aside, and not burnt, Amon knew where to find them, soon set them up, and sacrificed to them.
