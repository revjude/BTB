Forster says that there is now a place situated in the vicinity of Pelusium called Safnas, which may be a vestige of the ancient name. It appears to have been the very first town in Egypt, in the road from Palestine, that afforded tolerable accommodation for the fugitives. It was at this place that, according to Jerome and several of the ancients, tradition says the faithful Jeremiah was stoned to death by these rebellious wretches, for whose welfare he had watched, prayed, and suffered every kind of indignity and hardship.

[^38]: It is evident from verse 28, that some Jews were to escape the general destruction in Egypt, and to return into their own country, though but a few; and the same thing is implied in the latter clause of this verse. But the former part excludes from the number of those who should escape every individual of those who are properly termed "the remnant of Judah;" those who had willingly and rebelliously "set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to dwell there," on a presumption that they knew better than God how to consult their own restoration. The few, then, who were destined to escape, were to be such as had come into the land of Egypt with Johanan by compulsion, or had previously fled thither, or in some other less offensive manner, and chanced to be there when the storm burst upon them.

[^47]: or, frame of heaven. As the Sun was worshipped, not only under the name of ***baal shamayim*** "Lord of heaven," but also by that of ***Molech*** or King; it is likely also that the Moon was adored as ***melecheth hashshamayim*** "the Queen of heaven." So the Orphic hymn addressed to the Moon begins <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>Κλυθι</span> <span class='asgreek'>θεα</span> <span class='asgreek'>ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΑ</span></span>, "Hear, goddess Queen." And Homer, in his Hymn to the Moon, addresses her, <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>Χαιρε</span></span>, <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>ανασσα</span></span>, <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>θεα</span></span> "All hail, Queen, goddess." In Epiphanius, we find some women of Arabia, towards the end of the fourth century, had set up another queen of heaven, the Virgin Mary, too well known since under that name and character, whom they likewise worshipped as a goddess, by holding stated assemblies every year to her honour, and by offering a cake of bread in her name; whence these heretics were called Collyridians, from the Greek <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>κολλυρις</span></span>, a cake.
