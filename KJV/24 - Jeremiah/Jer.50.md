[^143]: We have already adverted to the completion of the prophecies respecting the final destruction of Babylon (on [[Isa.13|Isa 13:18]]), and shall only add a few more observations, in order to shew more clearly the full accomplishment of some of these predictions. Strabo says that in his time (about the Christian era) a great part of it was a desert. Jerome says that in his time (cir. ad 340) it was quite in ruins, the walls merely serving for an inclosure for wild beasts, for the hunting of the kings of Parthia, and modern travellers universally concur in describing it in a state of utter desolation, and the habitation of wild beasts and noxious reptiles.
