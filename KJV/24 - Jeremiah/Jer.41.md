[^2]: This was the month ***Tisri*** answering to the new moon of September, the seventh of the sacred, but the first of the civil year; on the third day of which the Jews keep a fast, in commemoration of the death of Gedaliah, to which the prophet Zechariah refers, [[Zech.8|Zech 8:19]]; [[Jer.39|Jer 39:2]], [[Jer.52|Jer 52:6]].

The same mode of keeping corn prevails in Syria and the Holy Land.
