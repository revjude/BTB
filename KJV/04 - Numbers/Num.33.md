[^11]: This appears to have been the capital of the land of Goshen, and the rendezvous of the Israelites. It is placed by Jerome in the extremity of Egypt, in the Arsenoitic nome.

[^12]: [[Exod.13|Exod 13:20]]

[^13]: Supposed to be the Suche mentioned by Pliny and the Scenas Mandrorum, in the Antonine Itinerary. The Editor of Calmet places it at Birket el Hadji, or "the Pilgrims' pool," a few miles east of Cairo.

[^14]: This was evidently situated towards the north point of the Red sea. Calmet supposes it to be the same as Buthus or Butham, mentioned by Herodotus, who places it in Arabia, on the frontiers of Egypt.

[^15]: [[Num.33|Num 33:8]]; [[Exod.14|Exod 14:2]], [[Exod.14|Exod 14:9]]

[^16]: Calmet supposes this to be the Clysma of the Greeks, and the Kolzum of the Arabians. His learned Editor thinks the true situation of Baal–zephon was some miles more northerly than the present Suez.

[^27]: Rithmah was a place in the wilderness of Paran, near Kadesh Barnea; probably so called from the great number of juniper trees, as the name signifies, growing in that district.

[^28]: Probably the same as Rimmon, a city of Judah and Simeon, [[Josh.15|Josh 15:32]], [[Josh.19|Josh 19:7]]. [[Num.33|Num 33:19]]

[^29]: [[Deut.1|Deut 1:1]], Laban

[^30]: This is supposed, apparently with good reason, by the Editor of Calmet, to be the same with the present El Arish, a village three quarters of a league from the Mediterranean, and the last stage in Syria, on the road to Egypt.

[^31]: The Editor of Calmet, who supposes the Israelites to be now in the regular track from Gaza to Egypt, is of opinion that mount Shapher is the ancient name of mount Cassius, Catjeh, or Catie, a huge mole of sand, almost surrounded by the Mediterranean, on which was built a temple to Jupiter Cassius. Thevenot states, that at the village of Catie there is a well of water unpleasant for drinking; but two miles off, another whose water is good after standing a little. [[Num.33|Num 33:24]]

[^32]: This is supposed by Mr. C. Taylor, to be Ain el Mousa (probably a corruption of Moseroth) or fountains of Moses, at the head of the western gulf of the Red sea, about seven or eight miles east from Suez, seven or eight days' journey from Gaza, and five or six from Sinai. [[Deut.10|Deut 10:5]], Mosera

[^33]: [[Gen.36|Gen 36:27]]; [[Deut.10|Deut 10:6]]; [[1Chr.1|1Chr 1:43]]

[^34]: Hor–hagidgad, [[Deut.10|Deut 10:7]], Gudgodah

[^35]: Mr. Taylor, who imagines the Israelites to be now in the track of the Mecca pilgrims, supposes Jotbathah, which is described as "a land of brooks of water," to be Callah Nahar, a torrent, said to be good water by Dr. Shaw. [[Deut.10|Deut 10:7]], Jotbath

[^36]: Probably at Abiah Ailana, or Sat el Acaba, stations nearer Accaba. [[Num.33|Num 33:34]]

[^37]: ***Ezion–geber*** Dr. Shaw places this port on the western shore of the Elanitic gulf of the Red Sea. He says it is now called Meenah el Dsahab, or the golden port, by the Arabs; because it was from this place that Solomon sent his ships to Ophir. He supposes it to be about sixty miles from Sinai; and it is probable that it was near the present Accaba, i.e., the end (of the sea).

[^47]: [[Jer.48|Jer 48:22]], Beth–diblathaim, [[Ezek.6|Ezek 6:14]], Diblath

[^48]: These mountains were a ridge of rugged hills east of Jordan, and north and west of the Arnon. Nebo, Pisgah, and Peor, were but different names of the hills of which they were composed. Eusebius and Jerome inform us, that some part of them, as one went up to Heshbon, retained the old name of Abarim in their time; and that the part called Nebo was opposite Jericho, not far from the Jordan, six miles west from Heshbon, and seven east from Livias. Dr. Shaw describes them as "an exceeding high ridge of desolate mountains, no otherwise diversified than by a succession of naked rocks and precipices; rendered in some places the more frightful by a multiplicity of torrents, which fall on each side of them. This ridge is continued all along the eastern coast of the Dead sea." Mount Nebo is now called Djebel Attarous; and is described as a barren mountain, the highest point in the neighbourhood, with an uneven plain on the top. Burckhardt, Travels, pp. 369, 370.

[^50]: Probably the place called Bethsimath by Eusebius, east of Jordan, and about ten miles south of Jericho. [[Josh.13|Josh 13:20]]; [[Ezek.25|Ezek 25:9]]

[^51]: or, the plains of Shittim, This place, according to Josephus (Ant. 1. v. c. 1, § 1. Bell. 1. iv. c. 7 sec. 6), who calls it Abila, was 60 furlongs east of Jordan. [[Num.25|Num 25:1-9]]; [[Exod.25|Exod 25:5]], [[Exod.25|Exod 25:10]], [[Exod.25|Exod 25:23]]; [[Josh.2|Josh 2:1]]
