[^3]: The plague having swept away the last of that devoted generation, which provoked the Lord to "swear in his wrath that they should not enter" Canaan; he now, after an interval of 38 years, commands another census of the Israelites to be made, to preserve the distinction of families, and to regulate the tribes previous to their entry into the promised land, as well as to ascertain the proportion of land which should be allotted to each tribe. For, though the whole was divided by lot, yet the portions were so disposed, that a numerous tribe did not draw where the lots assigned small inheritances, or the contrary.

[^62]: This division by lot seems to have respect only to the quarter, or situation, which each tribe was to possess, and not to the quantity or extent of land, which was to be proportioned to the numbers of each tribe, according to the register now formed. Thus, for instance, it was determined by lot which of the twelve tribes was to inherit in the south, which in the north, etc.. Then, in that quarter where the lot fell, a larger or smaller portion of land was assigned them, according to the goodness of the soil, and in proportion as they were more or less numerous. Thus the decreasing of any tribe in the wilderness, proved the decrease of their future political importance and affluence in all succeeding ages. This equal division of property was, under God, the great bulwark and strength of the Hebrew commonwealth. According to the most exact calculations, Canaan contained 14,976,000 acres; which, divided among 600,000 men, will allow of more than 21 acres and a half to each, with a remainder of 1,976,000 acres for the princes of tribes, Levitical cities, etc., so that there was an ample provision to enable each person, with all the advantages of that fertile country and fine climate, to live, if not in affluent, yet in very comfortable circumstances. Canaan lies between lat. 31 degrees and 33 degrees 30 minutes n, and long. 35 degrees and 37 degrees e; its length, from the city of Dan to Beer–sheba, is about 200 miles; and its breadth, from the shores of the Mediterranean to the eastern borders, about 90. The Canaanites, the descendants of Canaan, son of Ham, and the original inhabitants of the land, were divided into seven principal nations - the Amorites, Hittites, Jebusites, Girgashites, Canaanites, Perizzites, and Hivites, and formed themselves into almost as many kingdoms as they had cities. After their defeat by the Israelites, such as escaped the sword became tributary; but in process of time, having seduced them to their idolatries, they recovered many of the strongest places in the country; and even formed themselves into a mighty kingdom in Galilee. They were, however, again defeated by Barak, but were not finally subdued till the reign of David and Solomon; the latter of whom employed 153,600 in the most servile parts of the work of building the temple, palace, etc.
