[^1]:  [[Num.27|Num 27:1]], The daughters of Zelophehad sue for an inheritance; [[Num.27|Num 27:6]], The law of inheritances; [[Num.27|Num 27:12]], Moses, being told of his death, sues for a successor; [[Num.27|Num 27:18]], Joshua is appointed to succeed him.

[^2]: In the orders for the division of the land, just given, no provision had been made for females, in case of failure of male issue. The five daughters of Zelophehad, therefore, considered themselves as destitute, having neither father nor brother, and being themselves entirely overlooked; and they agreed to refer the case to Moses and the rulers, whether it were not equitable that they should inherit their father's portion. This led to the enactment of an additional law to the civil code of Israel, which satisfactorily ascertained and amply secured the right of succession in cases of inheritance. This law, which is as reasonable as it is just, stands thus -

[^4]: 1. On the demise of the father, the estate descends to the sons.

[^5]:  2. If there be no son, the daughters succeed.

[^6]:  3. If there be no daughter, the brothers of the deceased inherit.

[^7]:  4. If there be no brethren, or paternal uncles, the estate goes to the grand uncles, or brothers of his father.

[^8]:  5. If there be no grand uncles, then the nearest of kin succeeds to the inheritance.

[^9]:  Beyond this fifth degree the law does not extend, because there must always have been some among the Israelites who could be called kinsmen.

[^14]: Rosenmuller translates this verse as follows: "Our father died in the wilderness, leaving no sons; nor was he among those who rebelled against the Lord with Korah, who died on account of his own sin." Professor Dathe, however, understands by "his own sin," that sin which was common to all the Israelites, who died on account of their unbelief.

[^30]: ***the Lord*** ***Yehowah elohey haroochoth lechol basar***, "Jehovah, the God of the spirits of all flesh." This address sufficiently proves, that this holy man believed man to be compounded of flesh and spirit, and that these principles are perfectly distinct. Either the materiality of the soul is a human fable, or, if it be a true doctrine, Moses did not pray under the influence of the Divine Spirit. There is a similar form of expression in [[Num.16|Num 16:22]] : "O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh;" and in [[Job.12|Job 12:10]], "In whose hand is the soul (***nephesh***) of all living; and the spirit (***rooach***) of all flesh of man." These seem decisive proofs, among many others, that the Old Testament teaches that there is an immortal spirit in man; for though ***rooach*** sometimes denotes breath or wind, yet it certainly has not that signification here, nor in the other passages cited.
