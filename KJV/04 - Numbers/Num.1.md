[^1]:  The book of Numbers is a book containing a series of the most astonishing providences and events. Every where and in every circumstance God appears; and yet there is no circumstance or occasion which does not justify those signal displays of his grace and mercy; and in every relation we perceive the consistency of the divine intentions, and the propriety of those laws which he established.

The Septuagint and Syriac have ***Reuel***, in this chapter; and in [[Num.2|Num 2:14]], the Samaritan, Vulgate, and Arabic have ***Deuel***, instead of ***Reuel***, with which reading a vast number of manuscripts concur, and which is also supported by [[Num.7|Num 7:42]], [[Num.10|Num 10:20]].

[^35]: That a comparative view may be easily taken of the state of the tribes, we will here produce them, compared with that of the second census ([[Num.26|Num 26:1]]), in their decreasing proportion, beginning with the greatest and proceeding to the least. Thus we find Judah the most populous tribe, and Manasseh the least so; the difference between them being as great as 42,000. Jacob had given Judah the pre-eminence in his prophetic blessing; and that tribe was to have the precedency in the encampments of Israel. Accordingly God had increased them more than any of their brethren. Ephraim and Manasseh, according to the same prophecy, were numbered as distinct tribes, Ephraim having the superiority, as it was foretold; and Joseph indeed appears "a fruitful bough."
