[^1]:  [[Num.5|Num 5:1]], The unclean are removed out of camp; [[Num.5|Num 5:5]], Restitution is to be made in trespass; [[Num.5|Num 5:11]], The trial of jealousy.

[^2]: The camp of Israel being now formed, with the sanctuary of God in the centre, orders were given that the lepers and unclean persons should be excluded from the camp, according to the laws given at different times on these subjects. (See the marginal references.) This expulsion was founded:

[^5]: 1. On a purely physical reason; for the diseases were contagious, and therefore there was a necessity of putting those afflicted with them apart, that the infection might not be communicated.

[^6]:  2. There was also a spiritual reason. The camp was the habitation of God; and therefore, in honour of Him who had thus condescended to dwell with them, nothing impure should be permitted to remain.

[^7]:  3. Further, there was a typical reason; for the camp was the emblem of the church, where nothing that is defiled should enter, and in which nothing that is unholy should be tolerated. [[Num.12|Num 12:14]]; [[Lev.13|Lev 13:46]]; [[Deut.24|Deut 24:8-9]]; [[2Kgs.7|2Kgs 7:3]]

[^12]: This expression does not merely refer to the actual criminality of the person, but to his consciousness of guilt respecting it. For this case must be distinguished from that of a person detected in dishonesty, which he attempted to conceal.

[^24]: This coarse offering, without oil or frankincense, implied the baseness of the crime of which the woman was suspected, and the mournful state of her family.

[^26]: or, rather, "bring it near;" i. e. her offering

[^27]: Rather, "set it," i.e., the offering; for the woman is afterwards ordered to be set before the Lord ([[Num.5|Num 5:18]]). [[Lev.1|Lev 1:3]]; [[Jer.17|Jer 17:10]]; [[Heb.13|Heb 13:4]]; [[Rev.2|Rev 2:22-23]]

[^28]: That is, water from the laver; called holy, because separated from common to sacred uses. This is the most ancient account of the trial by ordeal, which obtained so generally among various nations; and it was calculated to fortify the minds of the Israelitish women in the hour of temptation, and to render them watchful against all occasions of exciting suspicion in the breasts of their husbands.
