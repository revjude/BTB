[^5]: The lake Asphaltites, Dead sea, or Salt sea, is, according to the most authentic accounts, about 70 miles in length, and 18 in breadth. Viewing this sea from the spot where the Jordan discharges its waters into it, it takes a south-easterly direction, visible for ten or fifteen miles, when it disappears in a curve towards the east. Its surface is generally unruffled, from the hollow of the basin in which it lies scarcely admitting the free passage necessary for a strong breeze. It is, however, for the same reason, subject to whirlwinds or squalls of short duration. The mountains on each side are apparently separated by a distance of eight miles; but the expanse of water at this point has been supposed not to exceed five or six. As it advances towards the south, it evidently increases in breadth. The acrid saltness of its waters is much greater than that of the sea; and of such specific gravity that bodies will float on it that would sink in common sea-water. It is probably on this account that few fish can live in it; though the monks of St. Saba affirmed to Dr. Shaw, that they had seen fish caught in it.

[^23]: These two tribes inherited the dominions of Sihon and Og, the two vanquished kings of the Amorites, which extended from the Arnon to Mount Hermon. Of those counties, Moses gave to the tribe of Reuben the south-west part, which was bounded on the south by the river Arnon, on the west by Jordan, and on the north and east by the tribe of Gad. The tribe of Gad was bounded by the river Jordan and tribe of Reuben on the west, by the half tribe of Manasseh on the north, by the kingdom of the Amorites and Arabia Deserta on the East, and by the tribe of Reuben on the south. The part belonging to the tribe of Manasseh was bounded by the tribe of Gad on the south, by the sea of Galilee and part of Jordan on the west, by Hermon and Lebanon on the north, and by the mountains of Trachonitis on the east.

[^24]: [[Num.32|Num 32:32]]

[^25]: It is worthy of remark, that Moses does not follow any order hitherto used in arranging the tribes, but places them exactly in the order in which they possessed the land, and according to their fraternal relationship. Judah is first, having the first lot, in the South ([[Josh.15|Josh 15:1]]); and next to him is Simeon, because his inheritance was "within the inheritance of the children of Judah" ([[Josh.19|Josh 19:1]]). Benjamin, the third, had his portion between "Judah and the children of Joseph" ([[Josh.18|Josh 18:11]]). Dan was the fourth, and his lot was westward of Benjamin ([[Josh.19|Josh 19:40-41]]). Manasseh and his brother Ephraim had their inheritances behind that of Benjamin ([[Josh.16|Josh 16:7]]). Next these dwelt Zebulun and Issachar ([[Josh.19|Josh 19:10-17]]); and then Asher and Naphtali ([[Josh.19|Josh 19:24-32]]).
