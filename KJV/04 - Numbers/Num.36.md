[^1]:  [[Num.36|Num 36:1]], The inconvenience of the inheritance of daughters is remedied by marrying in their own tribes, [[Num.36|Num 36:7]], lest the inheritance should be removed from the tribe; [[Num.36|Num 36:10]], The daughters of Zelophehad marry their father’s brothers’ sons.

[^4]: ***The Lord commanded*** To one division of the tribe of Manasseh, a portion had been assigned eastward of Jordan; but Zelophehad was of that division, to which an inheritance was afterwards allotted west of Jordan; yet, expecting the promised land, the elders of the Manassites now propose a difficulty, upon the adjudged case of Zelophehad's daughters ( [[Num.27|Num 27:1-11]]). If the females should inherit, in defect of male issue, and should intermarry with other tribes they would diminish the interest, and weaken the influence of their own tribes, and give occasion to future confusion, and perhaps contention. The Manassites therefore referred the case to Moses; and he, by the authority of God, annexed a clause, which would effectually keep the tribes and inheritances distinct, as long as it was observed. Heiresses were not allowed to marry out of their own tribe, though within those bounds they might consult their own inclinations.
