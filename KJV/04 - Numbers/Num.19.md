[^1]:  [[Num.19|Num 19:1]], The water of separation made of the ashes of a red heifer; [[Num.19|Num 19:11]], The law for the use of it in purification of the unclean.

[^2]: [[Num.31|Num 31:21]]; [[Heb.9|Heb 9:10]]

[^3]: The following curious particulars have been remarked in this ordinance:

[^4]: [[Exod.12|Exod 12:5]]; [[Lev.22|Lev 22:20-25]]; [[Mal.1|Mal 1:13-14]]; [[Luke.1|Luke 1:35]]; [[Heb.7|Heb 7:26]]; [[1Pet.1|1Pet 1:19]]; [[1Pet.2|1Pet 2:22]]

[^6]: 1. A heifer was appointed for sacrifice, in opposition to the Egyptian superstition, which held these sacred, and worshipped their goddess Isis under this form; and this appears the more likely, because males only were chosen for sacrifice. So Herodotus says, they sacrifice males, both old and young; but it is not lawful for them to offer females.

[^7]:  2. It was to be a red heifer, because the Egyptians sacrificed red bulls to the evil demon Typhon.

[^8]:  3. It was to be without spot, having no mixture of any other colour. Plutarch says, the Egyptians "sacrifice red bulls, and select them with such scrupulous attention, that if the animal has a single black or white hair, they reckon it <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>αθυτον</span></span>, unfit to be sacrificed."

[^9]:  4. Without blemish. (See note on [[Lev.22|Lev 22:21]].)

[^10]:  5. On which never came yoke. Because an animal which had been used for a common purpose was deemed improper for sacrifice. [[Num.19|Num 19:6]]; [[Lev.14|Lev 14:6]]; [[Isa.1|Isa 1:18]]; [[Rev.1|Rev 1:5]]

[^18]: That is, water prepared by being mixed with the ashes of the heifer, and set apart for the special purpose of being sprinkled on those who had contracted any legal defilement. To this rite the apostle Paul, in his epistle to the Hebrews. ([[Heb.9|Heb 9:13-14]]), pointedly alludes: "For if," says he, "the blood of bulls and of goats," alluding, probably, to the sin-offerings and the scape-goat, "and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh; how much more shall the blood of Christ, who, through the eternal Spirit, offered himself without spot unto God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God."

[^21]: He who touched a dead beast was only unclean for one day ([[Lev.11|Lev 11:12]], [[Lev.11|Lev 11:27]], [[Lev.11|Lev 11:39]]); but he who touches a dead man is unclean for seven days. This was certainly designed to shew the peculiar impurity and sinfulness of man, and the hatefulness of sin, seven times worse than the vilest animal!

[^22]: Heb. soul of man

[^23]: ***Yithchatta***, literally, "he shall sin himself," i.e., not add sin, but take it away, purify.
