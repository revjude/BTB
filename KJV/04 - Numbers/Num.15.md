Hence it is evident, that God delivered to the patriarchs an epitome of that law which was afterwards given in detail to Moses, the essence of which consisted in its sacrifices; and these sacrifices were of clean animals, the most perfect, useful, and healthy of all that are brought under the immediate government of man. Gross feeding and ferocious animals were all excluded, as well as all birds of prey.

[^29]: This law concerning sins of ignorance, being entirely diverse from one before considered, occasions considerable difficulty ([[Lev.4|Lev 4:1-35]]). Some explain that law as relating to sins of commission, this to sins of omission. Others explain the one of inadvertent violations of the moral law, and the other of the transgressions of the ceremonial law, and some think that related to the whole nation, this to any one tribe; or that to the bulk of the nation, this to the rulers and elders. The Jews say, that the former law referred to such national transgressions through heedlessness, as consisted with the maintenance of the prescribed worship in the main; but that this especially respected the case of the nation, when through inattention, and the example and authority of wicked rulers, they had turned aside and committed idolatry, or conducted their worship directly contrary to law; yet through a culpable ignorance, and not in presumption. This was evidently the case under several of their kings; and the explanation seems well grounded.

Such conduct "reproacheth the Lord," as if his commands were needless, unreasonable, and inimical to the happiness of man; his favour were not desirable, or his wrath not to be feared. In short, as if it were more advantageous to rebel against him than to serve him. Such acts admitted of no atonement. The person was condemned to bear his own iniquity, and to be cut off.
