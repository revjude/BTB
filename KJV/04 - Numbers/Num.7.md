[^12]: The Gershonites being fewest in number of able men, had the less burdensome things to carry; for they carried only the curtains, coverings, and hangings ([[Num.4|Num 4:25]], [[Num.4|Num 4:40]]). And although this was a cumbersome carriage, and they needed waggons, yet it was not a heavy one, and they needed few.

[^29]: It is worthy of remark, that the different tribes are represented here as bringing their offerings precisely in the same order in which they encamped about the tabernacle (see [[Num.2|Num 2:1]] and [[Num.10|Num 10:1]]), beginning at the East, then proceeding to the South, then to the West, and ending with the North, according to the course of the sun. Thus God evinces that he "is not the author of confusion, but of peace" ([[1Cor.14|1Cor 14:33]]). It is also worthy of remark, that every tribe offers the same kind of offering, and in the same quantity, to shew, that as every tribe was equally indebted to God for its support, so each should testify an equal sense of obligation. Besides, the vessels were all sacrificial vessels, and the animals were all clean animals, such as were proper for sacrifices; and therefore everything was intended to point out, that the people were to be a holy people, fully dedicated to God, and that God was to dwell among them. Thus, as the priests, altar, etc. were anointed, and the tabernacle dedicated, so the people, by this offering, became consecrated to God. Therefore every act here was a religious act.

[^38]: ***Kaârah***, in Arabic, ***kâran***, from ***kuâra***, to be deep, a large deep dish or bowl. It appears by the metal of which this charger and bowl were made, that they were for the use of the altar of burnt offerings in the outer court; for all the vessels of the sanctuary were of gold. It was probably used for receiving the flesh of the sacrifices upon which the priests feasted, or the fine flour for the meat offerings.

[^39]: ***Mizrak***, from ***zarak***, to sprinkle, a bowl or bason, used in sprinkling the blood of the sacrifice ([[Exod.27|Exod 27:21]]).

[^40]: ***Kaph***, in Syriac, ***kaphtho***, a pan or censer, on which the incense was put. Both the metal of which it was made, and that which it contained, shew that it was for the use of the golden altar in the sanctuary.

[^42]: These sacrifices were more numerous than the burnt offering or the sin offering; because the priests, the princes, and as many of the people as they invited, had a share of them, and feasted, with great rejoicing, before the Lord. This custom, as Mr. Shelden observes, seems to have been imitated by the heathen, who dedicated their altars, temples, statues, etc., with much ceremony.

[^50]: Both Jewish and Christian writers have been surprised that this work of offering went forward on the seventh day (which they suppose to have been a sabbath), as well as on the other days. But:

[^51]: [[Num.1|Num 1:10]], [[Num.2|Num 2:18]]

[^52]: 1. There is no absolute proof that this seventh day of offering was a sabbath.

[^53]:  2. Were it even so, could the people be better employed than in thus consecrating themselves and their services to the Lord?

[^54]:  We have already seen that every act was a religious act; and we may rest assured, that no day was too holy for the performance of such acts as are here recorded. Here it may be observed, that Moses has thought fit to set down distinctly, and at full length, the offerings of the princes of each tribe, though, as we have already observed, they were the very same, both in quantity and quality, that an honourable mention might be made of every one apart, and that none might think himself in the least neglected.

[^55]: [[Num.7|Num 7:13-89]]

[^56]: Whether there were any prayers made for the gracious acceptance of the sacrifices which should be hereafter offered on the altar, we are not informed; but the sacrifices themselves were of the nature of supplications, and it is probable, that they who offered them, made humble petitions along with them.

[^62]: When the twelve days of the dedication commenced cannot be easily determined; but the computation of F. Scacchus seems highly probable. He supposes, that the tabernacle being erected the first day of the first month of the second year after the departure from Egypt, seven days were spent in the consecration of it, and the altar, etc.; and that on the eight day, Moses began to consecrate Aaron and his sons, which lasted seven days more. Then, on the fourteenth day of that month, was the feast day of unleavened bread; which God commanded to be observed in the first month ([[Num.9|Num 9:1]]), and which lasted till the 22nd. The rest of the month, we may well suppose, was spent in giving, receiving, and delivering the laws contained in the book of Leviticus; after which, on the first day of the second month, Moses began to number the people, according to the command in the beginning of this book; which may be supposed to have lasted three days. On the fourth, the Levites were numbered; on the next day we may suppose they were offered to God, and given to the Priests; and on the sixth, they were expiated and consecrated, as we read in the following chapter. On the seventh day, their several charges were assigned them ([[Num.4|Num 4:1]]); after which, he supposes the princes began to offer, on the eight day of the second month, for the dedication of the altar, which lasted till the nineteenth day inclusively; and on the twentieth day of this month, they removed from Sinai to the wilderness of Paran ([[Num.10|Num 10:11-12]]).

[^64]: [[Num.7|Num 7:13-89]]

[^65]: Dr. Adam Clarke remarks, that the Hebrew form of expression here, and in [[Num.7|Num 7:78]], has something curious in it; ***beyom âshtey âsar yom***, "in the day, the first and tenth day;" ***beyom shenim âsar yom***, "in the day, two and tenth day." But this is the idiom of the language; and to an original Hebrew, our almost anomalous words eleventh and twelfth, would appear as strange.

[^67]: [[Num.7|Num 7:13-89]]; The oblations and sacrifices enumerated in [[Num.7|Num 7:13-88]] were simple and plain, though costly and magnificent. On this occasion we find there were offered 12 silver chargers, each weighing 130 shekels; 12 silver bowls, each 70 shekels; 12 golden spoons, each 10 shekels; making the total amount of silver vessels 2,400 shekels, and that of golden vessels, 120 shekels. A silver charger, at 130 shekels, reduced to troy weight, makes 75 oz. 9 dwts. 16, 8/31 gr.; and a silver bowl, at 70 shekels, amounts to 40 oz. 12 dwts. 21, 21/31 gr. The total weight of the 12 chargers is therefore 905 oz. 16 dwts. 3, 3/31 gr.; and that of the 12 bowls, 487 oz. 14 dwts. 20; 4/31 gr.; making the total weight of silver vessels 1,393 oz. 10 dwts. 23, 7/31 gr. The golden spoons, allowing each to be 5 oz. 16 dwts. 3, 3/31 gr., amount to 69 oz. 3 dwts. 13, 5/31 gr. Besides these, there were for sacrifice -parBullocks, 12

[^74]: By this we may at once see, that though the place in which they now sojourned was a wilderness as to cities, villages, and regular inhabitants, yet there was plenty of pasturage; else the Israelites could not have furnished these cattle, with all the sacrifices necessary for different occasions, and especially for the passover, which must of itself have required an immense number of lambs, when each family of 600,000 males was obliged to provide one ([[Num.9|Num 9:1]]).
