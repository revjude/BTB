[^2]: When this was spoken, says Bp. Patrick, is not certain. If Moses went into the tabernacle immediately after the princes had offered ([[Num.7|Num 7:89]]), it may be thought he then spake these things unto him; but both this and what follows, concerning the Levites, seem rather to have been delivered after the order for giving them to the priests, and appointing their several charges ([[Num.3|Num 3:1]] and [[Num.4|Num 4:1]]). But some other things intervening, which depended upon what had been ordered respecting their camp, and that of the Israelites, Moses omits this until he had stated them, and some other matters which he had received from God.

[^24]: ***Wehainaphta othom tenoophath***, literally, as in [[Num.8|Num 8:11]], "and thou shalt wave them for a wave-offering;" manifestly in allusion to the ancient sacrificial rite of waving the sacrifices before the Lord; and it is probable, that some significant action, analogous to the waving of the sacrifice, was employed on this occasion; for the Levites were considered as an offering to the Lord, to whose service they were wholly dedicated. To this the apostle Paul manifestly alludes, when, in writing to the Romans, he says ([[Rom.12|Rom 12:1]]), "I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service."

[^41]: ***as the Lord*** [[Num.8|Num 8:5-26]]

[^42]: In [[Num.4|Num 4:3]], the Levites are appointed to the service of the tabernacle at the age of 30 years; and in [[1Chr.23|1Chr 23:24]], they are ordered to commence their work at 20 years of age. In order to reconcile this apparent discrepancy, it is to be observed:

[^43]: Heb. war the warfare of, etc. [[1Cor.9|1Cor 9:7]]; [[2Cor.10|2Cor 10:4]]; [[1Tim.1|1Tim 1:18]], [[1Tim.6|1Tim 6:12]]; [[2Tim.2|2Tim 2:3-5]]

[^44]: 1. At the time of which Moses speaks in [[Num.4|Num 4:3]], the Levitical service was exceedingly severe, and consequently required full grown, robust men, to perform it; the age of 30 was therefore appointed as the period for commencing this service, the weightier part of which was probably there intended.

[^45]:  2. In this place God seems to speak of the service in a general way. Hence the age of 25 is fixed.

[^46]:  3. In David's time, and afterwards, in the fixed tabernacle and temple, the laboriousness of the service no longer existed, and hence 20 years was the age appointed. [[Num.4|Num 4:3]], [[Num.4|Num 4:23]]; [[1Chr.23|1Chr 23:3]], [[1Chr.23|1Chr 23:24-27]], [[1Chr.28|1Chr 28:12-13]]

[^47]: Heb. return from the warfare of the service, [[Num.4|Num 4:23]]; [[2Tim.4|2Tim 4:7]]; The Levites, above fifty years of age, might superintend and assist their junior brethren in the ordinary offices, and give them and the people counsel and instruction; but they were exempted from carrying the tabernacle and from other laborious services. It is remarkable, that no law was made concerning the age at which the priests should begin to officiate, and though various blemishes disqualified them for the service of the sanctuary, yet they continued their ministrations till death, if capable. On the other hand, nothing is said concerning any bodily defects or blemishes disqualifying the Levites; but the time of their service is expressly settled. Their work was far more laborious than that of the priests; it is therefore likely that the priests would not begin very early to officiate; and the wisdom and experience of age would increase, rather than diminish, their fitness for the sacred duties of their office.
