[^49]: Heb. mouth, The Levites were under the command of the priests. Eleazar exercised this authority in general, as next in succession to Aaron, and he in particular was placed over the Kohathites; while Ithamar, his younger brother, commanded the Gershonites and Merarites ([[Num.4|Num 4:33]]).

[^60]: In the third chapter we have an account of the whole number of the Levites; and here of those only who were able to serve the Lord in the sanctuary. By comparing the two places, we find the number of the effective and ineffective males. Thus we find that the whole number of the Levites amounted to 22,300; of whom 8,580 were fit for service and 13,720 unfit, being either too old or too young. What an astonishing number of men, all performing some service by which God was glorified, and the congregation at large benefited!

[^63]: The family of Merari, though smaller than either of the other families of Levi, yet had a greater number of able men than any of them; for out of 6,200 males of a month old and upwards, we find 3,200 who were neither too young nor too old for the service of the sanctuary; which was more than one-half of their whole number. In this the wisdom and providence of God appear most conspicuously; for the Merarites were charged with the heaviest part of the sanctuary, as the boards, bars, sockets, etc; and though waggons were afterwards provided for them, yet the loading and unloading of the sockets, and other things of great weight, would require much strength, both bodily and numerical. (Compare [[Num.4|Num 4:36]] and [[Num.4|Num 4:40]], with [[Num.3|Num 3:22]], [[Num.3|Num 3:28]], [[Num.3|Num 3:24]].) Thus God ever manifests his wisdom, in fitting men for the work to which they are appointed, whether with respect to number or gifts: "For to one is given, by the Spirit, the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge, by the same Spirit; to another faith, by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing, by the same Spirit; to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues, but all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will."
