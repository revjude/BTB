[^10]: Dr. Kennicott justly remarks, that "the description now given of Balaam's residence, instead of being particular, agrees with any place, in any country where there is a river; for he lived by 'Pethor, which is by the river of the land of his people.' But was Pethor, then, near the Nile in Egypt? Or in Canaan, near Jordan? Or in Mesopotamia, near the Euphrates, and belonging to the Ammonites? This last was in fact the case; and therefore, it is well that twelve Hebrew manuscripts (with two of De Rossi's) confirm the Samaritan text here, in reading instead of ***âmmo***, 'his people,' Ammon, with the Syriac and Vulgate versions." Houbigant justly contends for this reading; and necessity urges the propriety of adopting it, and it thus agrees with [[Deut.23|Deut 23:4]]. Ptolemy calls Pethor, Pachura, and Eusebius, Pathura; who places it in upper Mesopotamia. Calmet is of opinion, that it was situated towards Thapsacus, beyond the Euphrates.

[^31]: An erroneous opinion prevailed, both in those days and in after ages, that some men had the power, by the help of their gods, to devote, not only particular persons, but cities and whole armies, to destruction. This they are said to have done sometimes by words of imprecation; of which there was a set form among some people, which <span class='asgreek'>Ζ</span>schines calls <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>διοριζομενην</span> <span class='asgreek'>αραν</span></span> , "the determinate curse." Macrobius has a whole chapter on this subject. He gives us two of the ancient forms used in reference to the destruction of Carthage; the first, which was only pronounced by the dictator, or general, was to call over the protecting deities to their side, and the other to devote the city to destruction, which they were supposed to have abandoned. The Romans held, that no city would be taken till its tutelary god had forsaken it; or if it could be taken, it would be unlawful, as it would be sacrilege to lead the gods into captivity. Virgil intimates, that Troy was destroyed because ***Excessere omnes adytis, arisque relictis dii, quibus imperium hoc steterat***, "All the gods, by whose assistance the empire had hitherto been preserved, forsook their altars and temples." See more on this subject in Dr. A. Clarke, Bp. Patrick, and Burder's Oriental Customs, No. 734.

It is to no purpose to speak of the construction of the ass's mouth, of the formation of the tongue and jaws being unfit for speaking; for an adequate cause is assigned for this wonderful effect, "The Lord opened the mouth of the ass"; and no one who believes in a God, can doubt of his power to do this and much more.
