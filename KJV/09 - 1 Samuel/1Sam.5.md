[^4]: Ashdod, called Azotus by the Greeks, was one of the five satrapies of the Philistines, and a place of great strength and consequence. It was situated near the Mediterranean, between Askelon and Jamnia, thirty-four miles north of Gaza, according to Diodorus Siculus, and the Antonine and Jerusalem Itineraries. It is now called Shdood; and Dr. Richardson says they neither saw nor heard of any ruins there. "The ground," he observes, "around Ashdod is beautifully undulating, but not half stocked with cattle. The site of the town is on the summit of a grassy hill; and, if we are to believe historians, was anciently as strong as it was beautiful." [[Josh.11|Josh 11:22]]; [[Acts.8|Acts 8:40]], Azotus

[^9]: The name of this idol, Dagon, signifies a fish, and it is supposed to be the Atergatis of the Syrians, corruptly called Derceto by the Greeks, which had the upper part like a woman, and the lower part like a fish; as Lucian informs us:

[^10]: or, the fishy part

"In Phoenicia I saw the image of Derceto; a strange sight truly! For she had the half of a woman, but from the thighs downward a fish's tail."

[^12]:  Diodorus (1. ii.) describing the same idol, as represented at Askelon, says, <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>το</span> <span class='asgreek'>μεν</span> <span class='asgreek'>προσωπον</span> <span class='asgreek'>εχει</span> <span class='asgreek'>γυναικος</span></span>, <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>το</span> <span class='asgreek'>δἀλλο</span> <span class='asgreek'>σωμα</span> <span class='asgreek'>παν</span> <span class='asgreek'>ιχθυος</span></span>. "It had the head of a woman, but all the rest of the body a fish's."

[^13]:  Probably Horace alludes to this idol, in De Art. Poet. 4; ***Desinat in piscem, mulier formosa superne***." "The upper part a handsome woman, and the lower part a fish." If such was the form of this idol, then everything that was human was broken off from what resembled a fish.
