[^1]:  [[1Sam.23|1Sam 23:1]], David, enquiring of the Lord by Abiathar, rescues Keilah; [[1Sam.23|1Sam 23:7]], God shewing him the coming of Saul, and the treachery of the Keilites, he escapes from Keilah; [[1Sam.23|1Sam 23:14]], In Ziph Jonathan comes and comforts him; [[1Sam.23|1Sam 23:19]], The Ziphites discover him to Saul; [[1Sam.23|1Sam 23:25]], At Maon he is rescued from Saul by the invasion of the Philistines; [[1Sam.23|1Sam 23:29]], He dwells at En-gedi.

[^2]: Keilah was a city of Judah, situated, according to Eusebius, eight miles from Eleutheropolis, towards Hebron. Sozomen says that the prophet Habakkuk's tomb was shewn there. [[Josh.15|Josh 15:44]]; [[Neh.3|Neh 3:17-18]]

[^4]: ***inquired*** In what way David made this enquiry we are not told; but it was probably by means of Abiathar; and therefore it would seem, that with Houbigant, we should read the [[1Sam.23|1Sam 23:6]] immediately after the [[1Sam.23|1Sam 23:1]]. - This adventure was truly noble and patriotic. Had not David loved his country, and been above all motives of private and personal revenge, he would have rejoiced in this invasion of Judea, as producing a strong diversion in his favour, and embroiling his inveterate enemy. In most cases, a man with David's wrongs would have joined with the enemies of his country, and avenged himself on the author of his calamities; but he thinks of nothing but succouring Keilah, and using his power and influence in behalf of his brethren.

Hence Nabal ([[1Sam.25|1Sam 25:2]]) is described as a man of Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and though he might dwell generally in Maon, yet he is styled Nabal the Carmelite, from the place where his estate lay. Calmet supposes it to be the city Minois, which Eusebius places in the vicinity of Gaza; and the Moenoemi Castrum, which the Theodosian code places near Beersheba.

Here Saul was obliged to separate himself from David, in order to go and oppose the invading Philistines; which deliverance of David was of such a nature as made the Divine interposition fully visible. [[1Sam.23|1Sam 23:28]]

[^53]: The district around En-gedi, near the western coast of the Dead Sea, is reported by travellers to be a mountainous territory, filled with caverns; and consequently, proper for David in his present circumstances. Dr. Lightfoot thinks this was the wilderness of Judah, in which David was when he penned the [[Ps.63|Ps 63:1]], which breathes as much pious and devout affection as almost any of his Psalms; for in all places and in all conditions he still kept up his communion with God. - If Christians knew their privileges better, and acted up thereto, there would be less murmuring at the dark dispensations of Divine Providence.
