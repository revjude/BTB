[^11]: Bochart has collected many curious accounts relative to the terrible devastations made by these mischievous animals. William, Archbishop of Tyre, records, that in the beginning of the twelfth century, a penitential council was held at Naplouse, where five and twenty canons were framed for the correction of the manners of the inhabitants of the Christian kingdom of Jerusalem, who they apprehended had provoked to bring upon them the calamities of earthquakes, war, and famine. This last he ascribes to locusts and devouring mice, which had for four years together so destroyed the fruits of the earth as to cause an almost total failure of their crops. It was customary for the ancient heathen to offer to their gods such monuments of their deliverance as represented the evils from which they had been rescued; and Tavernier informs us, that among the Indians, when a pilgrim goes to one of the pagodas for a cure, he brings the figure of the member affected, made of gold, silver, or copper, according to his circumstances, which he offers to his god.

[^41]: As it is very improbable that the village of Beth–shemesh should contain, or be capable of employing, 50,070 men in the fields at wheat harvest, much less that they could all peep into the ark, and from the uncommon manner in which it is expressed in the original, it is generally allowed that there is some corruption in the text, or that some explanatory word is omitted. The Hebrew is ***shivim ish, chamishim aileph ish***, literally, "seventy men, fifty thousand men." So LXX <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>εβδομηκοντα</span> <span class='asgreek'>ανδρας</span> <span class='asgreek'>και</span> <span class='asgreek'>πεντηκοντα</span> <span class='asgreek'>χιλιαδας</span> <span class='asgreek'>ανδρων</span></span>. Vulgate, ***septuaginta viros, et quinquaginta millia plebis***. "70 (chief) men, and 50,000 common people." Targum, ***besabey amma***, "of the elders of the people 70 men, ***ovekahala***, and in the congregation 50,000 men." But the Syriac, ***chamsho alphin weshivin gavrin***, "5,000 and 70 men;" with which the Arabic agrees; while Josephus has only <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>εβδομηκοντα</span></span>, seventy men; and three reputable manuscripts of Dr. Kennicott's also omit "50,000 men." Some learned men, however, would render, by supplying <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>ξ</span></span>, ***mem***, "70 men; fifty out of a thousand;" which supposes about 1,400 present, and that a twentieth part were slain.
