[^27]: ***and the Lord*** "Hitherto," says Puffendorf, "the people of Israel had lived under governors raised up by God, who had exacted no tribute of them, nor put them to any charge; but little content with this form of government, they desire to have a king like other nations, who should live in magnificence and pomp, keep armies, and be able to resist any invasion. Samuel informs them what it was they desired; that, when they understood it, they might consider whether they would persist in their choice. If they would have a king splendidly attended, he tells them that he would take their sons for his chariots, etc.. If they would have him keep up constant forces, then he would appoint them for colonels and captains, and employ those in his wars who were accustomed to follow their family business; and since, after the manner of other kings, he must keep a stately court, they must be content that their daughters should serve in several offices, which the king would think below the dignity of his wives and daughters ([[1Sam.8|1Sam 8:13]]). In one word, that, to sustain his dignity, their king would exact the tenth of all they possessed, and be maintained in a royal manner out of their estates."
