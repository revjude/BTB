[^28]: Rather, "the net-work of goat's hair at its (the Teraphim's) pillow;" for the ***kevir***, (whence the Chaldee and Syriac ***kavreetho***, a honey-comb, from its net-like form), seems to have been a kind of mosquito-net, which, says Dr. Shaw, is "a close curtain of gauze, used all over the East, by people of fashion, to keep out the flies." That they had such anciently cannot be doubted. Thus when Judith had beheaded Holofernes in his bed ([[1Sam.13|1Sam 13:9]], [[1Sam.13|1Sam 13:15]]) "she pulled down the canopy (or the mosquito net, <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>το</span> <span class='asgreek'>κωνωπειου</span></span>, from <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>κωνωψ</span></span>, a gnat, or mosquito, whence our word canopy) wherein he did lie in his drunkenness, from the pillars."

[^30]: The eastern beds consist merely of two thick cotton quilts, one of which, folded double, serves as a mattress, the other as a covering. Such seems to have been the bed of David, which could easily have been carried, with himself in it, to the presence of Saul.

[^31]: It is highly probable that David, when supposed to be sick, was thought to be hid in the harem or chamber of Michal. "The harems," says Deut. Lam. Motraye, "are sanctuaries, as sacred and inviolable, for persons pursed by justice for any crime, debt, etc., as the Roman Catholic churches in Italy, Spain, Portugal, etc." Thus we find, that to effect his purpose, Saul sent messengers to Michal, but they treated her harem with too much respect to enter it at first; but being authorised by Saul, they entered even into her chamber; and during the delay occasioned by respect for the privacy of Michal, David escaped.
