[^10]: Or, Thus did Samuel before he knew the Lord, and before the word of the Lord was revealed unto him.

[^11]: Samuel was not destitute of the knowledge of God, in that sense which implies the total absence of true piety, as Eli's sons were; for he knew and worshipped the God of Israel, but he did not know him as communicating special revelations of his will to him, in the manner in which he made it known to the prophets. [[Jer.9|Jer 9:24]]; [[Acts.19|Acts 19:2]]

[^12]: [[Job.33|Job 33:14-15]]; Although Samuel did not apprehend the way in which God reveals himself to his servants the prophets - by the "still small voice" - yet when this direct communication from the Almighty was made the third time, in a way altogether new and strange to him, it seems astonishing that he did not immediately apprehend. Perhaps he would have been sooner aware of a divine revelation, had it come in a dream or a vision. Those who have the greatest knowledge of divine things, should remember the time when they were as babes, unskilful in the word of righteousness. [[1Cor.13|1Cor 13:11-12]]

[^14]: This seems to imply a visible appearance, as well as an audible voice.

[^15]: [[1Sam.3|1Sam 3:4-6]], [[1Sam.3|1Sam 3:8]]; Samuel did not now rise and run as before, when thought he Eli called, but lay still and listened. All must be silent, when God speaks. Observe, however, Samuel in his reply left out one word. He did not say, Speak, Lord, but only Speak, for thy servant heareth; perhaps, as Bp. Patrick suggests, out of uncertainty, whether it was God that spake to him or not. However, by this answer way was made for the message he was now to receive, and Samuel was brought acquainted with the words of God and visions of the Almighty.

[^27]: [[1Sam.1|1Sam 1:9]]; [[Mal.1|Mal 1:10]]

[^28]: Samuel reverenced Eli as a father, and feared to distress him by shewing what God had purposed to do. It does not appear that God commanded Samuel to deliver this message; he therefore did not attempt it till adjured by Eli. It might be supposed that Samuel would have been so full of ecstasy as to have forgotten his ordinary service, and run amongst his friends to tell them of the converse he had with God in the night, but he modestly keeps it to himself. Our secret communion with God is not to be proclaimed on the house-top.
