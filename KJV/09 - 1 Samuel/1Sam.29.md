$\quad$ <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[1Sam.29.6|6]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, \[as\] the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> liveth, thou hast<small><small>[^12]</small></small> been upright, and thy going<small><small>[^13]</small></small> out and thy coming in with me in the host \[is\] good in my sight: for I have not<small><small>[^14]</small></small> found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour<small><small>[^15]</small></small> thee not.<small><small>[^16]</small></small> <span class="startversemarker">[</span>**[[1Sam.29.7|7]]**<span class="endversemarker">]</span> Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease<small><small>[^17]</small></small> not the lords of the Philistines.

[^1]:  [[1Sam.29|1Sam 29:1]], David marching with the Philistines, [[1Sam.29|1Sam 29:3]], is disallowed by their princes; [[1Sam.29|1Sam 29:6]], Achish dismisses him, with commendations of his fidelity.

[^10]: The princes reasoned wisely, according to the common practice of mankind; and it was well for David that they were such good politicians. It was ordered by a gracious Providence that they refused to let David go with them to this battle, in which he must have been either an enemy to his country, or false to his friends and to his trust. Had he fought for the Philistines, he would have fought against God and his country; and had he in the battle gone over to the Israelites, he would have deceived and become a traitor to the hospitable Achish. God therefore delivered him from such disgrace; and by the same kind Providence he was sent back to rescue his wives, and the wives and children of his people, from captivity.

[^25]: Jezreel, or Esdrelon, was a city of Issachar, afterwards celebrated as the residence of the kings of Israel, delightfully situated in the extensive and fertile plain of the same name, which extends from Scythopolis or Bethshan on the east to mount Carmel on the west. Eusebius and Jerome inform us, that it was in their time a place of considerable consequence, lying between Scythopolis on the east and Legio on the west; and the latter (on [[Hos.1|Hos 1:1-11]]). informs us that it was pretty near Maximianopolis. The Jerusalem Itinerary places it ten miles west from Scythopolis; and William of Tyre says it was called Little Gerinum in his time, and that there was a fine fountain in it, whose waters fell into the Jordan near Scythopolis.
