[^2]: Nob appears to have been a sacerdotal city of Benjamin or Ephraim. Jerome says, that in his time the ruins of it might be seen not far from Diospolis or Lydda. But the Rabbins assert that Jerusalem might be seen from this town. The tabernacle resided some time at Nob; and after it was destroyed, it was removed to Gibeon; "and the day of Nob and Gibeon were fifty-seven years." Maimonides in Bethhabbechirah, c. 1.

[^5]: The whole of this is a gross falsehood; and which was attended with the most fatal consequences. It is well known that from all antiquity it was held no crime to tell a lie in order to save life. Thus Diphilon <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>Υπολαμβανω</span> <span class='asgreek'>το</span> <span class='asgreek'>ψευδας</span> <span class='asgreek'>επι</span> <span class='asgreek'>σωτηρια</span> <span class='asgreek'>λεγομενον</span></span>, <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>ουδεν</span> <span class='asgreek'>περιποιεισθαι</span> <span class='asgreek'>δυσχερες</span></span>. "I hold it right to tell a lie for safety. Nothing should be avoided to save life." An heathen may say or sing thus, but no Christian can act thus and save his soul, though he may save his life.

[^24]: Jerome says there was a large town called Gath, in the way from Eleutheropolis to Gaza; and Eusebius speaks of another Gath, five miles from Eleutheropolis, towards Lydda (and consequently different from that mentioned by Jerome); and also of another Gath, between Jamnia and Antipatris. It appears to have been the extreme boundary of the Philistine territory in one direction, as Ekron was on the other ([[1Sam.7|1Sam 7:14]]; [[1Sam.17|1Sam 17:52]]), and lay near Mareshah ([[2Chr.11|2Chr 11:8]]. [[Mic.1|Mic 1:14]]), which agrees pretty well with the position assigned it by Jerome. But Reland and Dr. Wells agree with Eusebius; and the authors of the Universal History (b. i. c. 7) place it about six miles form Jamnia, fourteen south of Joppa, and thirty-two west of Jerusalem.
