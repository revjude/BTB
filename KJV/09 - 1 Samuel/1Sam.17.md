[^11]: According to Bp. Cumberland's calculation, the height of Goliath was about eleven feet ten inches; but Parkhurst estimating the ordinary cubit at seventeen inches and a half, calculates that he was nine feet six inches high. Few instances can be produced of men who can be compared with him. Pliny says, "The tallest man that hath been seen in our days was one name Gabara, who, in the days of Claudius, the late Emperor, was brought out of Arabia. He was nine feet nine inches." Josephus mentions a Jew, named Eleazar, whom Vitellius sent to Rome, who was seven cubits, or ten feet two inches high. Becanus saw a man near ten feet, and a woman that was full ten feet. And, to mention no more, a man of the name of John Middleton, born at Hale, near Warrington, in Lancashire, in the reign of James the First, was more than nine feet high. Dr. Plott, in his history of Staffordshire, says, that "his hand, from the carpus to the end of the middle finger, was seventeen inches, his palms eight inches and a half broad, and his whole height was nine feet three inches; wanting but six inches of the height of Goliath of Gath."

[^34]: Dr. Richardson says, that in about twenty minutes, in an easterly direction, form the cave of St. John (which is about two hours or six miles, in a westerly direction, from Jerusalem), they came to the valley of Elah; which position seems to agree with that of Shochoh and Azekah. He describes it as "a small valley, and the place of the encampment is pointed out where it narrows into a broad, deep ravine; part of it was in crop, and part of it was under the plough, which was drawn by a couple of oxen. A small stream, which had shrunk almost under its stony bed, passes through it from east to west, from which we are informed that David chose out five smooth stones, and hasted and ran to meet the haughty champion of Gath. A well of water under the bank, with a few olive trees above, on the north side of the valley, are said to mark the spot of the shepherd's triumph over his boasting antagonist. Saul and his men probably occupied the side of the valley which is nearest to Jerusalem, on which the ground is higher and more rugged than on the other side." [[1Sam.17|1Sam 17:19]]

But, as Bp. Horsley observes, it appears, from many circumstances of the story, that David's combat with Goliath was many years prior to Saul's madness, and David's introduction to him as a musician. In the first place, David was quite a youth when he engaged with Goliath ([[1Sam.17|1Sam 17:33]] and [[1Sam.17|1Sam 17:42]]). When introduced to Saul he was of full age ([[1Sam.16|1Sam 16:18]]). Again, this combat was his first appearance in public life, and his first military exploit ([[1Sam.17|1Sam 17:36]], [[1Sam.17|1Sam 17:38-39]]). When introduced as a musician, he was a man of established character, and a man of war ([[1Sam.16|1Sam 16:18]]). Now the just conclusion is, that the last ten verses of [[1Sam.16|1Sam 16:14]] have been misplaced; their true place being between the ninth and tenth verses of [[Josh.18|Josh 18:9]]. Let them be removed there, and the whole apparent disorder will be removed.

[^75]: Parallel instances of vaunting occur in some writers of a more recent date. - The conspirators against the emperor Maximinus having slain him, his son, and several of his best friends, threw out their bodies to be devoured by dogs and the fowls of the air. This custom appears to have been frequently threatened; and, however shocking to human feelings, was often carried into effect.

[^88]: The tradition of the combat between David and Goliath, in which the latter was killed, is preserved among the Arabs; for he is mentioned in the Koran, where he is called Galut or Jalut. The Arabs also call the dynasty of the Philistine kings, who reigned in Palestine when the Hebrews came there, Galutiah, or Jalutiah. Achmed Al Fassi says, "Those kings were as well known by the name of Jalaut, as the ancient kings of Egypt by that of Pharaoh. David killed the Jalaut who reigned in his time, and entirely rooted out the Philistines, the rest of whom fled into Africa, and from them descended the Brebers or Berbers, who inhabit the coast of Barbary." It is remarkable that the Berbers themselves should acknowledge their descent from the Philistines. "The name Goliath, which they pronounce Sghialud, is very common among the Brebers, and the history of the champion of the Philistines is very well known to the Moors. When children quarrel, and the bigger one challenges the smaller to fight the latter answers, 'Who will fight with you? ***Enta men ulid Sgialud***. You are of the race of Golaith.' The Jews who dwell among them, on the mountains, all call them Philistines." [[1Sam.21|1Sam 21:9]], [[1Sam.23|1Sam 23:21]]; [[Judg.3|Judg 3:31]], [[Judg.15|Judg 15:15]]
