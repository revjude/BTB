In reply to sceptical objections, it is sufficient to observe, that he who could raise Lazarus from the dead, could, with a much less exertion of power, have so loosened or removed the bandages of his feet and legs as to have rendered it practicable for him to come forth. Tittman well observes, that Lazarus was restored not only to life but also to health, as appears from the alacrity of his motion; and this would constitute a new miracle.

Accordingly we find that a desert, or wilderness, extended from Jericho to Beth–el ([[Josh.16|Josh 16:1]]), called the wilderness of Beth–aven ([[Josh.18|Josh 18:12]]), in which Joshua and the Israelites slew the inhabitants of Ai.
