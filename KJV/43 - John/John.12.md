Jones with the ***sumbul*** of the Persians and Arabs, and ***jatamansi*** of the Hindoos; and he considers it a species of the ***valerian***, of the ***triandria monogynia*** class of plants. The root is from three to twelve inches long, fibrous, sending up above the earth between thirty and forty ears or spikes, from which it has its name; stem, lower part perennial, upper part herbaceous, sub-erect, simple, from six to twelve inches long; leaves entire, smooth, fourfold, the inner radical pair petioled and cordate, the rest sessile and lanceolate; pericarp, a single seed crowned with a pappus.
