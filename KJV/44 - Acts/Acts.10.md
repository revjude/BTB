The spirit of the heavenly direction seems to be this, say Dr. A. Clarke, "The middle wall of the partition is now pulled down; the Jews and Gentiles are called to become one flock, under one shepherd and bishop of souls. Thou, Peter, shalt open the door of faith to the Gentiles, and be also the minister of the circumcision. Rise up; already a blessed sacrifice is prepared. Go and offer it to God; and let thy soul feed on the fruits of his mercy," etc.

[^57]: ***Caesarea*** This city, once an obscure fortress called Strato's Tower, was built and superbly decorated by Herod the Great and called Cesarea, in honour of Augustus Cesar, to whom he dedicated it in the 28th year of his reign. It was situated on the shore of the Mediterranean, between Joppa and Dora, with a haven, rendered by Herod the most convenient on the coast. According to Ibn Idris and Abulfeda, 30 miles from Jaffa or Joppa, 32 from Ramlay, and 36 from Acco or Ptolemais; and, according to Josephus, 600 stadia, or 75 miles from Jerusalem, though the real distance is probably not more than 62 miles. Nothing now remains of the former splendour of Cesarea. The supposed sites of the ancient edifices are mere mounds of indefinable form; the waves wash the ruins of the mole, the tower, and the port; the whole of the surrounding country is a sandy desert; and not a creature except beasts of prey, resides within many miles of this silent desolation.
