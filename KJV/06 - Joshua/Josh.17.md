The lot of Manasseh therefore was divided into ten parts; five for the five sons of Gilead, Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, and Shemida; and five for the five daughters of Zelophehad, Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

[^16]: Situated, probably, east of Shechem, though its precise situation, as well as that of many others, cannot, at this distance of time, be ascertained. Many of these towns were small, and we may rationally conclude, slightly built; and consequently have perished more than two thousand years ago. It would therefore be useless now to look for such places; though in many instances, their ancient names have been preserved, and their sites identified. Several towns even in England, mentioned by Cesar and other ancient writers, are no longer discernible; several have changed their names, and not a few their situation. [[Josh.16|Josh 16:6-8]]

It was the largest city of the Decapolis, and the only one on that side of Jordan.
