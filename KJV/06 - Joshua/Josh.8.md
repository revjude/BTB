[^3]: It would seem, from this verse, that all that were capable of bearing arms were to march out of the camp on this occasion: 30,000 formed an ambuscade in one place; and 5,000 were placed in another, who all gained their positions in the night. With the rest of the army, Joshua appeared the next morning before Ai, which the men of that city would naturally suppose was the whole of the Israelitish force and, consequently, be the more emboldened to come out and attack them. Some, however, think that 30,000 men were the whole that were employed on this occasion, 5,000 of whom were placed in ambush on the west of the city, between Beth–el and Ai ([[Josh.8|Josh 8:12]]), and, with the rest, Joshua appeared before the city in the morning. The king, seeing but about 25,000 coming against him, though he had but 12,000 persons in the whole city ([[Josh.8|Josh 8:25]]), determined to risk a battle, issued out, and was defeated by stratagem.

[^32]: Beth–el is not mentioned in the Greek version, and some, with Houbigant and Pilkington, think it was not originally in the Hebrew; because, had the men of Beth–el pursued, as well as those of Ai, it would have been said that they left the cities, and not the city, open. The principal strength of Beth–el might have been previously taken into Ai, as the strongest place to make a stand in; Beth–el being but about three miles westward from Ai.

[^42]: Joshua seems to have been not only the general but the standard-bearer of the army ([[Josh.8|Josh 8:18]]), and continued in this employment, by holding up or extending his spear, during the whole of the battle; and did not slacken from the pursuit till the forces of Ai were utterly discomfited. Some commentators, however, understand this action in a figurative sense, like the holding up of Moses' hands, as if it implied that Joshua continued in prayer for the success of his troops, nor ceased till the armies of Ai were annihilated, and the city taken and destroyed.
