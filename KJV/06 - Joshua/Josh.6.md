[^9]: ***trumpets of rams'*** The words ***shopheroth hyyovelim***, should rather be rendered jubilee, trumpets, i.e., such as were used on the jubilee, which were probably made of horn or silver.

[^39]: The Canaanites were ripe for destruction; and God was pleased, instead of destroying them by a pestilence, a famine, or an earthquake, to employ the Israelites as the executioners of his vengeance. Had an angel been commissioned to slay them, who would have charged him with iniquity or cruelty? In all public calamities infants are involved; and tens of thousands of infants die in great agony every year. Now, either God is not the agent in these calamities (which opinion, though often implied in men's reasonings on these subjects, is not far from atheism); or they must consist with the most perfect justice and goodness.
