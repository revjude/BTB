[^27]: Joshua doubtless acted, on this occasion, by an immediate impulse upon his mind from the Spirit of God. The terms here employed to record the miracle, agree with the accustomed manner in which the the motions of the earth and sun are described in our own day. The sun apparently moves, but really is stationary; while the diurnal movement of the earth on its axis is by us unnoticed, and would not have been known except by astronomical science. The sun appeared to the Israelites over Gibeon, and the moon over the valley of Ajalon, and there they stayed in their course for "a whole day." Many vain enquiries have been made concerning the way in which this miracle was wrought, and many difficulties and objections have been urged against understanding it literally. But the fact is authenticated by the Divine testimony; and the manner in which it was accomplished lies entirely out of our province, because beyond our comprehension.

[^39]: This information brought to Joshua, is an evidence that there were those of the country, who knew the holes and fastnesses of it, that were in his interests. And the care Joshua took to secure them there, as it is an instance of his policy and presence of mind, even in the heat of action; so, in the success of their project, it shews how they who think to hide themselves from God, not only deceive, but destroy themselves. Their refuge of lies will but bind them over to God's judgment.

[^62]: This city was situated in the south of Judah, and in the district of Eleutheropolis, according to Eusebius and Jerome. It is probably the Libnah in the neighbourhood of which the Israelites encamped.

[^63]: Lachish was also situated in the south of Judah, seven miles south from Eleutheropolis, according to Eusebius and Jerome. It appears to have been anciently a very strong place; for though the people were panic struck, and the Israelites flushed with success, yet Joshua could not reduce it till the second day; and the king of Assyria afterwards was obliged to raise the siege.

[^65]: Gezer was situated on the confines of Ephraim and Manasseh, between Beth-horon and the sea; and is evidently the village of Gazara mentioned by Eusebius, four miles (north) from Nicopolis or Emmaus.

[^66]: This town appears to have been no great distance from Lachish, with which it is mentioned, [[Josh.15|Josh 15:39]], as one of the cities given to Judah. [[Josh.10|Josh 10:3]], [[Josh.12|Josh 12:12]], [[Josh.15|Josh 15:39]]

[^70]: From [[Josh.10|Josh 10:23]], we learn that the king of Hebron was one of the five whom Joshua slew and hanged on five trees at Makkedah. This slaying of the king of Hebron, therefore, must either refer to what had already been done, or the Hebronites had set up another, whom Joshua now slew when he took the city.

[^71]: [[Josh.10|Josh 10:35]]

[^72]: Debir was situated in the south of the tribe of Judah, near Hebron. The expression of Joshua's returning to Debir, probably denotes, that having carried his conquests in the southern parts as far as Gaza ([[Josh.10|Josh 10:41]]), which was in the south-west angle of Canaan, he then marched back to besiege Debir.
