[^8]: These tribes furnished more habitation to the Levites, in proportion, than any of the other tribes, because they possessed a more extensive inheritance, agreeably to what Moses had commanded ([[Num.35|Num 35:8]]). It is worthy of remark, that the principal part of this tribe, whose business was to minister at the sanctuary, which sanctuary was afterwards established at Jerusalem, had their appointment nearest to that city; so that they were always within reach of the sacred work which God had appointed them.

[^46]: Aner and Bileam are mentioned in Chronicles, instead of Tanach and Gath–rimmon ([[1Chr.6|1Chr 6:70]]). Either the cities had at this time different names, or afterwards their names were changed; or the Levites, being by some means dispossessed of the cities first assigned them, received others from their brethren. A careful examination of the marginal references will discover other variations of this kind, which may be accounted for in the same manner.

But these two verses, are thus absolutely necessary for the truth and consistency of this chapter, are happily preserved in no less than 149 manuscripts collated by Dr. Kennicott, and upwards of 40 collated by De Rossi.
