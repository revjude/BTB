[^61]: As it is certain that the tribe of Naphtali did not border upon that of Judah, there being several tribes between, we should probably omit Judah, with the Septuagint; though it may have been a town so called.

[^69]: Supposed by some to be the same as Beth–shemesh in the tribe of Judah; but this latter city is evidently distinguished from it by being assigned by the tribe of Judah to the Levites ([[Josh.21|Josh 21:16]]).

[^70]: Eusebius calls it <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>Σαλαβα</span></span>, and places it in Samaria, and Jerome calls it Salebi ([[Ezek.48|Ezek 48:1-35]]), and joins it to Ajalon and Emmaus. [[Judg.1|Judg 1:35]], Shaalbim

[^71]: This appears to be the Ajalon which Jerome places two miles from Nicopolis or Emmaus, in the road to Jerusalem. [[Josh.10|Josh 10:12]], [[Josh.21|Josh 21:24]]; [[1Sam.14|1Sam 14:31]]

[^73]: Ekron is placed by Eusebius between Ashdod and Jamnia, eastward; and probably the ruined village of Tookrair, mentioned by Dr. Richarson, situated on the top of a hill, and which he says seems to have been a place of considerable consequence, occupies its site.
