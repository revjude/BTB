As to its shape, the LXX calls it <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>επωμις</span></span>, which signifies that it was worn on the shoulders. So also Josephus, who says it was a cubit long. St. Jerome compares it with the Roman ***caracalla***, which was a sort of short cloak, only that it had a head or hood, which the ephod had not.

[^19]: The ***kethoneth***, or coat, was made of linen; but the form of it is no where described in Scripture, except in the visionary appearance of Christ to St. John, in the form and habit of a priest ([[Rev.1|Rev 1:13]]); where he is said to be <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>ενδεδυμενος</span> <span class='asgreek'>ποδηρη</span></span>, "clothed with a garment down to the feet," which perfectly agrees with the description the Jewish writers give of it; who also say, that it had sleeves which came down to the wrist, and was tied about the neck; so that it was not unlike a long shirt. It was common to all the priests; but the tunic of the high priest was made of finer linen, or wove in a more curious manner ([[Exod.28|Exod 28:4]]).

Part of the blood was applied, not as that of the sin offering, to the horns of the altar, but to Aaron and his sons; to the tips of their right ears, the thumbs of their right hands, and the great toes of their right feet. Implying their obligation to hearken diligently to the word of God - to do his work in the best manner which they could, and to walk in his ways with steady perseverance; and also, that they could not do these things acceptably except through the atoning blood, received and applied by faith. Then part of the blood reserved upon the altar, probably in a basin for that purpose, was mingled with the holy anointing oil, and sprinkled on the garments both of Aaron and his sons, to hallow them to the Lord. "This may be looked upon as a lively representation of our purification by the blood of jesus Christ, through his Holy Spirit." - Bp. Patrick
