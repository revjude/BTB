[^17]: Heb. ***Azazel***, that is, the goat-gone-away, The Hebrew <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>ςζ</span>ΰ<span class='asgreek'>ζμ</span></span> has been supposed by some to be the name of a place, either a mountain or cliff, to which the goat was led. But no place of that name has ever been pointed out, except a mountain near Sinai, which was too distant for the goat to be conducted there from Jerusalem. Other learned men think it was the name of the devil, who was worshipped by the heathen in the form of a goat. But Bp. Patrick justly objects to this opinion; for it is difficult to conceive, that when the other goat was offered to God, this should be sent among demons. The more probable opinion seems to be, that it was name given to the goat itself, on account of his being let go; from ***aiz***, a goat, and ***azal***, to depart. So LXX <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>αποπομπαιος</span></span>, and Vulgate ***emissarius***, sent away; Aquila and Symmachus <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>τραγος</span> <span class='asgreek'>απερχομενος</span></span>, or <span class="asgreek"><span class='asgreek'>απολελυμενος</span></span>: the goat going away, or dismissed.
