[^1]:  [[Lev.27|Lev 27:1]], He that makes a singular vow must be the Lord’s; [[Lev.27|Lev 27:3]], The estimation of the person; [[Lev.27|Lev 27:9]], of a beast given by vow; [[Lev.27|Lev 27:14]], of a house; [[Lev.27|Lev 27:16]], of a field, and the redemption thereof; [[Lev.27|Lev 27:28]], No devoted thing may be redeemed; [[Lev.27|Lev 27:30]], The tithe may not be changed.

[^2]: [[Gen.28|Gen 28:20-22]]; [[Num.6|Num 6:2]], [[Num.21|Num 21:2]]; [[Deut.23|Deut 23:21-23]]; [[Judg.11|Judg 11:30-31]], [[Judg.11|Judg 11:39]]; [[1Sam.1|1Sam 1:11]], [[1Sam.1|1Sam 1:28]]

[^3]: A vow is a religious promise made to God, for the most part with prayer, and paid with thanksgiving. Vows were either of abstinence ([[Num.6|Num 6:1-27]] and [[Num.30|Num 30:1-16]]), or the devoting of something to the Lord, as sacrifices ([[Lev.7|Lev 7:16]]), or the value of persons, beasts, houses, or lands, concerning which the law is here given. A man might vow or devote himself, his children, his domestics, his cattle, his goods, etc.; and respecting the redemption of all these, rules are laid down in this chapter. But if, after consecrating these things, he refused to redeem them, they then became the Lord's property forever. The persons continued all their lives devoted to the sanctuary, the goods were sold for the profit of the temple, or the priests; and the animals, if clean, were offered in sacrifice; and if not proper for sacrifice, were sold, and the proceeds devoted to sacred uses. This is a general view of the different laws relative to vows, mentioned in this chapter. [[Eccl.5|Eccl 5:4-5]]

[^7]: i.e., 4£. 10s. sterling, A little more than one-half the value of a man; for this obvious reason, that a woman, if employed, would not be of so much use in the sanctuary as the man. [[Zech.11|Zech 11:12-13]]; [[Matt.26|Matt 26:15]], [[Matt.27|Matt 27:9-10]]

[^24]: Though the words "some part" are not expressed, yet it is generally allowed that they should be supplied here; as it was not lawful for a man to alienate in this manner his whole patrimony. He might express his good will for the house of God but he must not impoverish his own family.

[^25]: [[Acts.4|Acts 4:34-37]], [[Acts.5|Acts 5:4]]

[^26]: or, the land of an homer, etc. i.e. as much land as required a homer of barley to sow it, The ***homer*** was very different from the ***omer***; the latter held about three quarts, the former seventy-five gallons three pints. [[Isa.5|Isa 5:10]]; [[Ezek.45|Ezek 45:11-14]]; [[Hos.3|Hos 3:2]]

[^38]: Heb. first born, etc. As these firstlings were the Lord's before, it would have been a solemn mockery to pretend to make them a matter of a singular vow; for they were already appointed, if clean, to be sacrificed.

[^39]: [[Exod.13|Exod 13:2]], [[Exod.13|Exod 13:12-13]], [[Exod.22|Exod 22:30]]; [[Num.18|Num 18:17]]; [[Deut.15|Deut 15:19]]

[^40]: This was probably intended to prevent rash vows and covetous redemptions. The priest alone was to value the thing; and to whatever his valuation was, a fifth part must be added by him who wished to redeem it. [[Lev.27|Lev 27:11-13]]

[^41]: This is the ***cherem***, the absolute, irredeemable grant to God.

[^46]: The Rabbins say, that when a man gave the tithe of his sheep or calves, he shut them in one fold, in which was a narrow door, to let out but one at a time. He then stood by the door, with a rod dipped in vermilion in his hand, and as they passed he counted them with the rod; and when the tenth came he touched it, by which it was distinguished as the tithe calf, sheep, etc. [[Jer.33|Jer 33:13]]; [[Ezek.20|Ezek 20:37]]; [[Mic.7|Mic 7:14]]
